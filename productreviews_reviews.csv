1 out of 5 stars,2023-04-04T05:46:34.000Z,SO TERRIBLE PLEASE DON’T NEVER TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS,"We are in at least April 2023 and still in the same situation even worse nothing has changed since , Opencollege still taking payment of money without doing nothing. The educator is never here to correct my courses , and customer service is the worse I never seen in my life .Now I understand why so many bad reviews aboutOpencollege, it should be shared with a lot of people to avoid falling into the trap.Almost 4 months that I am with open college and too much delay, too much injustice, in the process motivation of the students, have completed... Read more the modules and still waiting teachers to review my modules to let me completed the work placement there is not following close with student , they do everything to put the students very very low, very unfair. despite the calls, etc...conversation it gets worse and worse.
Majority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist and teachers don't care about it even you try to explain that the link are not working anymore.
Teachers putting not satisfactory every second paragraph even I try my best. They booked me appointment for teacher training finally canceled it without raison and confirmation, they are not care about students
Customer service are speaking not really correctly and are not understanding what is sure I will talk about open college a lot so that ,avoids people to fall in the trap.
I'm still waiting for how long ????

I was very satisfied with the course content and find it useful in my current job. The course held significant amount of difficulty where I was challenged, yet the assignments were able to be completed."
1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-30T05:56:15.000Z,SCAM!!!!,I believe this place is a scam. I canceled the course with them within the 7 day cooling period and was told that the course was canceled. 6 weeks later they have taken $330 out of my account and still counting. I have called 5 times only to sit on hold for over an hour and have someone tell me that the money would be refunded. This has not been the case. Today was the 5th call with someone telling me the same story. Stay far far away from this place.
1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-28T00:16:27.000Z,Do not enrol with open colleges,"Its very draining and frustrating I enrolled in nail certificate III last year November and I am now regretting choosing open college for my course as I was almost finished with my academic work and they did not help me to find my placement as they say in beginning when you enquire them''we will help you to find placement in case you don't find''  and they did not help at all.Student support made me to do my course again due to transition from openspace to open spaceX. all time they have technical issues which need to be fixed to continue my co... Read moreurse and I contacted student support its been more than three weeks I am calling and emailing them. I have 12 months to finish my course I feel half of time I will be waiting  fix technical issues . I am not getting any reply back from student support and technical issues are not fixed, do not know what to do . I feel I have no choice of taking this further and make formal complaint against them as I have had enough. All open college is want just your money . I would suggest do not study with open college"
1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-23T13:56:17.000Z,This College and the people who run it are useless,"I've finished my course.  I have called Open Colleges over 10 times in the past fortnight via email and phone call for an email confirmation so I can attend interviews.  Since finishing or since paying my course off I have had no communication from this crap of a College.  No email, no text, no phone call.  Nothing.  I have an interview on Monday, it's Thursday.  I've called and called and emailed.  No communication whatsoever.  Absolutely furious."
5 out of 5 stars,2023-03-23T09:54:17.000Z,Thank you,"I have learnt a lot , very useful material Dorina the assessor is  very supportive and so friendly , she replies very quick even if it's weekendShe kept pushing me to finish on timeI really appreciate it"
1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-18T06:27:50.000Z,"Don't waste your money, SCAM","I am stuck studying the Diploma of Counselling. I submitted my very last assessment on the 10 December 2022, it is now 18 March 2023 and haven't heard from anyone. This is when in thier own policy states, assessments are marked within 10-15 days. I've sent emails to facilitators and student support, only to fall on deaf ears. This institution just wants your money, as when your about to qualify they go to ground. I also made a formal complaint through the institution again falling on deaf ears. I have now made a formal complaint through Austral... Read moreian Skills and Quality Authority due to the non existent support. Also dont hold your breath if you have to do work placement. They pretend to help by asking for an application but do nothing. We get taught to do assessment plans perhaps this college needs to learn how to do management plans as its appalling. The main and only assessor is in the UK while there is a backlog of assessments. Continous smoke and mirrors and no action. What is the college doing to rectify this, NOTHING. Do this Diploma through AIPC or a selected university with good reviews."
5 out of 5 stars,2023-03-15T12:02:12.000Z,Open college is the way to start your studies!!,Honestly Dorina my teacher has made my learning experience very easy and stress free. I don’t think I would be able to complete the course without her help.The over all course of my certificate III in dental assisting was very informative and had easy access.Support team was always there when needed and where very helpful.Definitely would do a course with Open colleges again !!
1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-14T09:21:03.000Z,"Unprofessional people, worst college",If I can rate it lower than 1 star I will! The course is 2 yrs instead of 18 Months. The course coordinator is not helpful. If you defer though you’re done with the module she will still ask you to attend the class again. Not practical. I suggest do uni than study with them or enrol elsewhere.. theory can be done online with other colleges.

I would have also chosen to study with them if I had known about them before I started with open college. I was doing really well for the first 2 weeks and hit a stumbling block. I reached out for help and was given a very vague response. The expectations of some of the assignments are not clear and it is hard to find more information on what is expected. I then go covid, then found a new job (part of the reason I chose to start studying).  I chose the new job over the St... Read moreride learning job. Stride learning, during the interview, stated that they call people after two weeks of no progress. They talk them through any issues and strive to have zero dropouts for any other reason than those that are compassionate and compelling. I got one email that looked like an advertisement after 8 weeks of not doing anything. Didn't get anything else. no emails no phone calls to offer support until I asked to withdraw from the course. I tried to complain and state that if they had followed their duty of care and called me earlier, like in July or August, I may have been able to either complete the assignment or withdraw from it earlier and be able to get more money back than I am getting now... I missed the October cut-off because of their lack of care. STAY AWAY"
5 out of 5 stars,2023-03-05T10:00:45.000Z,Excellent RTO(s) than TAFE NSW,"Open College (100%) fits with my study needs & very self paced non stressful environment. The Staff was really easily to handle over the phone and the trainer itself. I have study at TAFE digital, thier serivces wasn't very pleasant to learn, very emotionally stressed out constantly and very high demanding & Teachers doesn't know what they are doing most of the time.Open College Portal (Open Space X) is very simple and easily to navigate with a click of q button. had podcast, Intractive video and quiz.To be Honest, paying for Open College is an investment toward me career. I recommend this RTO provider, if it is within your allocated budget."

1 out of 5 stars,2023-03-02T13:30:38.000Z,Computer Programmer,"Paid my money to them for a course in programming ($3000) and had nothing but trouble. Absolutely no support, in fact when you did ask for help it took them a week to answer you. The support worker that was to support me was on holiday for 3 weeks. In the end I stopped paying them, which they then threatened me we legal action and I was left out of pocket and left me with nothing. Be very aware of this company."
1 out of 5 stars,2023-02-23T02:43:13.000Z,Don’t study with them.,"Do not study with them. Minimal support, changed coursed half way through and wouldn’t credit modules that were done. In placement and changed assessments could provide assessments for work placement.Do not waste your money and time with them."
1 out of 5 stars,2023-02-22T23:05:51.000Z,disappointed in the whole course,"I have recently been transitioned over to the upgraded version of my course. Prior to this happening there was zero check in from the teaching staff to see how I was going with the course. You would only ever hear from the teaching staff when you submitted an assignment and they provided your result and feedback. I contacted student support many times to find out information only to be given incorrect information every single time. I was even told by Student Support that there was weekly webinars for my course - this I know to be incredibly wro... Read moreng as there was no link to weekly webinars anywhere on the learning system and the last thing to be uploaded was in 2018. Not to mention all course content was out of date and written incredibly poorly. 
I have now been transitioned over to the upgraded version of the course along with the new OpenSpaceX learning system. I am unable to access any of the interactive course content through the learning system as I keep getting notifications that the openspace website is refusing to connect. How am I meant to successfully complete my course if I cannot access the content. I would also like to point out that the blogs I am required to review are not hyperlinked nor is the URL listed so that is now more course content I am unable to access. Yu have removed the ability to email the teaching staff from the new learning system so my only option is to contact Student Support who are inadequately trained and wouldn't have a clue with what is going on. The ability to online chat with anyone has been temporarily disconnected so even if i wanted to speak to Student Support through that avenue, I cant. and when you try to contact Student Support via the phone you receive a automated message saying all staff are in a meeting and then the line is cut. I work for a TAFE and we would never have the phone lines completely unmanned. This gives an incredibly bad student experience. 
This whole experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. You feel like you are completely on your own with no contact from the school, using incomplete content and hoping like crazy you will be able to successfully complete the course with non existent content and incorrect information.  
Open Colleges, do better!!"
1 out of 5 stars,2022-11-24T22:19:12.000Z,Waste of time and money - Cert 4 in Allied Health Assistance,"They don't mark your assessments on time, they don't answer your emails on time, the links to the videos on the content are for the most part unavailable and I even got marked down on an assignment for using a term that was in their own course material. That they claim the term was outdated...on their own material!!Then they give you no help what so ever in getting work placement.

1 out of 5 stars,2022-11-22T01:41:48.000Z,"ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE! Great at lying, take your money and run the other way","I started the Diploma in Social Media Marketing in 2020 as I was really interested in the field. When I spoke to Troy about signing up, I remember on the phone, he mentioned that if I wasn't enjoying the particular course or my interests changed, I could transfer to a different one but continue paying the original course amount. However, this was a lie as I was told I cannot do this.In 2021 I started to feel the course was boring, it was not challenging and it was all very simple learning. I learn best with a challenge and this just did not o... Read moreffer that. The information was basic, the videos were boring and overall, it was just a simple course, did not feel like a diploma and I was not enjoying it. 

I originally asked if I could cancel my course and pay out some sort of fees for cancelling, I explained my situation and how I found the course boring and to quote their very words from Vanita: ""Sometimes, students ask to transfer because they find the course difficult or have fallen behind due to personal issues. We understand that online study can be challenging at times and it takes dedication and determination to stay motivated"" - I found this response extremely offensive, especially after I explained my reasoning and they were to say my determination was lacking basically, when that was not true. I know how to study online as I completed majority of my high school and all of my VCE via distance education, so I know the drill to online learning.

After many emails back and forth, I eventually got them to cancel my course and pay a very small fee. 
I ran for the hills after this and I will NEVER study with Open Colleges again.
Their administration team are very offensive, robotic and have no sympathy for any of their students. They take your money and make it extremely hard to get out of it. Even when larger universities and colleges ALLOW you to change subjects, what makes Open Colleges different? 

Pathetic company, do yourself a favour and do NOT study with them."

Special Considerations have no compassion or empathy for their students. Got changed 40% to cancel course for my limited contact with trainers. Also found out that course is being updated which they knew before I signed on and I get told they can't validate my diploma unless I finish early.WHAT A JOKE . Money grabbing scheme with no help from anyone

I have not been back on since December last year, which they have access to.After weeks of attempting to cancel the course due to extreme personal circumstances.

1 out of 5 stars,2022-10-28T04:24:54.000Z,Avoid at all costs!,"I'm still scarred from my experience of opencolleges and tell everyone I possibly can to stay away.I was doing my cert.3 in dental nursing and it was a nightmare from the start. The content was just links to  youtube videos and incredibly broad and poorly detailed information on the subject, for the first month I spent more time on google looking up subject matters to get clarification than the content open colleges supplied. They mentioned on their information page that they help you get placements as it's a requirement for the course, so whe... Read moren I requested help for placements the answer I received from the person over the phone was 'we don't help you get placements, but instead you give us the names and contact information of the businesses you've been to who've rejected the placement request and we'll keep hassling them on your behalf until they let you in'. Great support, give my name a bad reputation, harass businesses and call that help. 
I lost my job and ended up in a pretty serious mental health state due to my mother receiving a cancer diagnosis so I decided it was in my best interest to withdraw form the course through the 'financial hardship and special considerations' pathway. In this option it states that you need a letter from you doctor describing the mental health issues you're having and why it's necessary for me to withdraw. I ended up getting THREE different medical certificates from my doctor, including the medications I was taking (incredibly violating to request that information) and each time they rejected the letters saying there wasn't enough detail and even suggesting that the letters were fraudulent. When I told the woman over the phone that the accusations and process was becoming so stressful that it was causing me to have suicidal thoughts she said 'that's not my problem'. Which yeah I get, it's not your problem, but have a heart. I had to pay for the whole course because opencolleges ignored my requests and barely responded or answers my calls unless I hounded them constantly.
Avoid avoid avoid! Go somewhere else, I still shocked they're running with the amount of bad reviews and lawsuits they've received. 
I've moved on from the experience and I'm happy and healthy, but I will always alert people about how terrible this place is."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-10-27T23:15:11.000Z,The experience is worthwhile,"Initially I was pretty overwhelmed with all the course content. But i came across the assessment walkthroughs that helped me put course theory into practical.The Diploma is amazing and I would recommend Open Colleges to anyone that is seeking to move ahead in their career progression or even seeking on job training. The online learning, although may seem daunting, is actually quite easy and very well supported by the trainers."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-10-27T03:52:09.000Z,Dishonest and not very upfront of cancelation fees. Unethical business practices. A big Trap to take your money,Disappointed and will never accept call from sale person (fake enrollment officer) to discuss about the cancellation and refund.  Before 3 months refund is load of crap.  Unethical business practices. First time to know this trashy business exist in Australia. After 8 days in the course they ask you to give 40% of course payment to exit according to their condition.
5 out of 5 stars,2022-10-26T03:11:15.000Z,What an experience!,"I cannot believe that I have just completed my first course in Australia. The road has been long but the feeling of completing it is so satisfying. I did this course because i wanted to pursue a career in community services and earn more money, but i have learned a lot about myself and others. My relationship with the people around me has improved because of this course. Thanks to my trainer Rosan who ensured that I understand each module through walkthroughs videos and audios, repetition and examples."

I did placement in 2 clinics, one used me for unpaid labour then fired me to hire a qualified nurse, and the other clinic hired me as a trainee vet nurse, stuck me on reception and banned me from accessing any equipment in the hospital area to do my assessment training. Then Covid hit and I could not find placement in another clinic. My course expired and by that stage I had lost so much confidence in ever finishing the course that I didn't pay the extension fee.. The student support was unhelpful and I had no support from the clinic I was in and it all felt impossible. 
I called today to try and resume where I left off and was informed that the course had been discontinued and I cannot complete it! What a waste of time and effort and such a waste of money. I am so disappointed and still unqualified and now cannot even finish the course!! I do not recommend this college at all. They'll take your money but are not invested in you completing the course at all. My feeling is they discontinued the Vet Nursing course because of the low completion rate."

For each and everything I had to call student support over and over again. Which was no help at all. Finding placement was such a challenge and zero support provided by the college. Choosing open colleges was such a waste of 2 years. I would not recommend it to any one. Please save you money and go Via Tafe if you can. All I had to do was pay for extension over extension.The study material was very basic. If I learned anything was via the placement... Read moreand from the support of my placement supervisor. 

Its been nearly over 3 weeks since I have submitted my portfolio and have no heard back regarding the certificate. I still have to keep contacting student support with no outcome.

Edit: After getting in touch with the team of open colleges from here, my issues was resolved within a day.
I would like to thanks to the person who speed up the process soon as I messaged them form here."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-09-05T05:37:13.000Z,Well Worth it.,The assistance I got from my Assessor was fantastic. She always responded to every question and concern and got me through the course.
4 out of 5 stars,2022-08-31T09:12:37.000Z,The beautiful experience to study through OC,The support i received fro OC was amazing and the trainers were fantastic. Everytime you have a question or anything cannot get through they have been there to support. For me being a mom of 3 kids and part time worker as a Carer to put myself through OC to achieve a Diploma is a mile stone and if you believe in yourself and put your mind to it. You can move the mountains easily. Rosan you have been the rock on mu studies. Thank you for all the support from the OC Team.

The feedback is helpful and it keeps you motivated in studying. From the beginning call you sign up, to submitting and getting my grades I have been very blessed with support. Tom and Nicole are so lovely."

1 out of 5 stars,2022-08-15T07:02:07.000Z,Poor customer service and delayed certificate,I have been waiting for my certificate for a long time now despite following up and no action (no one cares to replies emails). I was being told to check my junk mail as an excuse to delay the process. I could not talk to the person (Joshua) who was following my case because Rozelle didn't see the need for me to do that. Rozelle made sure I can't talk to anyone. I don't trust the college.
5 out of 5 stars,2022-08-09T04:21:27.000Z,Great experience,I was very satisfied with my overall experience with open collages the assessors were always helpful and replyed to my emails in a timely manner. The open collages portal is easy to use and has a sufficient amount of learning materials and walk throughs of each assessment. The course seemed a bit over whelming at first but i successfully completed the course with support from my assessor and other students.
5 out of 5 stars,2022-08-03T23:59:29.000Z,Great course to learn at your own pace,"The course wasn't difficult, you just need to put the hours in. I completed the modules in 3-months and completed the work placement in 4-weeks."

Thank you for making this process educational and relevant with up to date resources."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-07-31T20:31:31.000Z,DO Not go with Open Colleges,The course was repetitive on most questions. Some links didn’t work. Course content was good but there was one particular tutor who was setting you up to fail.If you did not meet satisfactory marks you had to PAY EXTRA TO RESUBMIT which they only stated after you sign up !!!
5 out of 5 stars,2022-07-27T02:36:41.000Z,Wonderful support from my assessor,"I commenced my Diploma in 2019 and have since experienced hurdles I did not expect in my personal life.I started placement in February 2022 and due to unforeseen personal circumstances had to delay it until June. Open Colleges have been nothing but supportive while I have been unable to study, and with the hurdles throughout placement- they have been very accommodating to issues I was having within my placement organization.My WPA assessment was much more relaxed, and less nerve racking than I thought it would be, my assessor provided me with a lot of information and extra knowledge for me to apply in further study and work."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-07-24T05:47:44.000Z,"Terrible company - Don't bother, go somewhere else!","I began my course during the first sets of lockdowns in Melbourne. Throughout my whole course I had only spoken to staff who were rude, unhelpful and inconsiderate. The staff never offered any solutions to the problems that I had raised. Due to the lockdowns, I was unable to complete the work placement. As they say need proof of trying, I provided this and they still neglected to help. I then had to extend my course under special consideration for this (after arguing with multiple people that I shouldn't have to pay extra each month as it was a... Read more pandemic and financial issues). It took me multiple times to submit this and still did not get a response. After calling them, I found out they didn't reply because I needed to submit an extra documentation to support the lockdowns impacting placement. Yes, no one replied because it needed more documentation, for around a month, even though multiple staff had seen the email. My course had expired in this time as well. This was not the first time I had not been responded to as well. I spoke to one of the girls there who had told me that, and told me the extra document I needed and said I would get a response within 2 business days. I asked her 3 times to give me an accurate answer of how long I will be waiting and she promised it would be 2 business days as it is now an active case. Of course I didn't believe her. It was also a long weekend and I understand some people work part-time or had the extra day off. So I ended up giving her over a week (personal things came up and I could not call before hand, but I did try to email). I ended up calling them when I got a spare minute and was greeted by a guy, who told me she wasn't working and asked what the situation was. This guy is the only helpful person in this entire company, managers included. He processed my whole special extension, and gave me an extra month on top of it within 10 minutes. So this girl had 2 weeks roughly to do what this guy did within 10 minutes. That girl is an accurate representation of all the staff and their work ethic (excluding this boy). I do have the names of all these staff, however I will not name them for privacy reasons. After trying for a while to find places for work placement and getting knocked back, simply due to being with Open Colleges, I was able to get my workplace to allow me to count my work towards work placement. I submitted my claim and was waiting for approval. I kept checking and asking for updates, and of course, no response. I knew my course extension was coming to an end (only had enough + a bit extra to cover work placement to begin with) and applied for special consideration for extra time again, as all i'm waiting for is the to approve the workplace. Well by time I submitted the special consideration, I was not longer able to do it there. So that month of me waiting could have been used to finish my work placement fully, instead of waiting. I had sent multiple emails (their student support call line was only open during my work times) and still no response. Finally the other day I was able to talk to someone on live chat as my course expired and I have been waiting weeks for a response, once again. Well they told me that they don't do anything about following up on work placement approvals, and that its up to the company you are doing it with to accept the one email they send that he said always goes to junk mail. Firstly, thats just lazy, but secondly, I had sent multiple questions asking about it and again, no one could tell me that?? so again, horrible, lazy work ethic. On the contrary, I also did ask my workplace, who had no idea about the email. I had also asked him for an update on my special extension, which he said they no longer do (which I believe he is lying or if he is not, goes into the horrible company) and yet again, no one told me this or anything during the time waiting for a response. I had asked him for a management contact details and he refused but told me they will be into contact with me, which was supposed to be after a few days. He also sent me a complaint form to fill out. Im still waiting for management to email me and yet I don't think they will honestly. So save your time and go somewhere else, even if it means paying more money. Because of the staff not wanting to communicate or do anything remotely helpful, I am not able to get my certificate and wasted my money here. Throughout everything I had been nice to them, but they don't care how nice or rude you are. Im not sure if these are the company's policies and procedures or a result of lazy work ethic, but either way, save your time, money and stress.

Also - It might say nationally recognised, but If you are looking to go into a government agency, I would look into if it is recognised as it is not in some states, even though it says it is. I was luckily enough to secure a position in a government role with no qualifications needed, however I cannot move up until I complete another diploma of the same course that is recognised to them or a Bachelor (currently now having to do!). A lot of other people have had this issue, so be careful."

1 out of 5 stars,2022-07-16T11:38:14.000Z,Avoid Open college,Their Marking is so behind. educators are resigning. when u emailed course coordinator. no reply. very bad system. should be reported to department of education. my cohort and other cohort are behind marking for 5 months. they dont care. just about money money money.
4 out of 5 stars,2022-07-13T06:43:55.000Z,A good flexible educational experience,"I originally signed up during the pandemic as I figured there was no better time to start then when forced to stay home and looking for where I wanted to move forward in life. Due to the nature of being online, you definitely need to be self dedicated and it is easy to loose motivation, but there are multiple avenues of support should it be required. Connecting with study buddies, booking in faculty phone calls etc. Throughout my course I have gained full time employment in a job I love. Very glad I found open colleges and this course."
4 out of 5 stars,2022-07-05T22:34:04.000Z,Support Staff,I completed my Diploma this year but needed support to get my RPL approved. The team went the extra mile to assist me in getting this process completed for which I am extremely thankful for.
1 out of 5 stars,2022-07-05T02:41:18.000Z,Never study through them again!,Not great collage and didn’t get much support at all. Basically did the whole thing on my own and I find I haven’t learnt very much at all. Having a deadline that needs extended but there not helping me so I can finish in time.
4 out of 5 stars,2022-06-30T05:08:15.000Z,A Good Educational Experience!,"It was initially hard to get started but the content was shown to be very relevant once I started my work placement, and the staff were always very helpful when I had questions or needed support."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-06-27T04:44:31.000Z,Upsetting,"I attempted to study with Open Colleges when I was 18 only to become homeless not long after and unable to continue study. I messaged my course advisor this and I never heard back from the College. I didn't get a refund (not that that's the principle) but he nor did anyone else contact me after this. That was it. Now at 24 and looking to study the course again, I will NOT go through Open Colleges."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-06-26T07:11:33.000Z,Course Review,"I found some of the content repetitive and there were a number of links that weren't working. Some of the questions in assignments were hard to decipher what was being asked, however the walkthroughs mostly helped to clarify these issues. Overall I was happy with the teaching - my assessor Rosan, was very accessible and got back to me quickly. He was supportive and encouraging when I was finding it hard to stay motivated. I didn't think the course was difficult."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-06-25T02:39:39.000Z,There isn’t a 0 stars option. Take the average review score and lower by 1,"Teaching resources were outdated and not always functional.The course shouldn’t have been difficult but was made more so by the lack of communication (phased out modules, only given days notice even if half way through), inability to ask assessors questions or feedback, when a question was answered (often weeks later) it was nonsensical or didn’t address the core query at all… or just plain wrong. It was a mess and while I obviously don’t recommend anyone enrol, I would actively try to convince people not to. Go to Tafe."
1 out of 5 stars,2022-06-19T02:45:57.000Z,Not a great experience,"I would not use Open Colleges again for an online course. Course content was out of date and insufficient to complete assignments. Large amounts of independent research was required. I found course trainers very difficult to engage with and mostly unhelpful. Assignments were very lengthy and very unclear in their requirements resulting in many resubmissions. I would have expected a lot more interaction with trainers to clarify subject matter and assignment requirements. I was told I would require 17 hours a week of work which I personally found... Read more insufficient, especially with the length of the assignments. Assignments are not graded as a percentage, you are graded as either being Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. This means that 98% of your assignment could be correct but a resubmission would be required for a small detail, and waiting a further 2 weeks to be re-graded. I feel that in such cases mere feedback to provide a better understanding of the topic would suffice."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-06-16T11:56:49.000Z,Extraordinary trainer/s and strong student support,"Through these years, I have been struggling to balance my study and lifestyle. Rosan Lal, my trainer and assessor, has not only supported me in the knowledge learning but he ignites my enthusiasm toward the study until I accomplished it. Rosan is a very approachable and skilful trainer. As a student who is from different cultural background, Rosan told me not to be self-abasement but be myself. Also, I found the walkthrough Rosan downloaded on additional resources very useful.Generally, I would recommend it to anyone who is planning to study community services courses in order to serve in the voluntary groups after graduation alongside strong student support and trainer/s."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-06-15T04:20:02.000Z,Fantastic service from teachers,"Chris was a fabulous teacher who gave so much of his time to me. I would 100% recommend open colleges to anyone who wants the flexibility of studying online, with a teacher who is there every step of the way."
3 out of 5 stars,2022-06-12T15:53:21.000Z,Was a challenging and self independent course,"I got my certificate they are not scammers Overall it went good and it was challenging, it gives you more time to submit your assessment.

1 out of 5 stars,2022-05-31T07:56:26.000Z,Zero support,I Waited 2 weeks for my phone orientation. No one ever called. The Course material is very repitetive and basic. I didn't find my teaching involved at all.The qualification at the end is good for nothing.Would not recommend Open Colleges.
1 out of 5 stars,2022-05-28T02:17:32.000Z,I am extremely dissatisfied. The communication between the support team and students are very slow.,Difficult due to personal circumstances and would prefer more recorded videos. From australian sources. I am a visual learner and would prefer the presenter showing recorded journal entries as an example rather than reading.
1 out of 5 stars,2022-05-25T21:11:27.000Z,Do not go near this place!,Make sure you read the fine print. They are only interested in your money. They have no integrity. Due to unforeseen circumstances it was impossible for me to complete the course. I had ample evidence of financial  and medical hardship. They ignored all of the evidence and I had to pay $4k for a $10k course that I had no access to. They are criminals.
1 out of 5 stars,2022-05-18T09:39:36.000Z,Not helpful,Wouldn't recommend studying through Open Colleges. Assessors don't check in on students or seem to have empathy. Emails to student support get ignored. Also paying for extensions per month is stupid.
4 out of 5 stars,2022-05-18T02:35:28.000Z,Helpful people and Good Support System,The course has been very interesting and helpful in my line of work. I have learned some key techniques and expertise in providing efficient service delivery. My Assessor has been very helpful and quick to respond to any questions and the support people have always been willing to help. Some aspects to the course are difficult but get easy once one understands.

2 out of 5 stars,2022-05-10T23:58:41.000Z,Overpriced and little support,"I paid over 2k to do a business administration course with OpenColleges, I got stuck on one module and didn't have access to the tool needed to complete the assignment, I did it using an alternative software but the tutor kept asking me to re-submit and I couldn't complete the rest of the course. There was not really any assistance offered. Waste of time and money."
5 out of 5 stars,2022-05-10T03:41:20.000Z,amazing extremely supportive,The teachers and assessors are amazing. The wording of the questions were sometimes hard to work out what direction to take and how to answer it and a bit overwhelming.

The support staff are really helpful and supportive every time I needed help. All the Trainers/Assessors have been really helpful from the beginning. Even though sometimes you don't get the answer right away, it always comes. I can't be thankful enough.

3 out of 5 stars,2022-04-13T01:37:36.000Z,Mostly the course was satisfactory.,Some of the assessments were open to interpretation which made it difficult.

When doing placement, the ""supervisor"" that was assigned to my wife was never the one that was contacting her during ""check-up calls"", etc. The supervisors that did contact her were not very helpful as they would say that they are not assigned to her and could not help.

There is more but not worth it. Just don't go with Open Colleges."

Open Colleges have an unfair cancellation policy where the full course fee IS the cancellation fee. I am starting this petition to hopefully help students who are having a similar experience to me and to protect future students from this experience. 

Students should be able to sign up with peace of mind that if life or hardship got in the way of study, they will be treated fairly and will be provided with correct information and clear procedure from the start. The policy should be fair, straightforward, and not misleading."

Open Colleges online support and my Assessor Rosan Lal, have kept me focused along the way to success. Three things got me through my studies: 1.

1 out of 5 stars,2022-03-10T23:18:13.000Z,Absolutely disgusting. Do not give these people your money!,"I began studying mid-Jan, moved past my cooling-off-period by 3wks, encountered personal and medical struggles, contacted special considerations team and I was treated so poorly throughout the entire process.  I sent through all the requested correspondence in support of my hardships, and was met with a cold, apathetic, generic email quoting terms and conditions, advising that I will be required to pay 50% of my course fees as a cancellation fee.  I then supplied more supportive evidence to appease Open College's special consideration criteria... Read moreand was again denied.  This was escalated to their complaints team (another form) and again, denied.  I then obtained more supportive documents from my doctor and the complaints team redirected me back to the Special Consideration team, who responded 'approving' my enrollment cancellation but quoting my cancellation fee again, and then a separate email requesting my banking details.  I called student services, who were very empathetic and agreed that this treatment was unacceptable (unfortunately these are not the people making decisions), but I was told that this matter was above them and I needed to complete the internal appeals process.  So to recap; student struggling physically, emotionally and financially -> special consideration form -> complaints form -> another special consideration form -> an appeals form (and if unsuccessful) -> ACCC or ombudsman complaint process.  Absolute joke!  They will continue to pass very offensive back-handed judgement on your medical conditions they whole way.
If you want to study but are 100% certain you will not come into contact with any personal, medical, mental health, or financial struggles - they might be alright.  
In my professional (HR & business experienced) opinion, a business that has such tight legal recovery processes with stringent criteria for support or exit strategies where cancellation charges are extravagant, and the expectation to scrutinise your extenuating personal circumstances, leaving you vulnerable to their discretion, there is a reason they have had to create these processes to protect their corporate ass as much as possible, and that reason is not in favour of the greater good. leave you with nothing but regret."

It was only after I threaten them with ACCC and ASQA that I received my certificate after two weeks, no excuses in sight.  I will never study with them again and I will never recommend them to anyone.

I have received my certificate.  There's nothing OC to do for me now,  I'm just writing a review to express my unhappiness with them and to let other potential students know what kind of services you are offering."

The 'assessors' are overpaid and don't properly review your work - they skim it and resend old feedback even with the changes you have made. They also are no help when you reach out to them. I explained to one assessor that their feedback didn't make any sense to me and asked for them to explain pieces in a different way - the teacher a [Name Removed], said his explanations were clear and long so they should make sense. That's poor teaching - if a student cannot understand and you refuse to reexplain it, how good of a teacher are you? They also take frequent leave periods with no notice to allow you to have work submitted with reasonable time."

Read more I also want to extend my appreciation to the faculty and student support for their understanding during these difficult times due to the virus and the issues it was causing in regards to delays in completing my course and to finding a suitable place to finish my course practical.
Even though the course was in-depth it gave me a better knowledge base and understanding plus prepared me for my role as a dental assistant. The only negative I can find with the course is the lag time between submitting work and getting feedback on what I needed to correct, or if I could start another section of my course sometimes a month would go by without any feedback at all.
The one big positive as English is not my first language was my teachers ability to be able to keep things simple for me when she was explaining what I needed to do or what was required by me, once again thank you teacher Darina, you made the course more pleasurable and an easier learning experience.
A big thank you to the faculty and student support for also allowing me to extend several times as without these extensions I would also have not of been able to complete the course due to the virus and my workload at the dental clinic.
As a final comment if anyone wants to learn every aspect of being a dental assistant then this course definitely prepares you for it and thank you to the college for that."

Simple things like - write your responses on the assessment page then upload instead of wiring as a separate word document. Also, the course materials sometimes I print out for future record and would love if the notes were numbered. Also an outline of what is expected of us regarding referencing before course begins.

1 out of 5 stars,2021-11-02T07:15:41.000Z,Warning...read me.,"If you are considering applying to Open Colleges, I would please urge you to take the time to read my review.I have been a student at Open Colleges, I have completed a Diploma of Community Services and Certificate IV in Disability; I have also been to a reputable education provider (the University of Technology Sydney - where I completed a Bachelor of Nursing with Distinction).The Staff are very happy to accept you into their courses, they are more than happy to accept payments for courses also. However, when you are enrolled the course coo... Read morerdinators or lecturers (if you can call them that) rarely respond in a timely manor. Combined with this the learning content is very vague, there is no prescribed textbook, I rarely saw material referenced which made me do some digging whereby I found a majority of their data was and if not all was taken from Aspire manuals whereby they have bastardised or re-written it for the most part to suit their needs (very poorly and might I add the Aspire manuals give greater depth and learning than their Open College counterparts).

Much if not all of that information that is conveyed to students will be required to be responded via many links and comments sections throughout the content; this learning is further consolidated through assessments, these assessments are a combination of both quizzes and written assignments - they do not allow any margin of error which has led to many of my quizzes - causing a 24 hour lock out to repeat quizzes; assignments - taking weeks to mark, should errors be identified assessors provide very limited or basic feedback (that often left me more confused than it being marked prior). I thought it would also be prudent to mention here that Open Colleges has recently introduced a $30 fee for remarking assessments - which is ridiculous considering they have already been paid as part of the purchase price for the course in the first place.

This brings me to the work placement components...I have had many conflicts with Open Colleges in the past, they have refused to recognise work place learning (when I have worked in Nursing/Disability), they have workplace portfolios that are very very large that take an enormous amount of time to complete, the workplace portfolios often are sent backwards and forwards to students - due to errors that can take months to complete. Work placements are required to be located by students, this is a cause for great distress for many students there are many forums that exist whereby students have all but given up on finding a placement, which begs me to question - if they have already had a number of students that have completed their qualifications...would they not have a list of workplaces that students could contact, alas no this is not the case; I can attest to this fact having being enrolled in another two Open Colleges courses: Certificate IV in Youth Work along with the Certificate IV in Alcohol and Other Drugs/Certificate IV in Mental Health - both that ""disappeared off my profile"" and subsequently told by Open Colleges that my work was for nothing following not completing the course within their timeframe - Yes, Open Colleges, this is due to the vast proportion of Australian businesses that refuse to admit your students to their workplaces; this does not come at a surprise considering much of the content is basically re-written from an Aspire manual and has little to no referred or referenced source for the location of the content and where it is coming from."

The Assessors and Student Support was great with support and assistance during my study time and they do explain each Module in the Webinar's.

The material itself is all theory with minimal interactive learning activities. You do not hear from open college and reaching for support is minimal. Just the generic responses. Some assessors take up to 2 weeks to mark your assessments. The assessments contain questions that are not clear. The assessments also contain multiple components that can take up to weeks to do.... Read more Also they make you resubmit the entire assessment if you miss out on a tiny little part that is technically irrelevant. 

I've now had to request to extend my course and each time I have to extend month by month and waiting for approval. Are you kidding me? I am paying for it. Ridiculous. They don't take into consideration you working full time and that you are experiencing a pandemic in VIC (longest lockdown in the world!) and that may take a toll on your mental health and so there may be a lack in motivation to study. Instead they request for a doc certificate. I'm an adult and understand my responsibilities, however I signed up without anticipating a pandemic. My advice would be to take into consideration your time. If you work full-time, this may not be the right course or academic avenue. Also if you are more of a hands on learner then definitely not. I am now aiming to get this diploma and get the hell out of here."

Read morerse, they give you an opportunity to re-do and to test your understanding.  Long-distance study is a challenge in itself, the self-discipline to keep your study time intact, away from work and from family demands can be, at times, overwhelming. But Open Colleges offered help, tools, suggestions, and guidance and I'm very grateful for that. I also had to suspend my studies at one point in order to meet work demands outside my regular hours of work and to extend it a couple of times when I fell behind and I had nothing but support to do that.  The not-so-good points: the only things I could point here is that at times some links to references were broken and some spelling mistakes. However, they were far too few of them to stop anyone from understanding the context of the articles and nothing to stop you from Googling it yourself nor asking the teacher to clarify it if it came to that.
I loved this course and I fully recommend it if you want an entry point into the digital world!"

I had troubles claiming the Covid Disaster Payment from Centrelink so I basically had no way of paying my course.I first emailed the consultant who enrolled me into the course, asking how can I discontinue my course.

She mentioned she couldn’t do anything on her end but had mentioned that I could apply for special consideration with documentation as proof. 

I filled out the form, I made it clear I had received no shifts by providing my rosters for the past 3 weeks since my enrolment, due to the lockdown in my state. I also included a screenshot of my manager texting me saying my shift was cancelled the day before of my shift - with the date and time shown. I mentioned I didn’t want any refund and to cancel without any fee. However, the person who was handling my case had no sympathy at all. He said I would still need to pay the remaining fee of $1817.20. The only options I was given was to pay $60 a fortnight or defer paying this off for 2 months. Apparently loss of work hours or termination of employment is not a reasonable excuse - even during the tough times that we are in. 

I haven’t even completed any parts of the course. I don’t understand how they still expect me to pay that amount when I have no shifts because of this Covid lockdown."

The information given by the assessors when you hand it up is never useful and the assignments themselves are written poorly so it's easy to make mistakes. Technical issues go with the online experience as well so this just adds to the problem. We are currently in a pandemic so money is a problem for everyone, so I can't see how they could think it's acceptable to start charging people money for simply making mistakes. We are here to learn not pay."

2 out of 5 stars,2021-07-19T23:25:05.000Z,Lack of support,The questions for the assessments are worded poorly and most don’t make much sense. The course material is made up of a lot of external links that don’t work. I spoke with other students that were having the same problems too. It takes 3-7 days for tutors and assessors to reply to questions regarding the assessments and the answers are usually just as poorly worded.

I have decided that I will probably have to change my phone number now, as much as I don’t want to and shouldn’t have to, because I have no idea who to report them to. I am sick of being constantly violated, so I see no other option."

1 out of 5 stars,2021-07-08T07:42:47.000Z,Money Focused,"I signed up in early 2019 during what I now know as a manic episode. I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in mid 2019 and my main priority and focus was on myself and making sure I was seeking professional help. I was completely unaware of my mental illness and it wasn’t until a psychosis episode that I realised it was something beyond my control. Discontinuing the course was the last thing on my mind. I emailed and asked for special consideration and asked for a full or partial refund however, I was told that because the cooling of... Read moref period had passed, I am not able to get a refund. So I provided documents to prove my diagnosis and psychiatrist and psychologist appointments to proof that this is in fact, a circumstance that is well beyond my control. I signed up unaware of my mental illness but they do not see it in that light unfortunately. Money has been an issue because of covid-19 but I guess open colleges don’t care about the wellbeing of anyone. They honestly do not care about anything except for their bank account.

If I could go back, I would advise myself to not sign up however, I can’t. So please DO NOT sign up to ANY courses with open colleges. They are only in it for the money and have no sympathy. If open colleges was a person, they would be ‘Karens.’ Please please please do not even consider signing up to any courses with them!!"

I have gotten to the point that I am creating a case with consumer affairs to take this further...So take it from me don't go through them"
1 out of 5 stars,2021-07-06T08:59:37.000Z,A brothel has more integrity.,It takes 3 to 4 weeks for a single assessment to be marked after emails requesting why. You are left on your own with no actual support. Qld business do not like this establishment as they are unprofessional and ask for to much paperwork that is not industry focused.They drag out marking assignments so you are forced to pay for extensions. If you reside in QLD you are made to look for your own work placement and when they fail to give you information do not let your job placement contact them other wise open colleges will ask for $1500 for organising work placement!!!! The biggest white collar crime going when it comes education….
1 out of 5 stars,2021-07-02T03:26:27.000Z,they do not rate  re scammers,"Absolutely hopeless.  not sure the course was even accredited.Went to Resolution Institute as Open Colleges say they are a member. What a lie. Did not even respond.They fail to answer any enquiries give out dodgy contracts, courses are not even the correct ones enrolled in, refuse to cancel a course, refuse to give information about fees , just send you to a debt collector. Only interested in money however scam way they can get it. Do not give details to these people. They do not provide what they advertise and cannot be trusted. NO STARS They need to be exposed."
1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-17T06:26:56.000Z,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,"Awful awful terrible a complete joke! No help whatsoever, WAY too much work, nothing but constant stress and inability to complete the massive amount of unhelpful and useless tasks. Halfway through the course they suddenly decide they can start charging $30 per incorrect question!!! Thanks for wasting our time and money, these guys needs to be shut down."
1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-16T02:41:53.000Z,Terrible. Waste of money. Do not bother.,"I contacted Open Colleges a year ago to ask about the Cert IV and Diploma in HR. I haven't studied in over 20 years and have only worked in general admin roles. I wanted to broaden my career skills and have always had an interest in the HR world. I discussed with my ""consultant"" what would be more beneficial for me in regards to obtaining work once I completed, we discussed at length my previous education and work experience and I was advised that the diploma would be best suited to me and that my 20+ years of doing administrative roles would b... Read moree enough for me to not only take on the diploma without any worries but pass quite easily. 
I shared my concerns about this as I was unsure that I would be able to take on the diploma but I was comforted and reassured by the consultant that it wouldn't be too hard and that the course content was similar to the Cert IV. This phone call and subsequent calls after to organise payment and the signing of the contract left me feeling on top of the world and that I could achieve the outcome I had hoped for.

Fast forward a year and it has done nothing but caused me anxiety, stress, financial loss, is well above my knowledge and extremely difficult to complete. 

The course content is quite frankly boring, hard to follow and is very disconnected to what is required in the assessments. 
First assessment is to put together a HR strategy for your fake company. The information available to you regarding strategies is 1 page. You are required to do your own external research in this subject. Creating such a complex document without any understanding of business strategies makes it hard to complete. The answers to my questions from my assessor are cut and paste, which I was afraid of as I noticed that pattern on the discussion page when I first started and honestly it put me off requesting help. 

I have struggled to understand what I am meant to do. There is only minimal information available through open colleges with the majority of my learning being through my own google searches and using what small information is available through AHRI. There are alot of links to external sites with ""recommended reading"" which end up being articles up to 500 pages long, links to YouTube videos for lectures from a German University lecturer that are over 3 hours long, hard to understand and you cannot hear the questions the students ask, only the answer."
1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-11T04:53:41.000Z,Wish I had read reviews prior to signing up,"I have been completing the Certificate IV in accounting.1. The content is poorly structured and quite random2. The levels of support are absolutely despicable - it has taken a whole week for an assessor to answer some basic questions so I can complete my exercises.3. Concepts aren't throughly explained, almost like there are explanations or more context missing.In a nutshell, its an unintelligent educational provider - I don't recommend."
1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-04T03:47:09.000Z,I wish I read the reviews about Open Colleges,Once you sign on the dotted line to pay them money you will get automated emails to 'encourage' you to study. None to find out why nothing is progressing on.
1 out of 5 stars,2021-06-02T06:33:53.000Z,Stay away from this school and save your money.,"Save your money, energy and sanity and stay clear from this school. They lack compassion and customer service. The course structure in the diploma of business is appalling and teachers give you robotic copy and paste answers when it comes to feedback. I applied for special consideration due to a medical condition I have that is making me go blind and asked for 6 months. They only gave me 3 months and told me to ""make progression"" great thing to say to someone thats going blind? Erin was extremely rude and insensitive. Wish I had read the google reviews before enrolling and paying for this course."
2 out of 5 stars,2021-05-31T04:24:30.000Z,Not worth it!,The course content was very disappointing.   Incredibly basic and not at all engaging. The support from teaching staff was non existent.I regret my decision to enrol. I applied to withdraw under their ‘special consideration’ due to financial hardship and medical issues but was still expected to pay $3000 despite completing on 3% of the course.
1 out of 5 stars,2021-05-28T05:43:20.000Z,a 10k email,"I wanted to get a diploma to gain more qualifications, being full time employed i thought open colleges was a good idea. (spoiler alert - it wasn't)To do the course i wanted to do i had to enroll in a second one on top costing me about $10.000 in total. For that price all i got was an email with log in details. Being a foreigner the study system was confusing but i tried my first module. Quiet quickly I hit a pump and had no help provided but couldn't continue without it. So i dropped out, realizing studying online on my own is not right for m... Read moree. Fast forward, i am now unemployed without government help (aka completely broke) but open colleges still wants me to pay off that huge amount outstanding without taking in consideration that i dropped out/ never actually done any part of the courses. So they expect me to pay 10k for a single email.. i understand that you commit to something and have to pay for it (like a loan) so i asked if i could at least use the payments towards a different course (as i the one i enrolled doesn't exist any longer) but it's not transferrable. 
Moral of story, save your money unless you will need absolutely no support and are ready to put in more work for a Cert3 than a uni degree."
