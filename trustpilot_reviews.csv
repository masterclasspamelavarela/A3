1,2023-03-29T04:41:01.000Z,I believe this place is a scam,I believe this place is a scam. I canceled the course with them within the 7 day cooling period and was told that the course was canceled. 6 weeks later they have taken $330 out of my account and still counting. I have called 5 times only to sit on hold for over an hour and have someone tell me that the money would be refunded. This has not been the case. Today was the 5th call with someone telling me the same story. Stay far far away from this place.
1,2023-04-03T02:28:06.000Z,"BIG SCAM don‚Äôt ever enrol with open colleges you not gonna ,you will lose your time ,energy and money for nothing","Since I‚Äôm still in the same situation nothing has changed.don‚Äôt ever enrol with open colleges you not gonna ,you will lose your time ,energy and money for nothingI have called Open Colleges over 20times by email and phone call ,there are canceling all appointments scheduled all at least all my online courses are closed without possibility to reopened without educator assessment . Educator not professional,This institution just wants your money .NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY MANY BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THEM , it should be shared with a lot of people to avoid falling into the trap. SO I WILL MAKE VIDEOS ABOUT THEMAlmost 11months that I am with open college and too much delay, too much injustice, in the process motivation of the students, have completed the modules  and  still waiting teachers to review my modules to let me  completed the work placement ,there is not following close with student ,they do everything to put the students very very low, very unfair. despite the calls, etc...conversation it gets worse and worse.Majority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist and teachers don‚Äôt care about it ,even you try to explain that the link are not working anymore.Teachers putting not satisfactory every second paragraph even I  try my best . They booked me appointment for teacher training finally canceled it without raison and confirmation, they are not care about studentsCustomer service are speaking not really correctly and are not understandingwhat is sure I will talk about open college a lot so that ,avoids people  to fall in the trap.I‚Äôm still waiting for how long ????You cannot do your job properly as a training center ?"
1,2023-03-06T07:04:18.000Z,If I could give zero stars for Open‚Ä¶,"If I could give zero stars for Open Colleges then I would. I wish I had done my research before studying online with them. Terrible product all round, if I started trying to list all the things wrong I would never stop. Please please please if you are considering using them don't."
1,2023-03-03T06:16:30.000Z,Zero star!!!!,"I have been studying diploma with Open colleges and I regretted that I chose Open colleges. I don`t even want to give them a star. They have recently changed the platform and I was hoping it would be better but it`s getting worse. I won`t get any support and when I try to chat with someone for support, the student support is never available. I wish I could get the money back. I will never recommend Open Colleges to anyone. It is waste of money and time!"
1,2023-03-03T00:56:14.000Z,Choosing Open college for study is the‚Ä¶,"Choosing Open college for study is the biggest and worst mistake of my career. I will not recommend open college to anybody. No support at all from student support, they won't reply back to yours emails and they do not care if you are struggling . When you enquire about course they say they will help you to find placement but they don't. After your fee is paid you are on your own in the middle of sea ."
2,2023-02-28T01:24:36.000Z,Used to be ok now a 0,"The only time it is easy to get through to open colleges is when you are signing up and paying money.  Good luck getting help.  There is no communication between assessors and students.  No feedback on assessments when you eventually get them back.  The new OSX has taken any ability to communicate and get help away.  They don't listen and act on complaints.  I contacted 60 minutes and a couple of other news shows, hopefully they will report on all of the bad service."
1,2023-02-22T04:45:51.000Z,They‚Äôre taking longer to mark then it took me to do the work,"I‚Äôm still waiting for them to complete my marking, they didn‚Äôt start until I had everything completed which took me 2 months to complete and it‚Äôs been 5 months now since I submitted my last assignment and they still are not finished, they had to give me 2 extensions so far of 3 months to accommodate how slow they‚Äôre marking process is, which doesn‚Äôt fully compensate the time wasted for what is supposed to be a 10 working day‚Äôs process. I‚Äôm being left short on time to complete my need work placement and which I planned to have extra time to complete so I could do my placement where I wanted but due to the delays it looks like that will be unlikely to happen now."
1,2023-01-25T09:31:45.000Z,The most racist college in Australia,"The most racist college in Australia, if asian students have completed 77% assignment, they don't get chance to go for final placement but Aussie do get chance even if they have completed less than 50% . The tutors always target asian students."
5,2022-12-21T23:01:21.000Z,Great,"I completed my diploma in leadership and management with a young family and stressful job.  Work at your own pace with the option of extending the time if the course is complete within the 2 years.Positive -Very helpful assessors.Work at your own pace.Helpful tips and video's on each project/assignment.Option to extend course time.Negative -When the new course changed over in April, the tips and videos were not made.Overall I was very happy with the structure by open colleges. Mostly easy to understand criteria and great support from all assessors. Will highly recommend to friends and colleagues."
1,2022-11-02T13:57:33.000Z,Disappointed,"I was only online using the course for 3 months. I have not been back on since December last year, which they have access to.After weeks of attempting to cancel the course due to extreme personal circumstances. I was finally permitted to end the course. But have now been charged a fee of $6587 to exit. Absolute greed mungers ... Do not sign up !!!"
5,2022-10-19T09:54:53.000Z,My experience with completing my diploma in community services,I was concerned when starting a course online I was worried I wouldn't get the support I needed. This definitely isn't the case with opencolleges I can't recommend them enough you will get the support you need and all very friendly. I was worried when starting my diploma in community services that I would have the time to study with 3 young children but I did it easy with in a year and a half. Very happyüòÅ
1,2022-10-20T10:14:25.000Z,If I could rate less I would,If I could rate less I would. Run the other way! They don‚Äôt help with placements and even if you are experiencing financial hardship and provide all the necessary documents they deny you and send you to the debt collectors. Course work is outdated and student support is none existent. Study anywhere else!There needs to be a class action against these thieves
1,2022-10-10T08:10:49.000Z,Wouldn't recommend,Wouldn't recommend studying through Open Colleges. Assessors don't check in on students and offer limited assistance. Emails to student support are ignored. The assistance they say they offer on their website aren't followed through/true. Seems as if they prefer to let their students struggle so they receive more money (extension fees).Do yourself a favour and study online elsewhere.
1,2022-10-11T08:07:05.000Z,If I could give less of a rating I‚Ä¶,"If I could give less of a rating I would, i do not recommend these fraudsters. My girlfriend cancelled her inrolement in a course and they still billed us for not cancelling in time even though will rang them in time before the cut off date. Now they are trying to milk us for money saying will still have overdue payments. Teachers don't care about their students passing just trying to milk payments. Courses are old and not up to date. They are nothing but scammers."
5,2022-08-30T06:18:39.000Z,I had a great experience with Open‚Ä¶,"I had a great experience with Open Colleges. The online learning experience was easy for me to navigate through and I received great support from the assessors and online help.I appreciated the feedback and guidance.I will definitely be coming back to do further training and study through them as its made it easy for me to balance single parenting, studying and working."
4,2022-10-04T09:52:12.000Z,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was very satisfied with the assortment of topics covered in the Community Services Diploma and it provided a good overview of the industry. I would recommend they add additional information regarding law proceedings (which many community members face) but there was a plethora of information specific to counselling methods. Start early on applying for Work Placement, left mine till the last minute and it was stressful. Very good assessment walk through recordings by the teaching team so it didn't feel as overwhelming."
1,2022-08-18T10:20:06.000Z,Awful services.,I have been waiting for my certificate for a long time now despite following up and no action (no one cares to replies emails). I was being told to check my junk mail as an excuse to delay the process. I could not talk to the person (Joshua) who was following my case because Rozelle didn't see the need for me to do that. Rozelle made sure I can't talk to anyone. I don't trust the college.
1,2022-09-07T12:13:16.000Z,They are horrible. DON'T USE THEIR COMPANY.,They are horrible. Meticulous and nit-picky. They take forever to respond to and mark assignments and they charge you (50$) to re-submit) if you fail 3x which you will. Even using the marking key as a guide you will still receive it back. They don't want you to succeed and make it incredibly difficult to do so.
5,2022-08-03T05:47:45.000Z,Diploma of Community Services - Great Experience,"The resources and online help were educational, relevant and up to date.  The user platform and modules were easy to navigate and very helpful too.  Video assessment walkthroughs were great as was the weekly 'ask anything' session with trainer (as well as response times when emailing trainer or help desk).  Recommend for anyone serious about this field."
1,2022-07-06T06:04:14.000Z,STAY AWAY,"I started this course as it was meant to be generic to fit any industry they said, well that was rubbish. The course content was poorly developed, the content was not relevant and when trying to explain this to them they didn't even want to listen.I am now going to be over 4K out of pocket and i have only done two models.Stay well away from OC, I wish I had read some of these reviews before signing up."
4,2022-06-30T07:07:52.000Z,Very pleased to have completed this course,"I did find it hard to be self motivated - in hindsight it would have been good to have a study buddy. Overall I found that when I reached out for help the staff were very supportive. The content became much more interesting as I started my work placement. And as hoped, I got a job where I did my work placement! Very pleased and proud of myself for getting to the end!"
1,2023-01-13T09:14:02.000Z,False information,"I was taking like a quiz thing to see what my future job could be since I‚Äôm curious, they said it would only take 5MINS and it took me forever and I didn‚Äôt even get results!!"
1,2022-06-02T02:25:39.000Z,If I could give them zero stars I‚Ä¶,"If I could give them zero stars I would. If you become sick and have to stop the course, you get charged a very large amount. They have a tiered system so depending on when you have to cancel you get charged more and more. Their policies punish you for your health, something no one can control. Be careful with this company, they are money hungry and don‚Äôt care that actual humans are trying to study."
1,2022-09-22T03:53:08.000Z,What a scam don't waste your time and money,"The assessments are very unfairly marked, and then you will be asked to pay a fee to resubmit. Some of the course content is over a decade old and is no longer relevant at all. The majority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist. There are spelling mistakes in every second paragraph, they did not even bother to run a spell check before publishing the course. Student support is close to non-existent, you will be waiting several weeks for a reply to an inquiry. This organisation only cares about attempting to milk as much money as they possibly can from students."
5,2022-05-12T09:06:28.000Z,Open Colleges - Diploma Community Services,"The assessors have been incredible, flexibility (extension approved) was really important to me as I have been able to work fulltime and study part time successfully. Content and online learning material was great and I found the final observation / assessment in module 9 (2.5hrs) to be insightful and enjoyable. I will be furthering my studies  (Psychology) but would highly recommend Open Colleges."

I have submitted supporting focuments and after that hot two emails suggesti g O should apply for extention which I did more than once.When I tried to submit a review on there website it didnt allow me u less I di mediation first. The other option was enabled. This is more than two months ago that I requested."
5,2022-04-22T09:25:05.423Z,During doing my course with open‚Ä¶,"During doing my course with open colleges, I had a good experience because I had a fantastic assessor Rosan Lal who is always helpful whenever I needed help or have questions. Plus it is a online course which I like most as I work full time and wouldn't be able to attend classes.So thank you Rosan and other staffs who helped as well."
5,2022-02-23T04:46:41.000Z,stressed for no reason!,"I was so stressed that I didnt sleep all night! In the end I had nothing to worry about, Rosan made me feel at ease and it ended up being a very positive experience. He is highly qualified, his feedback was amazing, I feel lucky to have had this last assessment process with Rosan, it felt relaxed and incredibly informative. All in all I had a great morning and I am so excited to have finialised it."
1,2022-06-17T06:18:43.000Z,Unreasonable!!,"Work load is excessive, trainers are rude and they take peoples money by using ""policy"". No matter what your reason is, they genuinely don't care. Its a warning, please be prepared to pay regardless of your circumstance cause they literally have a special considerations section for nothing."
1,2022-11-07T06:59:37.000Z,I wouldn't recommend at all,"I wouldn't recommend at all. Waste of money. I faced health problem and try to contact them to looking for help and option for me to keep studying or change course. They simple don't care, they treat you as nothing."
1,2021-11-22T22:00:54.000Z,Do not attend open colleges I tried to‚Ä¶,Do not attend open colleges I tried to cancel my diploma because of an injury and they rejected my special circumstances they don‚Äôt want to accept special circumstances even though they say they offer it just so they can still claim 1/3 of the course I have a drs certificate and they have sent me to a creditor and I still have to pay 4 thousand DO NOT TRUST THIS COLLEGE
1,2021-11-03T23:07:20.000Z,Bad experience‚Ä¶,"I had a bad experience with OC and had to renew my contract with work placement of over 120 hours for a Certificate 3 in early childhood care and education. It ended up being 180 hours of work. Open college are bad in mathematics a well. I completed 75 % of my studies. However, my certificate of attainment only recorded 25 %. Policies need to be revised, they may be over a 100 years old."
5,2021-09-06T03:13:28.000Z,I started my Diploma in community last year and was able to finish the course in less than a year,"I started my Diploma in community service last year and during my first conference meeting I was so confused as i have never studied online before. I didn't have a study buddy but with the assessment walkthrough it was so easy for me to get along my studies. My finall Assessor Rosan was so patient with me, made the entire process enjoyable. I am happy I choose open college."
1,2021-08-18T05:55:30.000Z,Did not provide course materials after full payment,"Very hard to deal with.  I am halfway through my course and they would not unlock my modules unless I pay for the full amount. After I paid for my full amount, they denied access to the modules because they said my course expired.  I am currently reporting them to the ombudsman, department of education and consumer of affairs.  Not fair that I am denied access to the materials that I paid in full."
5,2021-09-01T02:38:00.000Z,Had a very good experience,"Had a very good experience with Open College, would definitely join again for future certifications. Assesses are very easy to communicate and approachable specially Tanya Galey and Holly. Very friendly and understanding. Was little disappointed when I read the news about how Open college will charge extra fees after your second submission of each assessment for markings."
1,2021-10-27T22:33:28.000Z,Open Colleges do not act with integrity,"Open Colleges do not honour their agreement and only act in their own interest rather than the student/consumer. They breach their contractual obligations but wont allow you to break yours. They are unfair, have no compassion and are all about the money. There are so many educational providers - please chose them. Open Colleges are the worst !"
5,2021-07-29T07:08:45.000Z,Highly recommend!!,Open collages has been amazing to study through! Where i live didnt offer the course face to face so i had to go online (not my prefered method of study) but the trainers were amazing and super helpfull as was student support. They are understamding when life sometimes gets in the way and help you in whatever way they can! I would most definitely study through them again if i needed to! Highly reccomend
5,2021-07-27T02:35:26.000Z,All in all it was a great experience,"All in all it was a great experience, maybe l should have completed Cert 4 Community Services, before doing my Diploma.I found Rosan Lai wonderful and very helpful.I suggest to any one starting watch the webinars provided and attend module webinars they are really helpful.I wish they were their 2/12 years ago, you will find all the trainers, staff, staff support wonderful, l sure did."
5,2021-08-30T00:19:34.000Z,Really enjoyed my course in Marketing &‚Ä¶,"Really enjoyed my course in Marketing & Communications. I work in Marketing and I found all the information really beneficial to not only my day job but also  further enhanced my hard skills.  All the assessors, were so helpful and gave tangible feedback. My favourite assessor was Catherine Tumelty, she was warm and encouraging and provided valuable feedback."
5,2021-09-05T23:53:03.000Z,Excellent Photography and Photo Imaging Course,"I thoroughly enjoyed completing this online course at my own pace.  The support and guidance from the trainee, Sarah, was exceptional. Her feedback was professional and really helped with developing my knowledge, skills and confidence. The course content was thorough, interesting and covered many areas of photography. It was great! Thank you Open Colleges!"
5,2021-08-13T22:21:16.000Z,My Experience with Open Colleges,"My experience with Open Colleges has been amazing. I studied for my Diploma of Community Services. The course was challenging, but I learnt so much. I received amazing support and assistance from my assessor and student support whenever I required it. This has inspired me to consider doing further studies in the near future. I cannot thank Open Colleges enough."
1,2022-01-19T21:11:23.000Z,Beware.,"The level of support, although promised to be excellent, was rubbish. Many students were complaining that work hadnt been marked and returned. Having to wait for returned assessments before the next unit was ""unlocked"" makes the course longer. If you don't finish in time, you pay extra. Trying to withdraw from the course without paying out the full fees is near to impossible no matter your reasons. Luckily I had a solicitor and my repayment was reduced. People I've met say they're criminals! Beware."
5,2021-07-17T10:06:42.000Z,Very satisfied,This was the second time that I had chosen to complete a course with Open Colleges. I found the experience to be fantastic all of the support I needed was on hand. I found the feedback from each assessment to be clear and helpful. If I ever decide to continue studies in the future I would choose open colleges again. Thank You all so much for the experience and support.
5,2021-09-23T21:28:21.000Z,Cert IV in Ageing Support,"I enrolled in the Cert IV in Ageing Support. The course content was outstanding - very thorough- and the platform extremely user friendly, which is very important for on-line courses. My assessor was very experienced in the industry and very professional. Open Colleges maybe a bit more expensive than other on-line platforms, but well worth it."
5,2021-11-02T04:51:20.000Z,I find this college is excellent in education and training,"I find this college is excellent in teaching and educating students on the ways of the world and reality pertaining to the course area they choose to study. They have been very reasonable and accommodating with me, but firm, but fair. I believe this experience has been the best learning one so far and placement was an opportunity to learn, grow and implement into practice on a practical level. I highly recommend this institute to further your education and career prospects!"

The team specifically trainers and student support have been extremely helpful in every step of the way. The course content is quite extensive and enough material to use and refer back to. The quizzes and assessments at the end of each of the core modules has helped me a lot to summarize the overall learning.
5,2021-08-23T06:55:29.000Z,Amazing trainers and support staff,"The trainers and support staff are amazing.  Any query I had was responded to quickly and accurately.  The trainer who supervised my final live assessments was incredible.  Michelle was knowledgeable, friendly, encouraging and very reassuring.  I am very glad to have completed this course through Open Colleges and would recommend it to anyone."

Open Colleges wouldn‚Äôt allow me to extend my course but where quick to take my money. I would never recommend Open Colleges to anyone. Regret ever joining

The training material is generally helpful but not all are up to day. Some assessment questions are confusing. I can see the platform is progressing and improving. Overall experience is not easy but they help me to get there in the end. And they value feedbacks which is good.

They gave me fruitful feedbacks and encouragement along the way. I really do learnt a lot from them. I cannot finish my studies without their help.I will definitely recommend (10/10) Open Colleges to my families and friends.From the bottom of my heart, ThANK you so much!"
5,2021-06-24T01:48:53.000Z,I really enjoyed studying with Open‚Ä¶,I really enjoyed studying with Open Colleges.I found the Trainers and Assessors went above and beyond on multiple occasions which exceeded my expectations a wonderful experience all round.I would encourage reaching out to get a study buddy as TA Webb said ‚ÄòA burden shared is a burden halved‚ÄôI would definitely recommend studying with Open Colleges to anyone thinking of taking on studying as a career change or to further education.5 out of 5
3,2021-06-23T23:43:13.000Z,Unsatisfactory,"Overall the content was satisfactory although certain modules weren‚Äôt yet developed so i was waiting with no study for MONTHS to complete the course. This ultimately gave me a lack of motivation & loss of study drive. Not all trainers are helpful, only one actually replied to me regularly the others disregarded my messages. These few things are unacceptable when undertaking a course and this has lead me to not recommend open colleges to others."
1,2022-11-30T09:25:16.000Z,Don‚Äôt waste your money here,"They are great when they wanna sign you up then after that they don‚Äôt have time for you. So many issues. I‚Äôm doing aged care certification, they don‚Äôt tell you that you need 100% each assessment to pass and I have had assessor‚Äôs disagreeing with each others corrections causing me to waste a lot of time going back and forth. That‚Äôs actually if I get them looked at. I have waited months for assessments to be even looked at. Not to mention there are so many errors, spelling mistakes, incorrect information for current policies ( I work in aged care already so know some information is incorrect). This whole certificate is a waste of money and time you barely learn anything about aged care at all. You have to constantly chase to get things done and open space x is useless."
1,2021-06-24T08:24:03.000Z,I will never study through this place again,I don‚Äôt know what was worse: the ambiguous training material or the student support who kept giving conflicting information.I suggest you re-train and periodically test the people who are providing information to your students.I did not find the course worth the money (you cannot cancel and get a refund) or irritation that it caused me.
4,2021-09-07T02:25:24.000Z,I enjoyed studying marketing,Positives: I enjoyed learning about marketing and enjoyed the no pressure approach to get assessments done. It worked around my lifestyle and my job. Student support - great! I have also recently got a job in digital marketing.Negatives: sometimes assessors took a long time to mark my work so I couldn‚Äôt move on to next module and also some of the material in the course was really out of date. I‚Äôve learnt more from doing some digital marketing crash courses outside of open colleges.
2,2021-08-15T08:50:43.000Z,Would not recommended,"Would not recommended.Though the process of self paced online learning was ideal, the lack of correspondence and delayed markings of assessments was poor and drawn out. The assessments themselves were poorly written and assessors would frequently ask for resubmissions even though the feedback was positive and they identified the outlined criteria had been met. After finishing the course months ago I am still waiting on certification, despite me following up on multiple occasions."
4,2021-07-01T00:28:17.000Z,The course was good and the assessors‚Ä¶,"The course was good and the assessors were great.  I did struggle with some of the activities throughout the modules having incorrect information or answers, which caused some stress when trying to work out what I was doing wrong (which was nothing).Time given to complete the course was appropriate and support was there if needed."
5,2022-04-22T05:13:05.315Z,Done and Dusted! Diploma of Community Services,"No road is as easy as the other. Today I can proudly say ""Done and Dusted! The journey has not been smooth waters but getting the right kind of support and help was a great motivation to always look forward to the ending. I would like to say my big thank you to Rosan (Trainer/Assessor). He has been very helpful all along. I finally completed my Diploma of Community Services. I can't be thankful enough. With the pandemic, it has not been easy, however, perseverance was the key motivation for me to reach this far. Thank you Open Colleges and to all the support staff."
4,2021-07-23T22:12:21.000Z,All in all a great experience,"All in all a great experience, however at the end waiting for a transcript I paid for. I was informed I had to provide another first aid certificate as your course certificates can not be sent without a valid one. Given that first aid is a whole.module I believe the module should be moved to further into the course to avoid such problems at the end. I didn't receive an email or be told this had to happen until I called a week later asking where my transcript was. Very frustrating!"

1,2022-05-14T16:37:51.000Z,Thieves!!,"Thieves!!! I wish I could give open colleges a big fat zero stars! I did a certificate IV in vet nursing. Finished all my written modules with high distinctions and credits, however struggled to find a practice that would allow me to do my training portion, due to the fact open colleges do not have insurance and do not tell you this. Open colleges were no help in assisting me to find somewhere. After paying over $5000 they would not even Provide me with a transcript or statement of attainment for the work I‚Äôd completed to use as a credit transfer. Expect no help from these people."
4,2021-07-16T02:15:45.000Z,Diploma of Community Services experience,"Overall good experience, interesting course material. Assessors helpful, though not very detailed feedback for assessments which would be useful for academic growth.

It did take me much longer to complete the Diploma of Community Service than I thought it would but that was due to the pandemic which made finding Work Placement so much harder.It takes perseverance and diligence to complete an online study and Open Colleges are there for you if you need support with academic or other issues.I would recommend Open Colleges as it is an affordable way to upskill.

Open Colleges have been nothing but supportive while I have been unable to study, and with the hurdles throughout placement- they have been very accommodating to issues I was having within my placement organization.My WPA assessment was much more relaxed, and less nerve racking than I thought it would be, my assessor provided me with a lot of information and extra knowledge for me to apply in further study and work."

I was told I would get help, so I filled out some forms, only to have someone do google searches which I had already done myself. I found there was a very high turnover of staff which was frustrating. I believe I only got through this course because of the help I got from Rosan. Thanks Rosan for all you did for me"

Also an upfront fee of $30 to resubmit an assessment that was poorly written in the first place is ridiculous! Especially during these tough times.Would not recommend taking up a course with them. Would definitely steer clear and go with another college.

Due to the nature of being online, you definitely need to be self dedicated and it is easy to loose motivation, but there are multiple avenues of support should it be required. Connecting with study buddies, booking in faculty phone calls etc. Throughout my course I gained work experience which quickly lead to part time employment and then full time employment where I have now been employed for over a year in a job I love. Very glad I found open colleges and this course."

Given the student has completed at this point the theory (modules 1 to 7) and the practicality (120 of actual support work), I'm unclear on why the portfolio has to be such a large document to complete.

It has been 3 months. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend open colleges to anyone. And it was definitely not worth the $6,000"

I waited 10 weeks and more to have assessments looked at and then if I had to resubmit it would take weeks to have that checked.  It was very frustrating and I eventually put in a formal complaint which didn't seem to make a lot of difference.  It was 4 months from putting in my final assessments from my placement until I was finally graded and finished.  I was lucky that the place I got employment at didn't ask to see the certificate or I would have missed out on the job.****I don't have my certificate yet***

They are always very friendly. My only gripe is how long it takes to contact you're assessor if you have a question or need something clarifying. They tell you 10 working days but if you only need to alter something and send it strsigjt back. You have to wait another 10 days for a reply.  You can always check with student support but 9/10 they always reffer you back to the assessor(who was very helpful when responding). Course completed üôå

He also ignored all my emails. I was bullied but he did nothing. Even the patients were annoyed and disgusted on how I was treated. And yet in a covid pandemic another student didnt get into trouble for doing  her work experience while sick with a cold in a hospital. Double standards and bullying occurs here. Other places are much more professional.Also all placement paper work is not done online, so a nurse spilt water all over my notes and my tutor told me off when it wasnt my fault, said I was unorgansied.

I have had to ask why I haven't finished the course when I thought I had. This is because there isn‚Äôt a list that tells you what you still need to submit when it comes to assessments. I had missed a couple of things without realising. I am now at 96% complete and have submitted all of my assignments,  I had to ask why. The 4% that remains is admin stuff from the colleges side. When you're really excited that you've submitted the very last assignment and it sits at 96% with no explanation of why? It takes a little bit of the joy of finishing away."
1,2021-09-16T01:47:59.000Z,Poor teaching skills,Not happy with open colleges. Assessor tried to make me do an extra 40 hours on top of my already 120 hours of placement because I missed two questions on the placement portfolio. She didn‚Äôt understand my situation as I cannot do anymore placement hours before I need to earn a living. She was very anal and quite always marked me wrong on basic things. She wasn‚Äôt anal in the good way she was very repetitive. School wasn‚Äôt very helpful at all with finding placement and you have to find YOUR OWN. It took me over a year to find placement for a course that was meant to take 6-12 months. I should‚Äôve listened to the reviews about this course before joining because I would‚Äôve avoided it.

When I attempted to check the reading material, the open college had removed my access to course material.

I didn't like the rigidity of the assessments when the student wants to do more or better of what is asked then answers from assessors is ""Do not change the format of the assessments"", but the format of the documents limits the student to the minimum possible.I hate the way of assessing the practical part. Through 3 minute videos is imposible to really show everything you need and you have to become a master in video editing. It would be much better if the student has the opportunity to do like a work practice in a real work place and being assess in working experiences. But not sending videos to Open Colleges, just being assessed by a professional hortuculturalist in real life"

I started my Diploma in 2018 and completed it in Feb 2022. The modules are great, however, because it's online and you don't get to do face to face with a lecturer, you have to do a lot of reading. Basically, you will find it hard if you sometimes want to implement day to day activities without reading modules. One down side is that, they need to do better in helping find work placement. Otherwise, l am so much knowledgeable and up to now, i rely on my modules l have learnt for my employment. You have to prepare well for the Final workplace assessment with the assessors.

My son suffers from anxiety so before he enrolled in a Diploma, we spoke to Open Colleges about the high chance of him withdrawing and costs. We were explicitly told we would only pay for what he had done. We asked for all financial correspondences to be sent to wife. None of this happened. My son pulled out less than half through not having done any units. Open Collages pursued my son through their debt collectors for the full amount. I filled in their complained form which they dutifully ignored for three months. When they did finally look at it. They did not directly answer any of the statements made in it.

I experienced a lot of set backs during my studies (pandemic, health issues, difficulty finding placement, all whilst caring for my two young children with disabilities). I felt like giving up at one stage, but all it took was one person to say they believed in me. Well I believe in YOU! I went from being a stay-at-home mum for years, to now a graduate working in the industry as a team leader! The biggest reward from all of this is seeing my children‚Äôs faces light up when telling others that my mum helps people for work, I want to do mums job when I am older!

1,2021-07-26T06:30:09.000Z,$30 charge when handing up assignment for third time,"Was happy with the course until they started the $30 charge on your third attempt on an assignment. The comments received by the assessors can be misleading at times and the assignments themselves are written poorly so it's easy to make mistakes. Technical issues go with the online experience as well so this just adds to the problem. We are currently in a pandemic so money is a problem for everyone, so I can't see how they could think it's acceptable to start charging people money for simply making mistakes. We are here to learn not pay. This rule has been put in place to save assessors time, yet everytime I have to resubmit an assignment there is only ever one maybe two details I have missed. So how much time did it take to write a comment for one or two details?? The argument for the case to charge people makes zero sense."

Much to learn from the well structured layout with clear guidelines, that can help to perform the function as an HR professional.Good source of course material most trainers were great and helpful and feedback was given clearly and quickly that helped me to understand and learn.However, I experienced a trainer wo responded with feed back, that took up to 10 days(perhaps within the time for a trainer)this was not ideal as a student as the subject overlapped into other modules. This was not a good learning situation as I experienced the overall time took me a few months for those modules.I would recommend this course to others as Open Colleges delivered what it promised to me."

But half way through it want rapidly down hill.Months to mark assignments.Terribly written, I just had to guess what the questions were asking me.Extremely repetitive, I was actually copying and pasting my answers, very draining.NO support, I was msging my trainer and just had no reply, I then found out through a stream of chats that the trainer had just left, so no one had contact me about this.We finally got a new trainer who I felt very sorry for because God knows how many assignments she had to mark and when I was finally able to get in contact with her for some help with a question, she didn't even know what the question was asking. I can't stress enough on how badly written the assignments were."

Also to have regular monthly calls from the assessors/trainers to help keep students motivated, on track and better prepared.Many thanks to the assessors Victoria and Amanda for their professional knowledge, teaching and support, and to faculty and the student support team for their support, patience and understanding when I needed extensions applied.

2,2022-12-01T05:06:23.000Z,Honestly... Be wary.,"Open Colleges is Fine. If you have studied out of school, have the drive to self motivate and are prepared to wait a week for an answer for a basic clarity answer then go for it. There is a lot of talk about support and student support before you sign up, however, they are unable to address any coursework concerns so don't rely on that. Finding placement is difficult and the ridiculously long workplace portfolios make a bachelor's degree placement look like a breeze.-The student forums are littered with people lost in the work and particularly the ambiguity of the wording.-Everybody struggles to find placement (Not to mention complete the check in's etc)I completed my course and am working in the field, there is plenty of good staff involved in OC, however, there are major flaws in the design and industry reputation (There are even students stating they have to re-complete units when engaging in further study elsewhere)Just be wary - Studying while working full-time was great, and studying at my pace was also great. Just weigh up the pros and cons. I certainly wouldn't recommend to first-time students."

When I tried to become registered has a counsellor OC students have to do 24 supervisions throughout a year, compared to 12 like other qualified counsellors. It's like a diploma but you come out on your P's rather then your full licence. Given the cost and time given to complete this Diploma, I was frustrated that there was also no exploration from OC as to why this was either.However the staff are very lovely.The outlay was easy to navigate, and given that face to face learn as been disrupted during 2020 and 2021, I was very happy to be learning online from the beginning.And the path way to continue further study at Charles Sturt Uni is a fantastic pathway for those who wish to continue their studies."

I'm honored to now say that I hold a Diploma level of qualification.My experience has been like a roller coaster, When I started my Module 2 I wanted to give up and withdraw because I knew I wouldn't be able to achieve this qualification requirement. But the Assessors of Open Colleges especially (Rosan Lal) gave me a confident and hope of being positive and take things at a time this I applied to my daily study routine and I found myself. And today I am graduating everything is possible in this world, So never give up keep trying !!Thank you Open colleges for everything you did and yes this covid19 really teared us apart but we kept going.

I found the content of the course really well laid out and easy to digest, however the direct contact and support from Open Colleges was poor. The turn around time for marking at one stage was over 30 days, making it very difficult to learn and improve with momentum.The Assessors/Teachers were really helpful but for most of my time, inundated and difficult to reach.My advice to anyone who decides to take this course, really think about how much support you need. I found this course isolating, I tried many times to reach out to find a study buddy in Melbourne, but it fell through each time. that's not necessarily OC's fault, but it's food for thought.Second part of advice is to really search for a placement opportunity from the get go- don't wait, don't dilly dally, it was very hard for me to find an organisation to take me on as they usually are taking on uni students."

I understand policy rules and am always more than happy to follow them however, if a circumstance is beyond your control that impacts your ability to study, the policy should be reconsidered. Open Colleges is truly money focused and hungry and have absolutely no sympathy or understanding AT ALL. I was unaware of my mental illness when I enrolled and when I was diagnosed mid that year, my priority was NOT to cancel or do anything about my course but rather focus on my health and seek further help from professionals. Open College does not understand this. As my course has finished, they will not refund me because as I am not able to ‚Äòcontinue my course as it has expired.‚Äô And because of the pandemic, so many people have lost their jobs and are unable to continue to pay for their course but losing your job is not an excuse to them!!! So no, please do not sign up to any courses with them, unless you want to throw money away!"

Very inconsistent.It can sometimes be difficult to get in contact with some assessors as you can‚Äôt book phone calls with them. I also received misleading email communications - for example, I was sent an email saying that I could extend my course, but then when I applied for this I was told that my period to extend was expired (I had received that email on the same day). I was also sent an email saying that my course had expired and I didn‚Äôt complete it when in fact I had graduated. I had to call support to confirm this and resend my certificate of completion.The whole system is very cluncky. There is a lot of room for improvement.Aside from that, I had a really pleasant experience with one of my trainers - Catherine Tumelty. She was so responsive and helpful and was the silver lining throughout the time I was doing study. Keep her!!!"

I was told to send a special consideration form in March and haven‚Äôt heard back and it‚Äôs August. I‚Äôm 75% finished but I‚Äôm so worried I‚Äôm not going to be able to finish it now! I‚Äôve called and it transfers me to another company, I‚Äôve emailed my assessor and the student support multiple times, even complaining about the lack of communication! Still nothing. I‚Äôve even put in multiple requests on the website and haven‚Äôt heard anything. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve completely gone off the grid and now I feel like I‚Äôve wasted so much time to do my course with them. So close to finishing! Real shame.

I had no programming experience whatsoever and I got to make a website and even make an App from scratch! I never thought it possible in my wildest dreams!Open Colleges set up me for success.

1,2021-09-28T08:19:07.000Z,Not Recommended,At the beginning of my course Certificate III in Individual Support everything ran smoothly once I got further into the course things began to go pear shaped. Despite Open Colleges claiming to provide superior Student Support at times I felt very neglected and completely without support. Liasing with assessors in an attempt to get constructive feedback was like fighting an uphill battle and grading at times took months putting a complete roadbloack on my being able to progress further with my studies. The student portal would often malfunction which really took away from the convenience of online study. This course caused me severe stress as progressing further in my career and studies was put on hold due to their being understaffed and inability to mark assessments in a timely manner. Some of the assesors were a great help but all around this experience was not one I would wish upon anyone and I will not be studying through Open Colleges ever again or be recommending them to anyone else based on this experience.

The impact of Covid-19 made the choice easy but there were frustrations along the way. Studying alone is sometimes ideal but there is nothing better than bouncing off ideas with fellow students. Unfortunately, finding a study buddy, or buddies, is frought with difficulties - studying at the same level and intensity; studying at the same time; connecting with people you intrinsically like or dislike. These reasons can erode your enthusiasm and connectiveness to the study. It is an enormous challenge on top of the modules themselves.  In part, students begin the course in a staggered format, which leads to a level of non- conformity. Perhaps the College could connect students at the beginning, like an online class, so as students can connect and find friends to connect with. Otherwise, finding a study buddy is too haphazard.The content of the course was definitely comprehensive.Connecting with student support was simple and all were wonderfully helpful, as were the sssessors."

1,2022-03-26T01:47:34.000Z,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I studied through Open Colleges to get my certificate 4 in Youth Work. I completed all the theory modules and only had my work placement to complete when the first wave of covid-19 hit back in 2020. I applied to so many places that couldn't let me do my work placement because of the 1 person per 4m squared rule in offices. I extended my studies twice and after the 3rd time of trying to extend they wouldn't let me unless I had to pay the full fee of over $3,000 again to renew the course. When I told them I couldn't afford it and that I wanted to have my modules that I had completed on my USI statement of attainment they told me that it would be on there. I went on the USI website to check my statement of attainments recently only to find that instead of saying I have completed those theory modules they have put I withdrew/discontinued all of them. Which was not the case for those theory modules I put my time and effort into. From what I gather I cant even use those modules, that I have actually completed, to go towards RPL if I went into another certificate, meaning I have to do them all over again."
3,2022-05-06T04:49:40.000Z,It's not terrible. But also not great.,"This is not a terrible experience.The assignments are fine, I do appreciate the Assessment Walk through by Rosan - those are exceptionally helpful!The final assessment with your Work Place Assessor is surprisingly chill and there is really not something to stress about.The feedback given by assessors has always been helpful and very easy to have questions answered in time. I found the online staff regarding gaining access to modules and extending the course, extremely professional and efficient. I can not fault Rosan, Sarah and staff.My sub par rating for the course live in the material and assessments.Links in the modules rarely work, I found some of the information about particular subjects lacking, pointless and repetitive assignments and believe that the entire training package needs an overhaul. Module 8 is completely redundant.If you are needing this Diploma and you are already working in the industry, this is a breeze and may not actually broaden your knowledge or peak your interest *but* you'll get a qualification.If this is your first step into Community Services, it may be best to do some further research into Open Colleges before signing up."

When approached (several times) the student support and Trainers team were extremely helpful and genuine about wanting students completing there course.The feedback I would give is to have scheduled regular check up calls to keep students on track (reminder/check in emails are easy to either skip or miss all together). The main flaw with this style of education is the lack of 'face-to-face' contact which you would get in a classroom setting. Either this or have a timetable of due dates for portions of the course to minimise students not leaving enough time for each assessment or completion of the course.The Cert IV Vet Nursing was a very big Unit to complete, and certainly took up more time than ever anticipated. I certainly fell into the trap of not knowing how much time to allocate per task which resulted in extensions and cramming in a lot of the work at the 'last minute'.Having goals for where you should ideally be in your completed content during the set duration of the course would help immensely.The content and resources the course provided was great and informative, as well as very accessible help by trainers if approached.I appreciate every effort Open Colleges put into the eventual completion of my course.

2,2021-08-23T08:44:18.000Z,Disappointed,"Throughout this course I received very minimal support or help from the trainers. For example when I sent emails with my enquiries I received responses which was just copy and paste from the FAQ pages that I had already read but still needed further clarification.I did not feel that the trainers genuinely wanted to help if I requested more clarification than what was on the FAQ pages. An example for this is in one of the modules I had a total of 12 or more backward and forward emails to a trainer trying to ask for help as to where I went wrong, I was in the end instructed to just submit my work as it was because ‚Äòit was too hard to see where I went wrong without seeing the data‚Äô when I got the grade, the feedback stated that I needed to ask more questions if I was stuck on something. This was very frustrating to hear as I tried very hard to get further clarification but was told to submit my work by the trainer anyway.The overall wording of the activities, learning material and case studies was appalling and you can tell that no one has gone through and actually read the modules, and the activities recently to ensure it is kept fresh and up to date. Half the time it felt like double Dutch and like it was written by someone whose second language is English. I am shocked that this is how a cert IV is presented, especially when I paid over $3k for this course.There is no way that I would recommend anyone to use open colleges for study as this was a struggle."

I have been applying for jobs religiously since graduating (one year now) and cannot land a job or an Interview purely because my qualifications aren‚Äôt enough (remember, I was told they are) and little to no experience.Also, competing against psychologists who can get Medicare rebates will kill you, I could not gain one client because they all want a rebate.I wasted a ton of money getting an ABN, public liability insurances and indemnity, and anything else to try and work for myself. Not to mention renting a room in a private practice, bleeding money every week without any clients because again, they want a rebate.Anyways, I have given up on this career and have moved on, it‚Äôs a shame, I really wanted to be a Counsellor.So yes. This one star rating is for the lies I was lead to believe, total rubbish, this diploma won‚Äôt get you anywhere.Just know, if you do this course, it more than likely won‚Äôt be enough.Total waste of time, energy and money.That‚Äôs life I guess"

Once starting the certificate it was almost to easy to do, information given to you and you just need to make the answer shorter. As you go thru the certificate the teachers get more particular and start to be very detailed about why you didn't add something when stated not to or you can't go 10% over the word could but then you don't have enough. Asking for help just wasn't really an option unless you plan to wait for an answer that isn't helpful. You have to look for what you think is needed.Listen to the webinars but take some of it like a grain of salt as some teachers make there own rules.Student support was frustrating due to continusly having to simplify what I was looking after and then getting told to just contact your teacher as they got stuck.Getting a buddy to study with didn't really work for me.Support is needed with this course and people that understand exactly what you are talking about and not just guessing.Communication is very broken as you then wait days at a time just for a reply.1 year was not enough to complete the course as I finally did my observations to finish September 2021. I know covid had an impact but alot of this is online, how is it even affected.open module up early as there may not be someone in the office when you need it open.The only outlasting people that I felt did there job well was Trish who also taught cert 3 in disability and Nicole the RN from NT. These two workers showed compassion and wanted listen and help you, that was the qualities everyone needed and I thank them for that"

1,2021-06-29T01:27:07.000Z,Cert II in Horticulture,"I found it very difficult to progress through my course ""at my own pace"". Video assessment pieces were challenging, especially at first.I was assured that I did not need a workplace placement to complete the course, but in fact, it would have made it so much more relevant and easier in the long run.Modules were not unlocked at the start of the course and I was prevented from moving through while I waited on assessments to be completed (due to difficulties with videos), when I could have continued to progress.Due to taking advantage of a discount I was talked into enrolling when I knew I would have no time to work on the materials, and in the end had to pay for extensions (partly because of the time wasted waiting for modules to be unlocked) and partly due to continued work and family commitments.I also had some difficulty understanding one of the trainers when I reached out for clarification. It would have been easier to have one person to contact throughout the course, rather than have different people pick up questions on the discussion pages for each module's assessments.Assessment items had limitations such as ""one-page poster"", ""two-page leaflet"", or ""three minute video"" when it was impossible to present all the information required within these restrictions. Almost every presentation assessment required explanation of WHS considerations, when we had previously completed a module about WHS, and this took up time when an understanding of new material could have been demonstrated.Thank you for taking the time to respond to my review, although it seems as though my opinions have been dismissed. I never expected not to work to gain my qualification, nor do I fail to understand assessment guidelines and why they are in place. My further study will not be completed through Open Colleges."
3,2021-09-21T00:21:15.000Z,Qualified Student Review,"While I am so happy to have completed my course - I have had some time to reflect on my experience. While overall the experience was good there are some points I believe would be helpful for Open Colleges to look into.The student Platform 'Open Space' is not as user friendly as made out, it is not compatible with all devices used and the 'percentage' area is not in real time or sometimes does not update at all - the chat feature however, is fantastic.The modules are not set out in a way that makes much sense - many of the modules require you to stop halfway through as you cannot complete it without work experience, leaving you at the end with all these half finished modules which doesn't really make sense as you need to complete modules to unlock the next.Some of the questions in the modules are VERY cryptic - while there are module helpers sometimes the module helpers seemed more of a motivational speech rather than an example or help. So when you complete a task and submit the teachers are looking for something specific that was not specified in the question and almost felt like I had to read between the lines a lot. While the teachers were fantastic at helping when you asked for it - if the questions and tasks were set out clear and concise this would free up a lot of their time.I do also think a 'student manual' of some sort would be useful that sets out what task to do when and how to submit assignments. Sort of like an online checklist at the start that would also make it easier to see what is left to do.The tutors were very helpful when I needed it with very quick turn around. I do think the course needs a bit of tweaking just to help people get their qualifications as many times I felt unmotivated when submitting assignments knowing that I would have to resubmit again and again.Looking forward to receiving my certificate and I hope Open Colleges staff are all getting through this lockdown.Sophie"

They are unorganised, under staffed and the only way to get any issues resolved is to make formal complaints. The course material in Health and Leisure Cert IV does not cover enough practical teaching specific to Aged care lifestyle job role."
2,2021-06-17T07:36:15.000Z,Unhelpful trainers and support network,"My partner faced an immense toll on her mental health, having to pay extra money to take out an extension, just to get assignments marked and emails read, with little help from all involved.She has had a major set back on her career having spent thousands of dollars for her to be told she can‚Äôt receive her certificate due to open colleges not marking her assessment in time, a terrible organisation, who will not answer any phone calls or emails regarding the situation, I am still waiting for an answer."

I love that it was self pace, it was challenging but I managed to complete it with minimal support. I always found student services to be helpful and respond to queries in a reasonable time frame. If I decide to study further I would absolutely consider Open Colleges again."
3,2021-06-15T23:08:24.000Z,I was very appreciative that I was able‚Ä¶,"I was very appreciative that I was able to obtain my Certificate 111 on line and have the opportunity undertake my studies in my own time.  I found the modules interesting and relevant to what I was studying.  My modules and assessments were marked in relative good time however I did struggle with getting feedback in a timely manner.  Student Support were always very polite and helpful.However, when it came time to complete my work placement, the process caused me a lot of anxiety.  There was  no support from Open College in finding a placement and when I finally was successful there seemed to be a standoff between the facility and Open College.  There was no communication between the two and I spent hours on the phone trying to facilitate this process.  It took 8 months from when I was approved to when all documentation and paperwork was signed off to complete a mere 120 hours of actual placement.  The time I spent with the clients and other support workers was rewarding and I learned a great deal from these amazing people.  I would suggest future students are made aware of the challenges they are to face regarding the main part of the course ie their placement prior to commencing and paying their fees.  It would be helpful if Open College liased with specific facilities in all states in order to provide students with some direction regarding their placement.  If this were the case, facilities, students  and Open College would have  a mutual understanding of requirements.  It would be a smooth transition for students saving time and stress for all concerned.  In my opinion student placement is the most important part of the course but due to the complexities of documentation staff at the facilities have no time to deal with the additional workload and copious amounts of paperwork.Having the weekly communication on line was a great idea and unfortunately was only available at the end of my course but hopefully future students will benefit from this helpful guidance.Overall, I am pleased I did the course but what I initially believed was a 10 month course has drawn out to be 18 months and although I have completed my course I am still yet to receive my certificate."

Then staff are so rude and say that i am taking too long to do course - omg!  I have a friend who did the same course with another institution and they got their assessments back in about 7-10 days.Open Colleges assessors don't turn up to assess you and they never respond to emails.  I was forced to pay extra money to do an online manual handling course because assessor didn't turn up to assess my manually handling.I was so frustrated with Open Colleges, paid a heap of money for nothing, Finished everything and never received a result.I am in the process of taking legal action against them.Do yourself a favour - DONT enrol with Open Colleges."

Well, there was a tonne of work! The workplace portfolios alone are just a crazy amount of work. Getting through this coursework was so overwhelming. The work itself isn't hard, there is just so much of it that I couldn't see myself ever completing the cert. Thankfully, the team were willing to give me multiple extensions for my course. I started at the end of 2018, and only just recently completed the course in June of 2021. I only recommend studying with Open Colleges if you are a self-motivated individual."

Quite often I felt I was falling between the cracks, I'm sure with computers these days its not hard to write a program that monitors student activity and if there is nothing for a few weeks maybe flag that student for an assessor to touch bass with. The problems I have in my life are out of the ordinary and often I felt lost and that nobody know or cared (however everyone I talked to was always very helpful and understanding) Just feel this could help keep some students (like myself) motivated and on track."

I would highly recommend Open Colleges for your next studies. Thanks again!"
2,2021-06-06T08:49:43.000Z,May as well be a degree not a Celtic,The trainers put so much pressure on students to answer questions which have no relevance to the qualification. Peter McClatchey asked for adjustments to assesments on the final day of studies and his comments did not match the study materials or the questions in the assessment. The pressure this put on my partner who is a full time working single mum is ridiculous.

The course structure was user friendly and the staff were great and very helpful.   Some of the content such as developing X-rays in solutions was outdated compared to where I found work, however after realising some workplaces are still using this method I understood.   Something needs to be done to prevent students from contacting other students asking for thier answers or videos especially when I ticked off that I didn‚Äôt want to be a study buddy.   I found that incredibly rude when I was asked to send my video and my hard work by that student.  Some sort of blocking mechanism needs to be put in place when no study buddy is requested.

5,2021-05-22T06:02:51.000Z,Excellent and Supportive Study Environment,"I had really good experience with Open Colleges (OC). Some of my experiences I wanted to share:1. The trainers were very responsive to my queries. I was only available to study on the weekends but any queries I sent to OC, I always get a response by Monday when they get back to work on the weekday2. The assessment tips and especially the Webinars were extremely helpful for completing the assessments3. You do need to have Microsoft Office on your computer to make your life easier with the study4. I also like the fact that the course includes 2 memberships IPA & ABN as well as the subscriptions to Reckon.  That helps with starting me off the ground for bookkeeping works5. Would like the course to include Xero subscription and training, but you can always sign up for free 1 month with Xero and Xero does have free Xero HQ training if that's what you're after6. The turnaround time with the assessors to all of my submissions were within 2 weeks as promised. Most of the times much quicker, I guess it depends on how many assessments they got submitted at the same time.  The assessors were also very encouraging and provide easy to understand feedback should the assessment need to be resubmitted.7. One of the things I wanted to mention is the trainers/assessors are not there to provide us with answers to the assessment, they are there to guide us.  And sometimes I find their guidance helpful, sometimes I find them a bit vague, when I find the response a bit vague, then I asked more specific questions and usually then I get the response I needed to complete the assessment. So just keep your thinking hat on and remember the course is to give us the knowledge and also help us to develop the skills (like research) to be working as bookkeeper in the real world most of the times on your own8. The discussion board is also another place I find very helpful.  That's the first place I go to when I start each module's assessment to read through what all other people queries are so I don't have to ask the same question to the assessor.9. I started my course in July-20 and finished in May-21. But I had about 5 months break during COVID/XMAS (remember I can only study on the weekends). So really, this course can be done within a few months if you want to finish quickly. But you can also take your time and finish it within 2 years, so I think OC is pretty fair to have the course open for 2 years for most people to complete the course.I had in mind to start my own Bookkeeping business after this course, and I certainly feel that it has given me a lot of ground works to put me in the right direction. There are of course a lot more to learn and complete in order to start my own business. So in conclusion, definitely recommend Open Colleges."

Although the assessors are really lovely - while I was doing my course work and assessments they could sometimes take up to 2 weeks to respond back to me whenever I had a question.It was only towards the end of my course that they started to respond quicker because of how much trouble I was having with my placement (due to no contact with my workplace supervisor - so no check in phone calls and no answering questions about requirements) My workplace supervisor basically got fed up with OC and refused to sign my 160 hours of placement. I then had to do a further 40 hours of placement at another facility - which was impossible due to covid. - I had to pause the course for 6 months because of this. I was also told that I would get a special extension due to all of this only to find that my course expired with no warning. After having to call the student help line I was told I have to request an extension and write my entire situation on a form - even though they had record of it already and told me I didn't need to do anything.I do however appreciate OC apologizing to me for all this happening. Alex Nicol has been amazing through this process and has made me feel a lot better about it all. I finally have my diploma, but it sure took a lot to get it haha."
2,2021-05-04T13:05:59.000Z,WHAT A NIGHTMARE OF SCHOOL,"From my perspective as an experienced Nail Artist and Certificate III Nail Technology student trying to finish the course: intellectual content is ok. Dense material to learn in detail about the whole basics. Complex modules and strict with Legislations Health and Safety and legal rules. However: OUT OF DATE, old style techniques and processes of teaching. The course doesn't follow the advances of the market and the real life of the nail industry. It's cheaper than a proper school like TAFE, French Beauty Academy, etc but the stress of actually learning out of theory is exhausting! Finding your own clients to do things people don't really like? Find loads of people that are keen to receive treatment just for the extensive assessments: HELL. The work placements don't match the reality of salons with real clients. You cannot do assessment tasks on clients that are paying for treatments the way they want. It doesn't make any sense. Tiring: Find a workmate with time/patience to be your supervisor while they are busy doing their own job? Ask the workmate to analyze and fill up heaps of paperwork that should be the responsibility of the school? COME ON. Where on Earth a government-subsided school can be so corrupt and non-sense? Open Colleges is the nightmare of modern nail spas, nail bars, and fast-paced busy nail techs. Internet and small brands are on the market not only because they make money but because they teach and they sell reality for people that have a genuine interest and talent to be a nail tech already. If you're a newbe looking for a Certificate/piece of paper go for it (TAFE preferably) but OPEN COLLEGES: trash. Don't waste your money and time to ruin your patience, nights of sleep, and professional reputation among beauty colleagues."
2,2021-05-04T06:28:23.000Z,Assessment Assistance is poor.,"Where is the genuine assistance?We shouldn't have to submit an assessment to receive assistance as that counts as submitting which is terrible seeing as you get 2 go's before having to re-pay for an assessment.The course I chose is good, though the trainers are not really trainers because they are not training the customers, if someone asks for assistance why send the same generic template to everyone, why not give assistance as if it was face to face. I lost motivation doing this course because of the lack of assistance when it was needed and continuously re-submitted assessments because of this."
3,2021-05-04T01:13:05.000Z,Program contents and delivery method,"Overall, this online building and construction diploma program is good for people who already have tremendous practical experience; such knowledge is required to understand the program contents well and tackle the assessments. You are totally by yourself; there is little support available throughout the study period.The course contents should be regularly updated, including hyperlinks with course modules. For each module, there should be live lectures to facilitate a better understanding of the course topics and that students can ask questions. The recorded lectures should then be placed online. Regular tutorials should be held so students can seek help on specific topics and learn from the discussion of other students.In many cases, the assessment questions are wordy, vague. The assessment should be revised."
5,2021-05-03T22:58:49.000Z,Open Colleges has been amazing,"Open Colleges has been amazing. Yes it‚Äôs an adjustment learning online, but there is support if you just ask.I find the team on the phone could have a little more training on general information that you advertise on your website - with that said they are so friendly and will get back to you.Placement support from Hayden was incredible, I‚Äôm very thankful for his dedication and follow through.The trainers, especially Alex and Kelly are brilliant, great constructive feedback and willing to go the extra mile for students."

1,2021-04-27T12:34:50.000Z,Only study with Open Colleges if you want to become depressed.,"The Pro's-  Assessors/tutors seem nice.-  Nice Layout to the website.The Cons- So much information is incorrect or out of date, with much of the information at least 5 years old.- Many of the external links, including extra-curricular material they tell you to read, no longer work- Some extra curricular material they ask you to read does not seem appropriate to this level of course, but more suitable to a degree (that is a personal view).- Many grammatical and spelling errors throughout the course, including assignments, which are also worded poorly and can be hard to understand. Some assignment questions do not seem appropriate to the case study in question which makes answering them very confusing.-  The way the learning material is laid out does not flow and is confusing to follow along with.- There is no proper forum in which to touch base with other students, which I was told there was when I signed up.-  Their admin team is poor.  Multiple mistakes throughout my time with them including: telling me my course was ending a year before it should have due to them listing me as doing a different course;  I fell very ill during my course and they made me go back to my doctor repeatedly because they were not happy with the doctors certificate - in the end my doctor had to call them to sort it out! and;  I was also repeatedly told I could not extend my course when I in fact could which caused me intense mental anguish, as trying to fix their errors is incredibly difficult.- Due to Covid limitations I've been having difficulty securing a work placement for the past year (I'm in Melbourne) and getting Open Colleges to help is really hard, they just throw barriers at you. They need you to provide proof of the places you have approached for work placement before they will help you, but its hard to provide proof when everything has been done over the phone!  Basically, if you can't get a work placement for yourself you fail.  A couple of potential work placements I contacted seemed to reject me after I told them I was studying with Open Colleges, and I don't understand why.  I've almost ran out of extensions and have been told I can't apply for anymore.- When I signed up I was told it was virtually impossible to fail this course and that they would do everything they could to help you. That is not true.- This course has caused me to become incredibly depressed, which is insane as I did this course to HELP people with mental health issues (Mental Health Cert 4)- I tried to give them 2 stars but I just can't.  The pretty website and nice assessors just arn't enough, sorry."
2,2021-04-21T04:00:12.000Z,Be wary of Chris Hosking as your trainer,"The only good experience about open colleges is the amazing people on the student support end who helped me through the absolute difficulty it was trying to complete my cert III in captive animals under my trainer Chris Hosking.Chris would take far too long to respond to messages and questions and would repeatedly move appointments I had set for interviewer/student questions. I had to request multiple course extensions due to my appointments being shifted against my will.I'm sure theres some good excuse he has for this behaviour, and I apologise if this is not his fault, but this definitely should not be affecting his students academics.I may try working through open colleges again, but not under Chris Hosking."

3,2021-04-13T23:16:35.000Z,I have finished but not without disappointment!,"I am please to have finished the course, however the wording of the majority of the assessments had to be decoded. Not a lot was straight forward. It was easier to submit assessments I knew were not right just to get better feedback than asking on the forum. I believe the forum is for the students to ask questions and receive straight forward answers, not generic answers that have already been posted, then told to message directly through the message centre for further assistance. This really upset me and clearly doesn't help too many people due to the number of times the same question had been asked over the years on the forums was ridiculous. If the trainers had just answered it in a way that students understood in the first instance there wouldn't be repeated questions with the same generic answers.The Study Buddy System.... Having to log into just a get a message is super annoying! There should be an application that allows messages to come though without the need to log on every day. I often did not log on when I studied as I downloaded everything. I did however have to connect through my own social media networks to make it work. This is certainly in need of improvement.and one more thing.... students are marked on the nitty gritty of spelling and grammar etc, perhaps the course writers and workbook publishers need to do a big overhaul and proofread there own work before judging us on our work."

Response times to queries was likewise really good, from both the trainers and the student support team. During my course I encountered some personal family issues. The organisation was extremely understanding and I was able to extend my course duration out to help me sort out these issues.Open Colleges is very deserving of the 5 star rating."
1,2021-04-07T03:26:53.000Z,Please never study with Open Colleges,"Please never study with Open Colleges. It is the biggest regret I have done. They are scammers and all they care about is money. They took extra fees from my account for MONTHS. and blamed it on my bank.. then back tracked what they said and apologised, then kept taking more money . $12 EXTRA every payment!!!!! There is no student support. They will no refund me. Even though it‚Äôs their fault. They take days to reply to emails. All they care about is money. They make it Impossible to cancel from the course and you will have to pay a fee. They know they‚Äôre doing people wrong yet they get away with it!So many people I have read online have also had the worst experience with this company. If you are reading this and looking into studying with Open Colleges, please do your research and read more reviews like mine. I will never recommend this online college to anyone . They will make you pay a fee the longer you are into your course, the more your fee is to cancel. They will never admit they‚Äôre wrong and some of the replies I‚Äôve gotten were so unprofessional. No matter your circumstances, they will overlook it and make you pay to cancel. They‚Äôre at fault & they got away with it. I hope someone takes it to the news so AUSTRALIA knows not to use this company"

I have come away with a national accreditation and found the course to be very current with regards to information and structure within the industry that I was studying.  The course is well set out, the learning support is very structured and I never felt if I did experience difficulties that I was on my own.  I would highly recommend this type of online learning.  If you are motivated and stick to your study commitments this is a great way to gain work ready qualifications"

They offer 'online support' who can only help with navigation not any actual course content, for that you need to book a telephone appointment online which is often a week or more from when you need the help. Or you can inbox your teacher and hope to hear back in about 10 days or more. After accessing ONE MODULE and receiving little to no help in progressing, if you decide this provider is basically useless to you they can offer you $2000 of your $6500 payment as a refund.I have studied through OTEN however and find them far more supportive and helpful"

All assessors were quick to respond to any queries and were a wealth of knowledge. I love the fact it is all self paced which helps when managing families etc. My only recommendation is there needs to be more support for organising work placement. It was extremely difficult to get organisations to respond. Having a representative from open colleges who could contact the organisation would be helpful.

However I think it would be a benefit to student (especially those who are new to the field/going through a career change) is being a bookkeeper for a mock business. Where you need to set-up the books, chart of accounts, do receivables/payables, BAS, EOM, reconciliation etc. Even though there was a whole module in learning accounting software, unless you are familiar with it, it was difficult as I had to stop and read the instructions for the next step. It would have been good and beneficial if we could actually put what was learnt into practice as an extra assessment.Also getting halfway through MYOB only then having to learn RECKON was not fun and pointless in my view. Students should be learning ALL the available software or at least the more popular ones such as Xero or MYOB.I had issues with a trainer. I had questions with an assessment and I wasted over a week in emails back and forth, as her feedback was not making sense. It was only when I realised that she was giving feedback for the incorrect assessment.Apart from those minor issues, I absolutely lives the course and I so excites to start my next venture."

3,2021-03-24T23:31:59.000Z,Altogether: Good,"Studying through Open Colleges has all the expected pros and cons. You can study in your time, but that means you need to organise yourself. It also means that it can be a bit harder to contact the right people, and access the right support, because you can't speak directly to anyone. That said, student support was always quick to respond - it just took a few goes to get my message across. Altogether, I'm glad I decided to do the certificate through Open Colleges. It worked out well because otherwise my course would have been made a lot more difficult or delayed due to the pandemic."

Claire cooper was very helpful and probably the only person at open colleges that I felt cared about me and my studies and helped me along the way.I ended up completing the whole portfolio 1 for no reason when I was meant to jump straight to portfolio 2. I wasted a lot of time when this was a transfer credit. It was apparently written on paper however, I feel that these assignments are just so big and take a lot of time that someone should be contacting me about what to do as it never said I didn‚Äôt have to do it on the module section... IT SHOULD NOT BE ACCESSIBLE IF I SHOULDN‚ÄôT HAVE TO DO IT!! this was more then disappointing and the exact reason I wouldn‚Äôt recommend open colleges to others. There needs to be more contact about what assessments are needed to do and what doesn't need to be done when you get credit transfers. I am glad to be finished now. Thank you Claire for your support during these tough times and for always replying as quickly as possible to my emails. You are the best. Thanks"

I was looking for a school to specialise in Leadership and Management on the Internet and I was very blessed that I chose Open Colleges and I'll never regret my choice because I found more than what I expected. Since it was my first experience with electronic learning, I found a great help and assistance from staff and all student support officers by email and even by phone. I thank all of them so much.During my studies, whenever I face a problem, their reply was fast and helpful.For the trainers and assessors, they were very kind and helpful. They are ready to assist at any time. They give constructive advice to help me excell in my assessments. They are passionate about seeing their students succeed and make achievements.I wish the assessments would be assessed by trainers and assessors in less than ten business days. Also I wish the resources would contain sample case studies and activities with hints.Overall, my experience at Open Colleges has been exceptional and unforgettable. I'm happy that I graduated but at the same time very sad that this nice experience comes to its end.Once more, thanks a lot to all the working staff at Open Colleges Australia.

4,2021-02-16T00:27:40.000Z,Thanks Open Colleges just a few points.,Dear Open Colleges I learnt so much during my online study experience and appreciated all the support I received. As a mature aged tertiary educated student heading back into the workforce I found the Online platform was challenging at times to follow /uploading scanned signatory pages for work placement etc however Student Support was very patient and helpful! I have gained many IT skills. Huge amount of content and work required each module and repetitive at times and sometimes the feed-back from assessors was pedantic. However all the content was very relevant and informative. Luckily I was not in a great hurry to finish the course so length of time for marking was not an issue for me.  Assessors Please send all relevant checklists to supervisors/students at the start of placements to make clear your requirements at workplaces regarding manual handling accreditation/ supervision / co- signatures and input into portfolios. As students we are often working with a different person every shift and managing a huge workload at home. So need  all the guidance we can get to avoid things getting missed or confused. Both my supervisors at two different workplaces were wonderful but can imagine others not being quite so patient. Given the year of Covid understandable difficulties for assessors/students/supervisors and workplaces.The in-depth and amount of work required from this particular course must be designed to increase the quality of the Care Support Workers that it graduates as was very challenging and a lot of information/work involved.  Well done for the aged-care industry but I would imagine many people would not have the IT/writing/practical skills required to complete this course properly.  Would be interested if there were past courses that were simpler?  Thankyou to everyone who supported me on my study journey I have secured employment which was my main goal!
1,2021-02-15T20:35:13.000Z,Hands down the worst company,Hands down the worst company.- No Support from MOST of the teachers- None or very delayed reply to emails- Had to remind them to process my Diploma after I waited one month already- One teacher ignored me and continued to keep failing my work without adding another explanation- I went through the complainant method and no action was implemented- They do not care if you are not actively studying- Assignments can be marked up to 6 weeks later- They make everything seem like it is your fault.If you would like to have a stress free study path.

1,2021-02-11T00:38:57.000Z,Very stressful and overwhelming.,"Getting information is a constant struggle. Student support gives conflicting information. Allowing at least 3 business days for assessors to reply to an email then finding they don't always actually answer your questions or provide the support that your needing. Trying to speak with an assessor is like pulling teeth as student support don't seem to like to give out the link to book in a phone call. Time frames for having assessments marked is a complete joke most of the time. The work placement process is a major nightmare with very little if any support, you have to be prepared to fight for any support that you may need which makes the whole thing a completely stressful and overwhelming experience."

1,2021-02-09T09:20:08.000Z,"UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT - OC DELIVERS MISERY, NOT POSITIVE EXPERIENCES!","After enrolling in an online course in mid-2020, due to chronic illness I was unable to continue, and advised OC IN WRITING on 17/11/20.  No response.  I sent my letter by FAX, and then followed up with at least FOUR emails.  Still no response or acknowledgement of my cancellation.  I knew I would be subject to a cancellation fee.  As I had a direct debit arrangement in place, I suspected they would continue to take payments ONLY UNTIL the cancellation fee was covered.  SURPRISE, SURPRISE!!  They took a further TWO instalments beyond what they were entitled to!In desperation, I called them instead. A very apologetic ASHLEY tells me that she was 'about to call me' (Pffft! - That old chestnut!).  I am told I need to complete a formal Application for Cancellation (don't know why, when they already have it in WRITING from me!!)  Although furious, I complete the form and return it within hours of receiving it.A further THREE emails later, I finally receive notification that my cancellation has been accepted (on 23/01/21, however no mention of when I would receive a refund of the fees STOLEN from my account!Over a WEEK later I receive another email from the 'Cancellation Team' (what a joke) asking for my bank details so that they can refund my 'overpayment'.  That was almost two weeks ago.  And I'm still waiting!!PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS - BUYER BEWARE!!As any student knows, when enrolling, you have to part with your deposit INSTANTLY from you bank account, otherwise 'no enrolment'.   BUT, come time to request a refund, suddenly there is LITTLE OR NO COMMUNICATION from OC, and refunds can literally take MONTHS to process (assuming you get one at all!).This company/business has no MORAL COMPASS - they LACK basic courtesy and CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS.  Once you hand over your money, that's the last you'll see of it. They're NOT INTERESTED in refunding your fees.Indeed, one has to wonder whether a qualification from OC is even legitimate, or recognised!!!Take my advice - learn from my mistake - DO NOT TRUST OPEN COLLEGES!  There are a myriad of other respectable tertiary providers that DESERVE your support.And if, like me, you have suffered a loss, do what I'm about to do. Lodge a formal complaint with the ACCC, in the hope this morally bankrupt, clearly fraudulent business is investigated and, ultimately, shut down before too many more innocent and trusting consumers are ripped off!I, for one, am not done yet."

Luckily, my student assessor was lovely and really helpful.I don‚Äôt think I would study 100% online again because you do need the regular interaction with other students and teachers."
5,2021-01-26T05:16:38.000Z,You can do it!!,At first I was really hesitant to commence my Diploma of Community Services. I actually wanted to opt out but I decided to see how far I could go first. I found the whole online experience easier than expected. Rosan Lal was my assessor and he was most supportive. He has a wealth of knowledge and really just made me feel confident that I could complete the course. In the end it took me 9 months to smash the course out and I‚Äôm so glad I persevered. I recommend Open Colleges to any one wanting to up skill or learn more about the field their interested in.
2,2021-01-26T00:10:57.000Z,Would not recommend,The content was not engaging and I feel as though there was very little support from Open colleges. The assessments were also very dull so if you are interested in this course I‚Äôd go elsewhere

That was due to it being all online and so required more self-motivation. Also on top of full time work and 4 kids. Open colleges were good - understanding about the need to extend. I felt they were a reliable course provider. There were quite a few irritating minor errors, typos, in the course material but not a big deal."

Throw in learning online even harder when you need things explained.  Some of the learning material was not correct and when you asked the assessor responsible for that module you would sometimes not get assistance at all.Some of the teachers were amazing with their feedback and explained things clearly when giving feedback on an assessment.I am just thankful I got through this course in 1 year as I set my goals and achieved them.
5,2021-01-22T02:49:08.000Z,This course was very enjoyable,"This course was very enjoyable!

4,2021-01-20T21:31:56.000Z,Happy with the outcomes,I started the course very worried as academically I struggle and I didn‚Äôt know how I would cope with it also I lead a very busy lifestyle and I didn‚Äôt know if I would be able to keep up.However this course and style of studying was exactly the right fit for me. It helped my confidence and I loved the fact that I could do it at my own pace. I set small goals and had regular breaks so the course didn‚Äôt feel like it ruled my life.The trainers were very helpful and the open space portal was easy to use and navigate.My only wish is that open colleges offered more courses so that I could continue with my next course with them.
1,2021-01-20T15:44:24.000Z,Avoid unless you want to be extremely frustrated.,"I wanted to complete a certificate in events management, and I never had a more frustrating experience in my life. Unless you can understand all the resources and assignments without any help, you're screwed because you'll need to email for help (if they ever respond).I often ran into grammar/spelling mistakes across the modules and many of the resources were broken URLs and outdated information. You'd have to hope the website was working too, because often you weren't able to access your assignments or upload them. Also, don't expect any communication from Open Colleges, apart from automated messages letting you know your course will expire in X amount of months.Now for the biggest problem that left me pulling my hair, work placement. DO NOT rely on them to help you in any way. I approached OpenColleges for support after having no luck finding work placement, first they told me to look for virtual events (as covid had sent NSW into lockdown) but then was told by my support officer that they would not be contacting any potential host organisation because of covid. Also, I never received any information on how the process worked, and I just felt more confused every conversation I had with them.As my course was reaching expiration, I also asked about a possible course extension. First they told me to apply for one through the website, which didn't work so I had to contact them directly. Then I was told that my extension was being processed because of my emails. More confusion.With covid finally easing, and small events going ahead, my 'support' officer finally had some potential organisations. Of course, now they insisted that I contact them which was different from what they told me initially. On top of that, one didn't fit the criteria for work placement and two were in completely different states from me (and no, they were not doing virtual events or ones near me). So out of 7 potential organisations they sent me, 3 weren't suitable and the rest weren't looking for work placement students.I ended up not even completing my course, and when I asked for my transcripts in case I did want to complete it in the future (definitely not with Open Colleges), they said they weren't able to. Lucky I was able to sort this out with TAFE NSW.So, learn from my mistake and go somewhere else. Because the only thing I learnt from my 2 year course, was that Open Colleges value profit over education."
3,2021-01-20T14:32:52.000Z,Good but slightly challenging at times,"Open colleges overall was a good platform for online studying, however there were times where you could have a full day of studying planned but get to a roadblock when you need to ask/discuss something with the assessor as unfortunately there‚Äôs no live chat with them, to contact them it‚Äôs over email type message and sometimes it could take a day or two for them to respond to your message/query. This isn‚Äôt ideal for students who work full time and take off a day dedicated to completing a days worth. It is also a bit tough when you need to wait 10 days for an assessment to be graded when the second assessment follows on from the first. This being said, all the assessor‚Äôs are extremely helpful and try to help as much as they can. And the support team were fantastic, helped me out whenever I had a general query or opening up the next module within minutes over the live chat!I did find that sometimes the questions asked in the assessments weren‚Äôt clear enough. Especially towards the last module. When studying online, a bit more guidance and clarification should be put into the assessments so students know exactly what is expected from them. Especially in research assignments where the information isn‚Äôt included in the module content.Overall though, the portal is easy to use, it‚Äôs a great community, the staff are friendly, it‚Äôs easy to connect with study buddies and you can ask for help when you need it.A challenging but good experience!"

1,2021-01-17T23:14:55.000Z,Very Poor,The fact there is only one assessor is ridiculous. The course content is repetitive. Their should be one module on Safety at the start of the course rather than repeating similar questions. Student support have no course knowledge so the one person that can only answer questions makes it difficult. Lack of leadership of Mamagement has alot to be desired.

I started writing down which ones initially to relay this information back to OC but lost count early on.Great support and help from my assessors for assignments. I found the video webinars for assignments very helpful and beneficial. Doing more of these throughout the course may help students.

I spent so much time discharging assignment tasks whilst on placement, I struggled to learn how my host org works. Can there be more assignments prior to placement and more tasks defined by your workplace supervisor?"
1,2021-01-08T12:42:40.000Z,Horribly worthless,What a horribly unprofessional organisation. Took weeks to respond to my emails about wanting to cancel my course. Once they finally did respond and say I‚Äôd be payed back what I was owed I‚Äôve now spent weeks chasing my money. Only to receive a joke payment of $6.88 today. Will be taking this further what an absolute scam.

The flexibility offered through an online course was helpful especially for anyone needing to continue with work and every day life commitments.Recommend teaming up with a study buddy early as this really helps to maintain motivation.
4,2021-01-04T03:48:26.000Z,Trainers were great,"Trainers were great, course content and assessments were relevant to the actual course I studied however sometimes I feel like I enrolled myself into a drama class with the amount of filming and editing required to be submitted but I suppose this is an online course and the trainers do need to visually watch how I would conduct meetings, discussions etc. Overall a good course, I also learned how to edit short video clips whilst taking the course and would recommend Open Colleges to anyone looking at improving their skills"
4,2020-12-29T03:43:16.000Z,Review,"A great college to study with however at times there were poor communication and difficult to understand due to bad phone lines and personal accents. It became frustrating at times when trying to get in contact with a particular person and not being able to get through.My assessors were always there when I needed them, just took some time to get a response."

5,2020-12-22T03:10:55.000Z,Diploma Of Building and Construction,Completed my Diploma of Building and Construction. The assessors for the course were extremely helpful. The detailed feedback on each question in assessments was helpful for re-submitting answers and for future personal development.Assessments were reviewed and marked quickly. Always had the option to organise a phone call for a detailed explanation of questions to aid in answering them in better detail. Will definitely study with Open Colleges again in the future.
5,2020-12-20T21:09:15.000Z,Very helpful teachers,Very helpful teachers. Very easy to get help on assignments and understand the questions which need to be answered.
2,2020-12-20T12:03:08.000Z,Assessments took a very long time to be‚Ä¶,"Assessments took a very long time to be marked (before Covid hit)When needing assistance regarding an explanation of questions to complete (and what the questions were asking) most assessors gave feedback that mirrored the questions that were hard to understand in the first place! To add, most assessors aside from one or two took their time responding by email. ( I would like to mention Eliana Vogiatzis as the only assessor at Open Colleges that gave me 100% support and assistance at all times and who was efficient, prompt, helpful and understanding towards me and my needs while studying.I commend her professionalism and demeanour)The procedures of submitting in assessments was extremely challenging and difficult- not everyone is technically minded!Student support staff made errors regarding unlocking correct modules and gave incorrect information regarding how much I still needed to complete, therefore when I thought I was almost finished my course, I then discovered there was additional assessments to be completed.Most assessors were very anal about submission of work and were too picky over trivial matters that weren‚Äôt a big deal, however delayed marking assessments until these minor details were corrected and I went through the process of then resubmitting.When I finally completed my course I was told it would take 4 to 6 weeks for my diploma to be sent to me. After almost 5 weeks went by I received an email from O.C informing me that records of my up to date first aid information needed to be viewed by O.C before they could release the diploma to me!  Why was this request not brought to my attention well before the weeks went by?? Then when I forwarded this information it took another few days for O.C to then actually mail the diploma and it was another week after that for me to finally receive it in the mail. I was then devastated to see my diploma all bent and twisted in my mailbox- aside from stamping a very small message of ‚Äòdo not bend‚Äô on the envelope, no other efforts were made to ensure my diploma reached me in good condition. (Example: providing a cardboard backing to protect the diploma from being mishandled in the mail, instead of only providing a flimsy plastic sleeve!)A disappointing and stressful experience with Open Colleges in general and therefore I cannot recommend this  service to others."

1,2020-12-18T00:09:46.000Z,Good support - OK material - Placement,"The online support was helpful and prompt.Feedback and support from assessors was usually timely and beneficial.Course material and assessments need some editing.Some of the placement tasks were asking a lot of an organisation and student. To have a student interview a young person at risk with coexisting issues ask about family and various other triggering topics is potentially dangerous. Then to have a response of, ""if you can't do it there, find another placement"" is unrealistic. A. Its hard to find a placement and b. Are you supposed to find a placement just to be able to do a few tasks? Doesn't sound reasonable."
5,2020-12-17T22:08:15.000Z,So glad I went through Open Colleges,"I completed my Diploma through Open Colleges, I found the platform to be great and was always up and running and there were no glitches or issues that prevented me from doing my work. All of the assessors and trainers were easy to contact and got back to me quickly. When it got to my final face to face assessment I was really worried having to do it over zoom due to COVID restrictions but the assessor Rosan made me feel comfortable and relaxed and was really supportive throughout the entire process. I cannot recommend Open Colleges enough! I have found employment in the industry I was studying and Open Colleges supported me in this from start to finish."

4,2020-12-17T03:39:06.000Z,Overall positive if you are self motivated and have support for video/audio assessments,I enjoyed studying with Open Colleges because it allowed me to go at my own pace. Each time I needed help student support and the assesors were helpful. I probably wasn't expecting to involve friends to help with video/audio assignments to the extent required but once I got into a rhythm I could organise them reasonably quickly before moving forward. I also got a little frustrated when trying to communicate via message system only as there is about a 3 day time lag for a response and sometimes the question I had was minor but held me back from moving forward. The course content was good and able to navigate it with ease.

I was able to access my account from anywhere in the world. I liked that I could pick it up and put it down to suit me. I have been working full time and have moved house twice since I started the course and nothing was affected. The staff respond to queries or questions very promptly and assessments were marked and sent back within 10days. I would definitely do another course through Open Colleges.
4,2020-12-12T09:58:01.000Z,Cert IV Bookkeeping & Accounting,"I think some of the units, whilst interesting, were not at all what I was expecting.  Perhaps having a choice of elective options might be more useful?  I also felt that more review and practise of the first few modules would have been helpful as this is what most people (well, me) undertook the course to learn - balance sheets, P&L, budgets, payroll, BAS, AR/AP.. More exposure to these topics further along the course would be helpful as refreshers/enhancers.  Having said that, I learned a lot and the trainers and assessors were very helpful.  Studying this course from interstate was frustrating with the time difference and working full-time.  Generally happy though, and would recommend the course."

I have written confirmation from Open colleges confirming  I am entitled to a refund. But they wont pay it. Every week they have a different excuse. It seems the company is not fiancially secure as they dont have the money to make  the refund. Their director even lied to the office  of fair trading saying they had refuend me. absloute lies.BUYER BEWARE
1,2020-12-07T11:24:17.000Z,Steer clear of Open Colleges....,"I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Open Colleges to anyone.  The poor service starts with the high pressure sales pitch to get you to enrol, with minimal information supplied about how it all works, the support you get or the course content.Then from the onset of the course there is no support at all.  I realise it‚Äôs an online course, but there is no follow up - EVER.  No one rings or emails to ask how ur going or if you need help.  I had over 6 months off for personal reasons and no one checked to see why.  And then when I came back and emailed and requested help, no help came.  I also phoned and asked and no help came.  I got 3 extensions which they happily took my money for, but didn‚Äôt ask why and again, no help came.The course material is poorly written and lacks substance.  The links often don‚Äôt work or direct you to pages that are out of date. The Assessments are extremely unprofessional with spelling and grammatical errors everywhere, links don‚Äôt work, even the font type and size change mid document.  Often statements and assessment questions are contradictory or don‚Äôt make sense.  And the project mngt unit is written for Real Estate agents when I‚Äôm studying interior design.  How hard is it to ensure it‚Äôs relevant to the subject you‚Äôre studying?The Lecturers are very hard to contact and will only answer through Open Space and sometimes it takes a week to get an answer on something.  Assessment Feedback has often had another student‚Äôs name on it and you can tell it‚Äôs cut and pasted from someone else‚Äôs assessment.  I‚Äôm not sure my Diploma is worth the paper it‚Äôs written on and have very little faith that it‚Äôs of any value to an employer in the real world.  Very very disappointing.  I will never study through them again and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend them."
1,2020-12-05T22:58:41.000Z,I find it way hard,"I find it way exacerbated the subject and context formulated and very unclear what the request asking me to do. Also compare with university and other branches and other options who finished uni in educational says open college is so hard to understand the subjects. To many photos and activities requirements which it make very hard and discomfort for student to complete the requirements and expectations. With Covid open college didn‚Äôt abustle the subjects to meet the restrictions in delivering the task such as portfolios when requires preparation of food or sensory activities where water, play dough, slime etc has been banned from child care. Open college didn‚Äôt took this in consideration.One of big issues was with the trainers. Exempt Lyndal W. Athens was unhelpful, for example if I asked questions they answered back ‚Äú thank for Richie me have a nice day‚Äù or not explaining anything clear. Another example, with my portfolio task some of the trainers doesn‚Äôt know well the program as they can‚Äôt check on student if the gave to do that particular task or not, if that‚Äôs part from electives or not, if that is student chooses subjects or not, if the task is unlocked or not. I have that issue to get back feedback that the portfolio is unsatisfactory bcz the stasis are not complete which she should have checked before mark out the portfolio.

All feedback whether positive or negative was useful. Course work was generally good although there were multiple mistakes in the course material such as spelling mistakes which came across as rushed and not as professional as would have been expected this could be due to the changes in the course halfway through.All questions were answered well and were helpful and were given in a reasonable time. Changing from the original course where you needed to find people to help with videos to the new course where you videos onto the website was a great improvement as it was impossible to find willing people who understood what was expected of them.Some if the modules had videos to explain what was expected which was helpful particularly to those with different leaning types such as audio style of learning.It was a well run course with brilliant lecturers who were always willing to help. I would recommend it.
4,2020-12-03T01:16:11.000Z,Review from a mature aged student,I found 90% of the course to be excellent and have gained a lot of knowledge throughout the course.  Your assessing team are awesome and give excellent help.  I found support give very timely responses to queries. The one thing I feel needs improvement is letting students know in advance about the number of videos they will have to submit throughout the course.  It would help to know what type of Video editing software there is available such as VideoPad and a few tips on editing would also help.  It wasn't until half way through the course that I found suitable software and this made the course a lot easier to manage.

They are money hungry and do not care about their students.I requested to leave my course after already paying $2000, stating that they could keep what I had paid I just couldn‚Äôt afford to pay anymore because of financial hardship; and they refused to let me do so unless I claimed bankruptcy. They encouraged an 18 year old to claim bankruptcy if I wanted to stop any further payments.Absolute disgrace of a school, as my parents who are both pensioners had to help me pay the rest of my course that I didn‚Äôt even get to complete.Shame on you open colleges."

I am not a disciplined person and I also I was not sure about my career goals after moving to Australia. However I found with them, motivation, flexibility and empathy. Specially with the assessor Georgina Antoune, who sent me messages that made me keep going and guided me with value knowledge. I already recommended the course for a friend who is having a similar great experience and I will continue to recommend Open Colleges as it is a platform that looks to each student considering and listening to their history and conditions. I felt respected, supported and motived to create amazing paths to my career. Thank you to all Open Colleges team."

I appreciated being able to work at my own pace and set my own deadlines but it also became too easy to slack of at times, so, for example, if there was a reminder message sent if nothing had been uploaded for 2 weeks saying ""its been 2 weeks since you've uploaded anything, team up with a study buddy or speak to your trainers if you need any help"" etc would be good motivation while still working at your own pace."

I felt totally unsupported from the start, forced to navigate blindly through the course. Waiting days for a reply, or not getting any reply at all regarding academic questions, planning a zoom video call or getting my assessments marked; getting my work placement approved 2 weeks AFTER starting it, when lodged 7 weeks earlier; not getting my checkpoint calls during the work placement; not getting the phone call I had booked to ask questions; ending up having to do the workplace observation via Zoom video 6 months after I had finished the placement, simply because the trainer seemed to never properly read my emails and follow our conversations; and the list goes on... I noticed from the start it seemed there wasn't enough trainers for the large amount of students, so I tried to be understanding and patient, but it was only when I ended up lodging a formal complaint after so much frustration that things seemed to move a little faster, even though it still took another 3 months (which I paid as extension) waiting to do the Zoom video and for the trainer's last report to graduate. The content of the course on the portal was very interesting, but many links were unavailable and in need to be updated; the assessments were very stimulating but all in all, I would not recommend Open Colleges as the whole experience was very stressful when it could have been an enjoyable one."

Had I spoken to the assessor from Module 1 earlier, I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted my time on trying for an RPL and I would have found doing the assessments much easier. I found the communication on most of the assessments vague, resulting in anxiety over submitting and what I feel as wasted time in having to resubmit. I also fund the structure of the whole course to be a waste (but I think that would be the case regardless of who I studied with)and can understand why qualified bookkeepers have absolutely no knowledge when they have been employed in the past.

I then had to search for sites myself which took extra time. Help was always provided by open space . Placement was easy to obtain. The placement assessor was very friendly however their visit was short which resulted in the inability to perform all tasks required and meant I had to go out of my way to provide additional information which took extra time. Due to the knowledge and skills I gained through the course I was employed by the childcare centre I did my placement with on the 3rd day during my placement. Thank you open colleges.

I am appealing to the public, prospective, or candidate intending to enroll in this college to think twice. Beware!!!!  Once you are enrolled you are trapped. They respond negatively when you decide to withdraw or cancel your enrollment due to the financial problem caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and in spite of not taking a single course. They then resort to chasing the victim around using a debt collector. Shame on you Open Colleges all you are interested in is money $$$$ to the detriment of student SHAME ON YOU."

Had money taken out of my account over $700 after my course had been paid for already, took months to get back. On good point is Fiona my tutor who was invaluable. Do not use this company, poorly written content also."

The content was very relevant with a mixture of reading, as well as videos. I had a great experience studying Diploma of community service at open collages and I would definitely study with open collages again!"

Which when I contacted open space help desk , I was given this extension free of charge.As of the 27th of this month I had still heard nothing from my assessor, I then contacted her and asked how much king we it would be and she finished me off that night.I then did not receive a congratulation email and transcript until I phoned and asked for it.Very disappointed with the end process"
3,2020-11-05T05:24:44.000Z,review,I found that the waiting time between submitting an assignment and getting feedback to be too long. there were times were I could not progress because I was waiting for feedback. My practical placement assessor was the quickest turn around which I appreciated. I would recommend your course but feel that there should have been more content in the Speech Pathology unit as when I started my placement even after completing all the theory I had to be taught a lot of basic speech therapy techniques and disorders. I feel the course did not prepare me for the basics of working in a practice in regards to actual therapy.

Open Colleges allows for you to work within the hours you can achieve.Would definitely do another course with this company."
1,2020-11-03T22:36:14.000Z,My experience with studying through‚Ä¶,"My experience with studying through open colleges has been absolutely ridiculous so far. The portal they use is hard to navigate as there is often broken links throughout all of the modules I have gone through. Most of the assessment questions are very poorly worded and difficult to understand as if the assessors who wrote them hardly proof read their work. When I have asked for help, the response I get often leads to me feeling even more lost. The assessors even seem to struggle explaining the questions and how to go about answering them. More times than not they are no help at all. Even messaging for help with navigation is a joke because the responses I have gotten are abysmal, as if the people answering the question don‚Äôt even know where to find certain things.If I knew the whole experience was going to be like this I never would have signed up, complete waste of time and money."
5,2020-11-03T22:34:16.000Z,The course material is comprehensive and all staff patient and helpful,"The course material, even though extensive reading, is comprehensive and contributes well to the quiz and assessments. the Training Manager is patient and explains articulately what is required, plus communicates well with the Assessors.  The Assessors are also patient and explain until you clearly understand.  The webinars are super helpful and in detail.  Examples are always very helpful and of course, there are exercises to assist along the way. There is no denying Accounting is a difficult course, with financial formulas; hence a Financial calculator is required to purchase and learn!"

Students left to fend for themselves through a portal with broken links and poor communication paths. Just like multiple other students were completely lost and ended up abandoning the course as we could not get help. The teachers couldn't even explain the questions within the first assessment. Worst part is the course is supposed to provide knowledge on how to help members of the community. I wonder how many great people out there this flawed arrangement has turned away from the industryNO REFUND! $4500 spent and not even so much as a phone call to follow up support after nothing submitted. or follow up to see how the course was going. Didn't submit a single assessment and still could not re enrol to start and try again.Genuinely believe some of this is designed to be a scam. Be very careful READ the paperwork you sign.Would be great if the ACCC got to poking around at this system designed for you to fail but they will still take your money.DO NOT GET TRAPPED by the ability to pay the course off - Speak with employer or TAFE/ Learning institute about optionsWriting this not because just I lost over $4000 within this joke of a system but so many others that enrolled in my course and other horror stories in other courses I have heard.

I did not achieve the result I believe I am entitled to.  Time frames were impossible for this request and resulted in me giving up on prior recognition.Some glitches in the quiz areas.I AM STILL WAITING ON MY CERTIFICATE 3 IN DENTAL ASSISTING OF WHICH IS VITAL FOR MY AWAITING EMPLOYMENT.

I appreciate that some assessment units had webinars held for them which went more into detail of how to correctly complete the assessment.Overall I am happy with my experience.

2,2020-10-21T05:10:39.000Z,Great trainer but terribly run college.,"Although I had a wonderful trainer, I was not impressed with the administration of this college. I would leave 1 star if it weren't for the trainer I had.Firstly I went through hell trying to get RPL for a subject I actually teach myself at another college. I could not understand the refusal. The person I was dealing with clearly didn't understand the purpose of RPL.Secondly the student site is extremely user unfriendly. Even Moodle is a better tool. It is really hard to navigate and took ages to find all the resources for my work placement.The multiple choice exams did not reflect the modules and the answers were subjective. I took me several attempts and multiple windows to get through it.They refused to help me with work placement despite being CRICOS approved.Lastly I had to chase up my certificate. I wasn't impressed with COVID being used as an excuse, considering the trainer could manage his workload without any issues.In summary I would not be recommending anyone use open colleges."

3,2020-10-07T07:07:22.000Z,Overassessed and frustrating,"The horticultural course content was worthwhile, detailed and relevant to the current Australian industry. The online resources were well designed and easy to navigate.However, the course assessment schedule was onerous and repetitive and the marking was needlessly pedantic and slow. Too many assessments per subject made for a relentless 49 tasks out of a possible 67 to complete my qualification - surely overkill for a Certificate II.Locking students out of later units was another aggravating practice. This made it difficult to speed up my progress through assessments during periods when I did have extra time available. Adult learners (especially online students) need the flexibilty to control their pace of learning and to see the scope and sequence of upcoming assessments to plan how to fit them in around other commitments.I usually enjoy learning but I found this course degenerated into an unpleasant and frustrating grind through excessive assessment tasks."

It was most certainly real.Assessment feedback was very constructive and focused me on the importance of research and study. For me the Diploma in Community Services was challenging but so rewarding in the long run.The time frame of when you submit an assessment to when you get graded and score is a little long but understandable especially in this uncertain times with COVID.I recommend Rosan (assessor) for some kind of recognition as he was fantastic in regard to prompt replies to emails (even over the weekend) and is very professional in the way he conducted work placement tutorial and tutoring. A wealth of knowledge.Thanks again Open Colleges for the opportunity to  up skill myself and better myself to provide a solid service to all who may need it.CheersDavid Williams

2,2020-09-08T00:49:30.000Z,Track RPL documents via post to avoid disappointment,"Posted RPL documents via Australia Post (due to being hundreds of pages) and lucky I had tracked the document, as Open Colleges would take no responsibility for receiving this, despite Australia Post advising it had been collected. This took more than 3 months to sort out, with each time I called someone promising to call back but never did. It was only after I demanded to speak with the manager that it miraculously appeared on someone's desk, and then having wait another 2 months for the RPL's to be approved, it was an extremely painful process. I would be hesitant to study with Open Colleges again as it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth from my experiences with them."

The support staff are amazing, and help you through every step.The course material is thorough, but could have more varied experiences beyond ReckonOne. A lot of business stuff which was interesting but thought there could be more complex accounting and bookkeeping work as the landscape in the real world changes so often.It was hard to complete whilst working full time, but super interesting work and I loved the flexible nature of the course. The feedback was helpful on assignments, however it would be an incentative to be graded on a scale, not just satisfactory or not."

So its about making money not giving people the opportunity to study with them!Very disappointing,I'm sorry for whoever put this policy in place and make students to pay this amount of money!!"
4,2020-09-06T23:15:26.000Z,Good for fulltime worker,Suitable for busy people who are working full time and can tailor their studying to suit them. Some content was outdated and the placement was very tick boxy-impacting a natural development of skills over the hours required. Staff were nice and supportive and responsive.

I was not advised that I would have to ring and book in times for the assessor.  It was not until I rang near the end of my hours that I rang to find out when someone would be contacting me. I found this process very cumbersome.
1,2020-09-05T10:10:55.000Z,Review,"Hi,As much as I appreciate the concept of online learning and Open Colleges as an institute. This course (Cert III in Fitness) has been the worst educational endeavour I have ever experienced. Firstly, majority of the content that is required to complete had little to no relevance in my placement. This left me questioning the subject matter implemented and I was left wondering why did I have to go through 7 modules of theory just to use maybe 2 modules in my practical work. Further, why was there such an expectation to conduct on such diverse populations? How can you expect students to apply concepts like pre-exercise screenings, training programs and diverse interactions with individuals that are disabled, different faiths or have severe health conditions? What regular gym will allow people with such unfortunate circumstances train without the adequate supervision and help? I had to search and reach out to an abundance of people I knew through prior life experiences just to meet these ridiculous placement standards. Why not just have a list of gyms that accomodate for these individuals and make placements happen there. Secondly, the feedback given by the assessors led to copious amounts of personal frustration. Why were questioned marked as unsatisfactory if one or two words were left out of answers? Why were certain training programs marked as unsatisfactory if they were not quite correct from a textbook perspective, even though, in real life experience have been proven to be effective? It was very frustrating to submit programs that took inspiration from qualified strength and conditioning coaches, just to have them knocked back. Also, why is there such a low expectations of how individuals can train in the gym? Saying statements like four sets of twelve squats is too high volume for a male adolescent looking for hypertrophy? How? Why? Thirdly, the promise of a 10 business day turn around for marking was almost never followed through. For some assessments, I had to wait up to a month and a half for feedback. This led to what I thought would be a six-eight month course turning into around a two-year ordeal. I had peers that completed their certificate III and IV in less time than that. Finally, I'm unsure if this was something stated at the start of the course, but why is there little to no help with the expiry date of the course? My course expired and there the only reason I was allowed a special extension is due to a medical emergency I experienced in the duration of the course. When the course expires, nothing is said or done to help people complete their course? If people pay three grand for the course and don't complete it, does your institute just take the money and send the poor student packing? Sorry, to be so mean-spirited but these experience was so frustrating and I hope no one else goes through the same events I did. However, it is not all doom and gloom, as some of your staff were very nice and helpful. I just think your institute needs to reevaluate your structure, policy and content required to complete."
2,2020-09-04T09:46:21.000Z,Disappointed,"I was very excited to be starting my veterinary nursing certificate and was so happy that I could have a chance to complete it online but I was very disappointed with how the course was set out and didn't get a huge amount of support.It was really difficult to communicate with people that worked at Open Colleges and found it difficult to complete work placement with the paper work and trying to email it off and get a response in a adequate amount of time.I wouldn't recommend this course to friends.As happy as I am that I have now completed my study, I am still quite disappointed."

2,2020-08-27T01:56:49.000Z,There is inconsistency among the‚Ä¶,"There is inconsistency among the grading given by assessors, almost as thought there is no communication among assessors regarding marking standards. One assessor in particular is excessively critical of submitted work and always takes longer than the allowed time to respond to submissions. Once the requested changes were made, a further extended waiting period was endured. Sometimes this would go on for up to 3 resubmissions, with a 3-4 week wait between each submission. The hold ups caused by this assessor caused great stress and caused me not to complete my study in time, and required extensions of my course. After all the resubmission for this assessor, the usual mark achievable was a pass or credit. All other assessors gave distinctions or high distinctions for my work, without requiring any Resubmission. Most markers were very helpful and prompt with their marking and advice, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that one was able to make my study an overwhelmingly negative experience.I also found it very unprofessional that I was assured before signing up, that a 6 month extension would be possible at the end of the course if needed. This turned out not to be true. I had to fight for each extension of two months and only two were granted. This required me to take leave without pay from work, which was most inconvenient, as much time had already been lost from work due to Coronavirus, where, as a casual teacher I received no pay for a 6 week period. Having to take further time off to complete the course before my cut off date has greatly affected my finances and quality of life.I would be very reluctant to recommend Open Colleges to anyone wanting to study and in fact, I am an advocate with first hand experience, against studying with Open Colleges."

Some of the most frustrating aspects of studying online include the lack of interaction, the  slowness of response time by trainers when you need assistance. Some assessments took longer for trainers to assess. Having said this, the feedback was always helpful and focused. Resubmissions are a nightmare to upload and Student Support were unable to assist with this aspect. The coursework itself could have been more engaging. The requirements of the work placement are not clear,  in fact they are very confusing. The responsiveness of trainers to emails and enquiries could be improved."

While I work for an RTO I found it difficult to seek feedback before submitting work like our Trainees are able to do with our Trainer Assessors.

1,2020-08-07T08:16:34.000Z,Terrible experience.,"I have had so many problems with Open Colleges. I also know 7 other people who have studied with them and not one has had a positive experience. The course content changed during my study period. I had completed six modules at that point and when the course changed I had to complete gap assessment for every single module I had already done. Some gap assessments were larger than the original assessment. No extensions were automatically applied at this time, you had to actually ask for it. I got married during my course and stopped studying for six months. They called me up and told me I could have deferred my course which was not an option explained to me before I started studying. There were multiple times where I would call student support and was told different things by different people. Also my friends who were studying the same course as me got told different rules about applying for an extension compared to me. There was zero consistency. I have now been ‚Äúfinished‚Äù my course for six months now. When I thought I had done everything I called student support twice and both times was told that I‚Äôd completed all my assignments and that I was just waiting for my assessors to mark them. Instead I got an email from my assessor saying I‚Äôd missed an assignment. So I completed this. Again I called student support and they told me I should receive my graduation letter within a few days. Instead I got an email from my assessor saying that Open Colleges has lost one of my assignments and that I needed to resubmit it. The email was confusing and mixed up assessment numbers from two different modules. I replied back asking for clarification and have since been waiting for a month for a response. I still have not finished my course but they are also not telling me what I need to do. I would never recommend studying with Open Colleges. The past three years have been tough to get this study done as Open Colleges did not make it easy and it has played a role in my mental health."

I have tried to resolve my issues with Open Colleges, however they refused to call me back and told me via email they would stop responding to my emails. Open Colleges refunded some of my money (over $1,00) but still kept $4,000 from me.Just a little update. I have tried to write feedback on the Open Colleges Facebook page and within 12 hours all my comments/feedback where deleted and I was blocked by Open Colleges. Open Colleges really does not care about their students. Most companies welcome the good and bad feedback...Open Colleges does not and I wonder why? They are trying so hard to hide how horrible they are. Please do not study with Open Colleges EVER!"

1,2020-07-22T00:28:20.000Z,Was I Scammed of my Money to Sign Up?,"I was sold the dream product experience (the Cert 4 in Disability) which claimed to deliver a better experience than a University. I can honestly say that I have been less than impressed from the moment I started the course and nothing of what I was sold came as part of the purchase, but the exact opposite. I believe that my money was taken and I was not delivered what I paid for, which is incredibly disheartening and dissapointing. Anyone who has shown interest in doing their disability studies through Open Colleges I have warned and encouraged to find another provider. The lack of communication from anyone in the teaching team, no apparent course coordinator, wait times of up to 2 months on assignments, promises of credit transfers only to be told 3 months later that they decided against it, content filled with spelling and gramatical errors and hyperlinks which no longer exist, as well as the modules rehashing the same information in different ways has made for a really boring and frustrating experience. My grievances have been brought up to the team via phone and chat throughout the time I have been a student, and I have found out that I am not the only one who feels cheated of their money. If you do decide to study with Open Colleges, I hope your experience was better than mine and others. And for those who have had a very positive experience, I am very happy for you :). Thank you."

More collaboration between the trainer and the student on each module, when you ask a question they are always very superficial. I would have learn how to made Tax Return for a Company and how to better analyze a Financial Statement rather than how to make a Business Plan! It is unecessary for a bookkeeper or for a owner of a company or even for an Accountant because there are company designated to do so...but overall the course was good."
1,2020-06-29T23:32:00.000Z,It was a great start to the course,"It was a great start to the course, Student Support were very helpful however once the course was superseded it was like we didn't exist. Student Support would take weeks sometimes to get back to you. System errors happened frequently but  because they didn't effect all students they didn't bother to tell you. Only having one assessor by the end of it made completing the course in time impossible, requiring you to fork out more money to finish the course. What should have been a 2 year course ended up being a 3 year course because of their incompetence."

3,2020-06-28T21:15:48.000Z,Okay for self learning but they need to give more....,"Studying with open college was good for the most part. You can go at your own pace with no assessment due dates.Some assessors were better than others with response time and had clearer instructions if you had any questions.The only problem is that there isn‚Äôt much resources available for the modules, they would benefit from doing webinars and YouTube videos with examples of the assessment questions for those students that study better when you go through it once. Out of my 13 modules only 3 had any sort of video explanations or webinars and maybe another 3 had additional resources.I also think the marking is a little pretentious and tedious. They would withhold a mark for the smallest details that you then had to fix up and resubmit and wait a while 20 days to get one assessment finally marked. I think they should just bring in pass or fail and not get too caught up in the details of assessment unless you were completely wrong. I think they do this so their average goes up as I‚Äôd be withheld for not putting in formulas for my working out where no where in the assessment does it say to do that and then get a HD or a D?I think if you‚Äôre okay with doing your own research and working through a booklet by yourself with minimal teachings open college is for you"

I find their lessons to be extremely basic and boring. On the back of what they teach I would not hire someone telling me he/she has a certificate from open college as he/she would be incompetent. They are also very dishonest in the way they‚Äôll sign you up not honouring discounts they told you they‚Äôd give you. Their customer service is appalling as they do everything by emails.

4,2020-06-17T00:12:43.000Z,Open Colleges Review,"It was a great experience to go through open colleges. Obviously there are always ups and downs when it comes to studying online. Just a few of the negatives were some assessors/trainers took a long time to get back to an email which can make it hard to continue on. They should not be marking on their personal preference which I had a few people do and that was disappointing, it should not be about what they like and dislike it should be about my design and the areas I have done well and need to improve. This can be quiet upsetting for some people. Some modules need to be updated as at times when I got marked they were telling me to add this and this but it never said anywhere to do that in the assignment. I also found that there was so much reading in the modules and I got lost at times, but some parts were great to read. A lot was repeated.On a positive note, some assessors/trainers were amazing and got back to me within the day or even a few hours which was amazing. Some were really helpful and did not mind how many questions I asked which is good as I ask a lot of questions. I liked not having specific deadlines for assignments as life does get busy so somedays were good to study and some weren't. Whenever I called the study helpline or whoever for help, I had nothing but great people and they were so helpful every time and I was so thankful for that. Overall it was a great time and I have throughout my study recommended at least 3 people to study through Open Colleges and I will continue to do so. Thank you so much for all the support that I got along the way."

I have literally only just been able to pay off the course over a few years and I had to borrow the money to do so. Please do me a favour and don‚Äôt sign up because if you‚Äôre like me and suffer mental health they won‚Äôt give a crap about you and your needs and drain you of your money."

2,2020-06-04T03:11:42.000Z,Not for hands on and practical learners.....,if you are a practical hands on learner then i wouldn't suggest open colleges. It is all online and you really need to have motivation yourself to complete the course...... When you reach out to tutors it would take them a few days to respond ... which doesn't help when you are trying to get help with an assignment. Also reaching out to other students and 'study buddies' no one would ever reply or there isn't a common group to reach out to to get help. It was very hard to complete this course without much support... Im glad i'm done and its over. I believe it would be good if the course had live tutor lessons or lessons teaching you certain things....
3,2020-06-04T00:55:25.000Z,Diploma of Graphic Design,"I liked the course load and the assessments were beneficial. Also, It was easy to access on an iPad or a desktop, which is also handy. That being said i have a few issues listed below.Unlocking modules - when I started the course, only two modules were available, with more being unlocked when an assessment is marked/completed. This is fine - in that it forces you to go through the modules in a linear fashion - but if you are waiting for an assignment to be marked, you're left twiddling your thumbs and you ultimately lose time. I understand the assessors have a lot to do so I don't think any whips need to be cracked. The easiest solution would be for all modules to be unlocked with the exception of the assessments (which is essentially what ended up happening once I phoned for assistance).Updating content - The modules had a lot of relevant information that if found beneficial to the learning process, but a lot needed to be updated to stay relevant. I understand graphic design moves pretty quickly but some of the content was almost superfluous. Case in point would be the module on UI. The software recommended was pencil project, which I don't think is even relevant from an industry standpoint. I understand its free, but so is Figma and XD, both of which are used widely in the industry.Reviewing assessments - I found that there was a lot of ambiguity in the language for the assessments, In that, I would often have to sift through the comments on the assessment page to see if another student had addressed the same problem I was having. Another issue I had was with the level of work that focused on safe work practices, obviously, it's important but I don't think it warranted the amount of attention allotted. I would rather see more coursework on the process of creating.If I could give the course a 3.5 I would because a 3 seems too harsh and I know I wasn't the best student. it just feels like it has the potential to be a lot better, it just needs a bit of a spring clean."

3,2020-06-02T00:28:10.000Z,My overall experience was pretty‚Ä¶ average,"My overall experience was pretty average. When I was thinking about enrolling with Open Colleges, I was getting a number of calls with promises of support. Throughout my whole enrollment I did not receive a support phone call checking in on my progress or if I needed extra support (which I really would have benefited from as I found the independent learning and self motivation hard).When I had to speak to support via phone, for the most part they were pleasant and helpful. However, in my last month of being with Open Colleges I spoke with a consultant (Debra) and she was rather unhelpful, rude and very abrupt. I requested to speak to a manager or faculty representative to discuss my individual concerns, this was denied and I was told ""there is nothing that a faculty member can help you with that I can't."" I needed to do the following up and did not receive a phone call from Debra with my issue, this as a result left me with 1 week to complete my work placement paperwork and log books (which was really unreasonable when working fulltime) I did not receive a call to say that my extension had been denied.I can't fault Rychelle Carmody - she was great throughout the process and had initiative to get in contact with me to discuss work placement, she applied for me to have a one month extension (that was funnily approved 1 week after Debra told me it was denied).Assessment feedback was always clear, however sometimes it did take a while to get a response. Sometimes you had to wait past the 10 day timeframe they gave you. It was difficult to get support on an assessment question quickly.Course content is outdated. If I did not get the opportunity to work and study in the field I would have struggled to complete the assessments with the limited course content I had. I completed a number of my assessments based on hands on experience and guidance from mentors.Overall, I would not recommend the course to anyone who is looking to study online. The course has been lengthy, and the whole process was terrible, it added extra stress on top of an already stressful sector to work in.I am disappointed that the most I heard from Open Colleges in nearly 3 years is when I was getting empty promises of support. The price of the diploma is not worth it, $4885 for a piece of paper that I obtained purely through good mentoring of supervisors and NOT through the support or education from Open Colleges."

2,2020-05-29T22:40:42.000Z,An ordeal I would not care to repeat,"My assessor was as helpful as she could be but I felt like every time I needed support from the college themselves they dragged their feet, particularly with workplace learning. The college promised support in finding a host as a selling point to get my money yet this was not available without first jumping through several hoops. After I had trouble finding a host on my own, I jumped through all their hoops and still never actually received the support they had promised. All up I spent 5 months looking to secure myself a host with zero assistance from the college and at additional cost to myself in paying for an extension to provide myself with reasonable time to get my placement completed, and being told I needed to pay for a police check to satisfy the college's procedures before they could help. They still never contacted me with assistance. This was at least 4 months of course time completely wasted as by that time I had finished the rest of my course work. The experience of dealing with the college was incredibly stressful and soured the whole course experience for me. I would not put myself through Open Colleges again or recommend it to any person who asks."

1,2020-05-21T08:33:12.000Z,Absolutely hopeless,"Absolutely hopeless. They took so long to reply to questions and mark assessments, stopping me from moving on as you can‚Äôt start the next assessment until you have passed the last. I had to continuously ask for extensions because they took so long to reply, this made my course take 18 months to complete where at other places it can take weeks. The assessment questions were often not clear in what it was actually asking you to do. The reading material often had spelling and grammar mistakes or just didn‚Äôt make sense, and links/ attachments put into the modules often didn‚Äôt work. I also have friends who have studied with them that have also had a bad experience. Wouldn‚Äôt even consider studying through them again."

Rosan very supportive and delivered great content during my learning experience. I have found the Open Space platform to be easy to navigate with handy tools. The price for the course was very reasonable for what i recieved and am please to have walked away with career enhancements instantly! Thank You Open Colleges, I am already looking at my next course options!"
1,2020-05-21T07:21:14.000Z,Reporting to Consumer Affairs,"Currently reporting Open Colleges to Consumer Affairs. I signed up for a course earlier this year and was offered a half price ""deal"" if I paid within an allocated amount of days. When i called up to pay about two days out of the allocated agreement time the ""deal"" was off and they now required the amount paid in full. I told the guy over the phone Tom O'Brian i'm pretty sure his name was that there was no way I could afford that amount and asked if I could pay the original amount agreed upon. From there Tom's friendly attitude turned completely inappropriate and almost threatening, I had emails from him at weird times of the night asking for payment. This put an extreme amount of stress on me as I also have a disability which i explained to them at the start and put in my documentation. They asked me to fill out a 'special consideration' form as i wanted out of the service so i submitted all details required including my disability pension (health card card) It got rejected because they required further evidence...what more evidence does a person with a disability need to give!? I now have debt collectors emailing and calling me at all times of the day asking for amounts of up to $4,000. Mind you I never once logged into the course or started any material. I opted out within the first couple of weeks but because it wasn't in the 7 day cooling off period it didn't apply. BE CAREFUL. I have read other peoples stories of them calling to opt out within the 7 day period only to cancel over the phone only to be told they need everything in writing or they will not approve the decision. It is all a scam and an absolute trap, whatever you do to try and get out of this service it is a dead end!! I have no choice but to take the matter further."
5,2020-05-21T02:51:19.000Z,I would recommend Open Colleges,"I would recommend Open Colleges as a great option for studying;- The platform is relatively clear, well presented and logical.- I found the course material to be relevant, interesting and engaging.- I found the lecturers and support staff were always friendly, encouraging and ready to help.- I have always worked better under pressure/ to a deadline so the policy of an 'extra' 6 months helped motivate me to finish it off.If you are willing to put the work in, read instructions, offer a little patience in the processes of lecturers getting back to you (they always got back to me well within timeframes) and accept responsibility for yourself, then Open Colleges might be a great option for you."
1,2020-05-19T09:19:22.000Z,Project Management,"Course studied - Project Management.A few points from my experience:- Pre signing to the course, I was sold the experience of not being left alone during studies and being taken through an orientation upon starting to guide me through setting up study buddies etc. Which is one of the reasons I chose open colleges over other providers. This did not happen I was not contacted once during the entire course unless I messaged my assessor.- I was also told I can extend the course for as long as needed but would have to pay an administration fee which I didn't have an issue with. Also this was not the case when I applied for an extension I was told I had to send a request for approval to be reviewed.- I was also told each module within the course would have an online webinar to go over the learning outcomes of the module, go through what is required for each assessment and answer any questions students may have. This happened for the first module of the course and was very helpful, however this did not happen again. Once again sold a lie.- The content within each module I found quite good and relevant for the education I was after. One area that I feel needs work is the constant role plays, these are hard to organise if you are studying on your own (which I believe most would be considering this is an online at your own pace service)  and don't have anyone to do these with. This delays getting assessments in and considering you are left on your own without being directed to the study buddy service etc. I found ridiculous.- I will finish by saying the assessor I had was fantastic and very helpful when contacted. I do feel they don't have the time to give the service open colleges promises."

Special thanks to Mr. McClatchey, Miss Radford and to the Trainers, who has been very supportive and patient in their assisstance with my course.The one thing I love the most is that I can study on my free time. One thing I have learned is that knowledge is an important factor in moving forward in life.  Dedication and commitment are key factors. My course has helped me move forward in my career.  I still have one module to do but I already have my goal set. To move further, I plan to take Certificate IV in the near future.Thank you Open Colleges!"

They requested a lot of video assessments that require you to ask a friend or family member to help with acting and it is extremely difficult because you don't always have people around to help with ""acting""! They also require bed making video assessment that your bed and linens at home are not suitable. I asked my friends who study with other institutes and they said they didn't have to do video assessment to complete the cert.Their student support is really like a joke. They don't really helpful at all, and they didn't explain about these assessments when you ask and study with them. It is too late to defer and get full refund until you realize this."

3,2020-05-06T22:39:21.000Z,3 STARS,"I gave 3 stars due to the timing of assessments being marked. I was told at the beginning that assessments will be marked within 10 business days. Towards the end of the course, it was taking 3 weeks sometimes and I had to call customer support about it. I even had to ask for an extension that cost me $ just to give them time to mark assessment. Then I had to call regarding my last assessment which had not been marked. I received another extension - free this time thank god. I was not happy about this as I had completed the assessments within the course time frame."
4,2020-05-06T08:33:27.000Z,Very helpful,"Marking was very strict. Failed on minor errors,  sometimes minor spelling errors. Could there be room for this to avoid extra work re-submitting, re- marking & waiting for results. Time could be better spent by assessors  & students to move on.Otherwise everyone was very helpful & always responded quickly to questions & were very thorough. Enjoyed the course a lot. Thank you for the opportunity."
2,2020-05-05T05:56:06.000Z,Course Work Vague. Trainers Unhelpful,The course work was very vague and the trainers could have done a lot more to help out. The assessments often required work that wasn't covered in the course work and the assessments were EXTREMELY vague in what they were actually asking. The trainers would often give feedback explaining what was actually required which is what should have been there from the very start. I wouldn't recommend Open Colleges. I would 100% go through an actual TAFE next time
1,2020-05-05T00:18:38.000Z,Do not study through Open Colleges,If it were possible to give open colleges less than one star I would. If you are considering studying online I highly recommend finding an alternate provider to Open Colleges.Their ‚Äústudent support‚Äù system is the biggest joke I have ever encountered. Do not expect to get a response from their team regarding any issue in less than 30 days. I have waited 4 months to gain a response to a complaint I made with them and to even gain this response required me calling and hammering them with emails to process my complaint. Then after finally getting a response they acknowledged that they were in part in the wrong but could offer no solution and nothing would in fact be resolved.....They want your money and that‚Äôs it. Once they‚Äôve sucked you in good luck getting help with anything.
5,2020-05-04T08:37:37.000Z,Couldn‚Äôt recommend Open colleges enough.,I have completed my certificate 3 in health services assisting and my diploma of Human Resources management with Open colleges. Both times they have been absolutely amazing and helpful. With my diploma I was pregnant and needed many extensions. The course was only 18 months and I did the course in 2.5 and they let me do it to help me out. The Assessors are all lovely and listened to everything I had asked of them and they helped me. I‚Äôm grateful for everything Open colleges has given me in terms of my education and helping me improve my self confidence through learning.
4,2020-05-02T07:02:56.000Z,Assessment Marking Slow.,Assessment Marking Slow.Only complaint is the time to return assessments.  This was not the case when I started this course.

1,2020-04-29T07:07:18.000Z,WORST COLLEGE EVER - DO NOT USE OPEN COLLEGES,"My experience with open colleges has been terrible and I'm going to take them to court. DO NOT GO WITH THEM, THEY'RE JUST AFTER YOUR MONEY! THEY WORK ON KPI's! Once they have your money they do not care about you and you have no hope in getting it back. They will do everything in their power to not refund you.*They were very pushy and got me to enrol even though I told them I had commitments, I was going away and visiting my family. I told them this and I wouldn't be able to start the course until after I got back, so it was after the cooling off period.*When I looked over the course there was soo many spelling and punctuation errors, as well as broken links and outdated course material.* Due to severe health issues I wasn't even able to start the course, so I applied for special consideration and I wasn't given a full refund. The special consideration is an absolute lie. They're keeping over $700 of my partners money for no good reason. The cancellation fee is only $100 what is the other $600 for? I didn't need materials. I didn't even start the course, only looked over it!* They are so rude and ignore all your emails* Also they're no longer a member of the resolution institute mediation scheme and when they do reply they keep saying to appeal through them for an external investigation even though they're no longer members!! So that's a joke.* I was also given false information by them. What ever you do. Stay a long way away from this company and go through TAFE !!"
5,2020-04-29T02:21:58.000Z,Certificate IV in Bookkeeping and Accounting,"This was my first time pursuing an online course so I was unsure what to expect. I chose Open Colleges for the Certificate IV in Bookkeeping and Accounting as it was the best way to gain the appropriate qualifications to register as a BAS Agent. I was challenged with the course as I had hoped to be, and the trainers and assessors were always a quick email away to answer any questions with very helpful advise whenever I got stuck. Student support were always amazing and made life so much easier. I recommend Open Colleges to anyone who is motivated and looking for a great balance of work/study/life."
2,2020-04-29T00:02:06.000Z,Not that impressed.,"1.  The enrolment process was a nightmare.  Turns out the guy who initially took my enquiry left and didn't tell anyone.2.

They have been able to answer my queries very promptly and always provide valuable feedback on my assessments. When I was stuck, they were always a quick email / chat away to help me with my queries.My only issue was with the very in-dept tasks at a Cert III level for Work placement. I found that 120 hours was not enough to complete all the tasks and try to gain industry experience in the role, not to mention added pressure of having to complete 3 other modules during the placement. Apart from this, everything else was perfect and would definitely recommend Open Colleges for anyone looking to get their Cert III in early childhood education and care! Thank you Team!!!! :)"
4,2020-04-28T04:35:49.000Z,Great Experience,Great Experience. I just wish that the course would be marked faster and that it was easier to communicate.

Dedicated Educator guides you through out the course when needed. Detailed material is provided for the course. Recon One Software is very informative and easy to use for assessments. Just in case you cannot complete the course in time due to various reasons, Open colleges give you an option to extend which gives peace of mind. Thanks to Open Colleges for adding more to my knowledge."

1,2020-04-23T03:08:10.000Z,Steer clear if studying Cert IV in Bookkeeping,"If you are interested in doing a Cert IV in Bookkeepping, I would not recommend this RTO at all. I was advised incorrectly of their RPL process and I was completely misled. There are other RTO's that I have spoken to that have an RPL process that is actually achievable. My course trainer only spoke in circles with no real to help. The course itself is so outdated with the information they teach (businesses have not operated this way for years). This course will not actually equip you with the skills to be a bookkeeper without strict supervision from an experienced bookkeeper/accountant. I feel I have wasted $4,000 on a course that I will not be able to finish even though I have 15 years experience in the field that I am ""studying""."

1,2020-04-22T18:47:06.000Z,The BIGGEST MISTAKE you can make!,"This is one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to enrol with Open Colleges for the dual Diploma in Marketing/ Social Media course. It's not only badly structured learning on the online platform with little to no learning support (they have a student Facebook group and that's what is what will be your main learning support is other students who are doing the course doubling up as peer tutors) but their student advisors have no educational teaching or teaching support staff experience, they are sales people, therefore, they‚Äôre agenda I‚Äôve unfortunately learnt is focused on signing you up and paying for the course. When problems pop up unexpectedly due to hardship, they will not help you even when circumstantial evidence  is provided by higher authority... they will ignore it and keep saying it‚Äôs insufficient even though it was them that requested such things.They‚Äôre financial focused and do not care about the wellbeing or feedback of their students. They offer no real help when special circumstances are brought up. From my experience they use delaying and confusing tactics, give vague instructions, they will not tell you what you need to do as a student for your case until it's too late.Don't bother with Open Colleges, find a better more reputable college like Tafe or private college who are willing to speak about the actual course with the actual teachers/ department teaching the course and deal with them directly not like Open Colleges who are just sales people worried about their KPI‚Äôs and bonuses.These courses by Open Colleges are money-grabbing corporate driven schemes to attract people at their most vulnerable, they speak to you in an understanding empathetic way, but it‚Äôs ALL FAKE they do this just to sign you up.They play on the emotions of the most trusting and desperate. I had to learn the awfully hard way and lost thousands of dollars, along with a lot of sleep and loss of self worth (it took a while to actually tap in my naive mind that these people actually didn‚Äôt care about my education). For a long time I became too afraid to constantly try and push for fair guidance/ outcomes. I got neither when I did try. It just made me more depressed and anxious each time I approached them for help, constantly dealing with different staff but each time like they fed me the same lines and tried to make me believe they went above and beyond when in truth it didn‚Äôt matter to them at all, they already predetermined the resolution before the advisor knew the details of the personal circumstances or before you reply to the question I was constantly ask, ‚Äúwhat do I want for my learning/ course outcome‚Äù...applications for extensions and or special circumstances.I reiterate, they will do anything to get you to sign up and will do anything to retain your money regardless of the questionable ethical standards. Save your money and a lot of disappointment and DON‚ÄôT get suckered in by their sales team... what sounds too good to be true, is in this case."

2,2020-04-22T02:38:00.000Z,Certificate IV in Accounting and Bookkeeping,"Unfortunately this course has been a complete waste of my time and money. The support was lacking in that it took a long time for questions to be answered along the way sometimes, and because of a change to the course (started out with learning MYOB and then the course changed to Reckon, which businesses don‚Äôt use!!!) finding employment is now difficult, because I don‚Äôt have experience in MYOB or XERO (which is what employers are looking for), meaning I now need to further study.

She tried to email multiple people multiple times and the only reply didn't even adress the issue. Now she's facing an additional fee as she ""didn't complete the course in time."" She's here, she's ready to learn. It's hard enough mentally and financially for a single mother to take this mission on, the least you could do is provide the service you're charging people for."

The trainers, assessors and student support team were always very quick and friendly to respond to my questions and queries, which made completing the learning modules and assessments a very pleasant experience.I hope your online journey with Open Colleges can be as good as mine!"

One assessment I submitted. Got told to resubmit.  I changed a couple of words and then got a credit. Waste of time. Trainers are barely qualified. Most had below the diploma I was attaining and a certificate 4 workplace assessment and training. Insulting really.Student services were a joke.

Being a full-time mum and working, time management was the key but towards the end it became easier as you settle into the course and find your way around the sites, programs and stop making more work for yourself. Being remote meant we had times of technological issues which really made it hard but over all I am happy with my choice and would do it all over again! I know my course will get used, I loved my placement and work has been offered to me. I feel very proud of myself and recommend any one to get a course behind them especially mum's like me getting back into work after children and looking at a new direction we all deserve and can accomplish  anything we put our mind to! Happy Studying!"

I was worried that I would not be supported if I found my studies to be too challenging.The assessors/trainers were very encouraging & usually replied to any course related queries within 24 hours. It also challenged me to problem-solve myself before going to the trainers for assistance. Most of the time, I was able to work things out for myself or look things up in Google.The course material was very thorough.I would highly recommend Open Colleges if you're thinking of doing online study."

Do not waste time with tribunals they get no where. I cannot understand how this company still is allowed to run as a registered RTO. If the student resolution team asks you to contact them on here I wouldn't bother either you will get no where. Take it to a formal court room."

The assessments had spelling and grammatical errors sometimes to the point that the question didn't make sense, considering I was completing a course in Speech Assistance this was extremely disappointing. Whenever support was needed it would take days to get a reply, I often found there was no assistance from staff members over the phone due to a lack of knowledge even when regarding my account details rather than the course itself. Also the ""chat online"" services were never available even through the ""opening hours"". Overall I'm really upset that I spent thousands of dollars for a piece of paper with information I could have learned on the internet."

1,2020-03-30T14:08:24.000Z,"Not recommended - poor support, inconsistent","I would not recommend studying with this organisation. Student support is virtually nonexistent. The course I completed required placement and it took me over a year to secure somewhere to do this. I asked for help from OC as was one of the attractive features of the course and it resulted in nothing. Ultimately, I just had to keep applying on my own until I found a place which had availability to allow me to complete placement. Because of this delay, I was then told that I would not be able to complete my course (as no more extensions would be provided) and so I would receive a statement of attainment for what I had completed to date. This isn't entirely OCs issue, I had some health problems which made completion of placement impossible for around 6 months. I take ownership of that as something which is totally on me.Course materials were often outdated and assessment material was poorly written or worded, making it difficult to determine exactly what the assessors were looking for you to demonstrate. Turnaround time on assessments and exams also left a lot to be desired. It would often take several weeks for results to be returned. This also meant you often got stuck waiting for your next module to be released.Feedback from assessors was also incredibly inconsistent. I was told on one exam that I was providing too much information, and then marked down on the next one for not providing enough detail. This happened repeatedly and when I asked about why the feedback on my exams was so vastly different in terms of what was actually required I didn't get a response.It was a really disappointing experience all round. It honestly just feels like as soon as they take your money, you don't matter in the slightest."

The textbook was very useful, and the online material was pitched to the correct level, and the diagrams very helpful. The information was easy to read and follow and the additional resources quite useful.  I found the videos very helpful, I would love to see even more of them!! (And the background music was very catchy!)The staff were amazing. Lucas Bendt really assisted me as I was having trouble uploading the videos on the OpenColleges assessment page, and very quickly downloaded my videos via the Wetransfer app.Michael gave useful feedback, was quick to mark assignments and even personally contacted me to check on my progesss and offer support with the Workplace Projects.The only negative experience I had was while trying to upload videos. I don‚Äôt have very good internet reception. so when it cuts out the videos that are in the process of uploading don‚Äôt get saved as I go until I press submit and therefore I have to begin the uploading process all over again. And a lot of videos would not upload due to file size or format, despite me making the videos as short and low resolution as I could.But the staff were very accommodating in letting me send my files via another method so only a small issue really.

Now I want to finish my diploma and they wouldn't let me unless I start from beginning even though the lecturer said to me to finish my last block and that I wouldn't have to repeat these units ever again. Stay away from Open Colleges and go to TAFE they are much more professional and organised. Open Colleges lectures consist of youtube videos you can watch at home and 80% of the course content must be done by you anyway researching internet and learning yourself. The equipment in the lab isn't working and you have one poor lecturer trying to teach 30+ people, so all you do is waiting all day for your turn. They have 2 days of study which they classify as full time. Tafe on the other hand have the same course but 4 full days or you can do it part time in 2 full days so you will learn way more and properly. Don't waste your time like me! They wouldn't even offer any re entry exam to test your skills they just make you to do everything from beginning!!!They spend ridiculous amount of money on marketing and close to zero on working equipment in labs."

Turn around time for assessor to get assessments back really affects the two year original limit for learning which put extra stress on ability to learn comfortably.

Firstly they transitioned the course RIGHT after i started, forcing me to do gap assessments instead of advising me to wait until it was transitioned over. Such a long turn around for a reply when reaching out to trainers and assessors about coursework. Content throughout the course was often not updated with links not being available. Many grammatical errors and information errors. The assessor I had missed my appointment multiple times that I had booked off work for, so wasted my time and effected my finances. The wait time for anything whether it be a response to a query or having Assignments marked or waiting for replies was far too long. Some of my assignments were marked unsatisfactory just because the assessor didn't read or look properly at the submission. Big gap between student support and assessing team meant that I never received correct information. After I finally got my assessor to complete the final interview for my SSIQ after doing nothing for a month, they then left me waiting again. Then after it was finally completed they said my certificate would arrive shortly. This was told to me by my assessor and also in email, after 10 days still no certificate. I touch base with student support only to be told it will take 6-8wks. Definitely not the 10 days or ""shortly"" I was assured of. Disappointing experience. I work full time and studied and basically did it all alone as i realised quickly how little help Open Colleges staff actually were. They could not handle the requirements or demands of the qualification. Definitely felt like they just want your money and then forget about you, I don't even know what all the money I paid went to. The website and content isn't even done well. You think they would at least make sure the content was available with working hyperlinks etc.Would not recommend doing a course through Open colleges.

By learning the modules of the course this has allowed me to transition smoothly into my career change in dealer estate. I strongly recommend open colleges to anyone looking to further their education !!"
3,2020-03-03T21:54:04.000Z,Aged Care Course,"The teachers were good and very friendly, it was just a frustrating experience to have the course finish date pushed back because of teachers leaving. I feel like it should be their responsibility to always ensure an educator is available so that classes don't fall behind on their schedule."
2,2020-03-03T21:50:04.000Z,Early childhood education and care,"My course that was suppose to be 1.5 to 2 years ended up being 4 and my teachers from advanced diplomas couldn‚Äôt answer or help me with questions as wasn‚Äôt it relevant to my study. Poor marking efforts. Having one assignment marked and getting it passed, then they changed assessors  making me do it all again. Making me do 8-9 weeks in total of non paid living away work experience was disgusting on your behalf. Will not recommend this to anyone."
1,2020-03-03T06:00:43.000Z,DON'T DO IT,"Better off studying with Tafe and more trusted avenues. my experience was horrible I paid way too much for something I never got, because their units and site is full of crap. I've studied many qualifications by far this was the worst.I tried multiple times to complete assignments contact teacher for support, I got nothing... these fake money scamming fk tards and liars."
1,2020-03-03T04:49:55.000Z,"Just criminals, no compassion or care at all, no morals","Started my course in around June this year, however due to unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, I was unable to complete or continue course. I only managed the first quiz, never used support team etc. I have an Bachelors degree and wanted to progress in study further, however the strain of this was too much.I completed a Special Circumstances Form along with my Protection Order and supporting documentation. They said I can drop out but need to pay the full cost of the course out. No options to transfer money to another course after some time. No compassion or care at all, no real beliefs or morals in helping people to achieve their study. Just criminals, do not waste your money and time in this company."
5,2020-03-03T02:05:54.000Z,An Exceptional Experience,"I enjoyed the flexibility OC offered to me and my family when we chose to travel, gave me the opportunity for new experiences.My trainers and assessors have elevated the course to exceptional standards and were helpful through the challenges I was facing personal and otherwise. I am forever appreciative of them.To the amazing support team who were always available when I had a question or had issues while out on practicals, you were amazing."
4,2020-03-02T23:12:35.000Z,Helpful tutors and student support,The college was very helpful with extenstions that i required for various reasons.Assignments were often long and the final portfolios during work placement were also detailed and comprehensive. Role plays that are included in the final exam were not as intimidating as I had expected and the tutor was encouraging and gave helpful feedback.
1,2020-03-02T22:50:21.000Z,Never again.,This is the worst studying experience to date. Wouldn‚Äôt get responses for months! Wouldn‚Äôt get clear communication on what was happening with anything. Had to constantly call and chase. Wasn‚Äôt until I asked to make a formal complaint that I got a response. This was 4 months later!My advice study anywhere else but Open colleges.
3,2020-03-02T10:00:51.000Z,Room for improvement,"Throughout the Modules some hyperlinks don't work, and it also has spelling and grammar mistakes.If you worked full time and had a family it will be very difficult to complete the course within the 12 months allocated.The video assessments are very involved and will require other people to assist on occasion. They also require more time than indicated to provide and show all the information the students are expected to give. Meaning that often information gets prioritised and discussed but not necessarily demonstrated, and then you have to resubmit video assessments in order to show you carrying out that activity instead of just detailing it."
1,2020-03-02T08:08:07.000Z,Endeavour from hell,"I believe a lot of people are attracted to Open Colleges as they offer payment plans. They're incredibly attentive when selling the course, however rest assured that this contact will cease as soon as you've signed the bottom line. I study at university full time, and work part time. This certificate III in individual support was just to gain industry experience for my Masters program and unfortunately, it turned out to be the endeavour from hell.There are major issues with course content, assessments, student support, teaching support, and placements. Student support via a ""live chat"" do not help with assignment-related queries (rendering them mostly useless). Instead, you must message a ""tutor"" and wait any number of days for a response. Learning materials offer surface-level learning with masses of written content. Sometimes, they'll have taken a youtube video from somewhere and added it to their content, but more often than not, these external sources are 'broken'. In response to such and other content issues relating directly to assignments, I was told to ""google it"".The assessment items are incredibly dull and repetitive, and they do not promote an effective learning style. Once you have submitted an assignment, you're meant to have your marks within 10 business days. This is NOT the case. Marking can take up to 6 weeks. You'll get your grade back and, in some cases, the result was unsatisfactory because I had mistyped my student number or name. So, I'd fix the error, re-submit it, and then have to wait another 2-6 weeks for it to be approved.These abhorrent delays, combined with the pathetic content, have you wondering from the very start where the thousands of dollars each student is paying is going. Furthermore, the delays mean that you are then very unlikely to be able to complete your assessment items within the mandated time period to complete the course. Therefore, many students find themselves having to pay anywhere up to $600AUd for an extension of up to 6 months. If that still isn't enough (for many, it's not), your course will be closed, your money will not be refunded, and you will be left with nothing and thousands out of pocket.I particularly warn anyone who is going to be doing a course that requires industry placement. Many places (and, you can't blame them), do not take students from Open Colleges. I found this out the hard way after spending 3 months applying for placements. The colleges says that it helps with finding placement. It doesn't. They'll send you a form with hints and tips about how to make phone calls and write a resume. They do not have preferred providers in many or any areas-- so you're completely on your own. I found my placement through distant nepotism. Due to the nature of the course, I began my placement completely under-prepared but was lucky enough to have a wonderful supervisor who showed me the ropes.I could go on, with pages of documented issues I've had during my course-- but, I don't want to waste any more energy on this pathetic organisation. What I do want to do is to warn absolutely everyone and anyone I can not to study here under any circumstance."
1,2020-03-02T06:19:10.000Z,Marking assessments very slow,"Marking assessments very slow, you gonna make a thousands of calls before your assessor gonna mark your assessments, you will keep emailing all the time you would never get reply, that what i have been through with open colleges before getting my certificate, but hopefully they would change their ways to make it better"
5,2020-03-02T00:41:27.000Z,Open collegues was a beautiful‚Ä¶,Open collegues was a beautiful experience to improve my knowledge and skills in Human Resources to return to work since being the mother of two girls.The knowledge was professional and personal because I had to improve my habits to achieve the discipline necessary to achieve daily student objectives.Thank you very much Open Collegue for all your support and teaching in my professional career. You are excellent
2,2020-03-01T22:14:07.000Z,Would not recommend,"From the admin/Student Support through time the course and the setup within the online system, I would absolutely not recommend Open Colleges.The Student Support don‚Äôt follow through with any enquires and I had to ring multiple times just to get anything done. They make you jump through lots of red tape to do anything. Often, I would ask about something simple to be sent and it would be promised to me within a couple of days. More than a week later and it still wasn‚Äôt done. I‚Äôd call again to follow up. Same process. Can take weeks to get what you are asking for. Sometimes months.The course setup on the site was hard to read and reference as you have to go to a new page each topic. Having to search through all of the pages to find where a small paragraph of text was frustrating.Communicating with the assessors is useless as it can take a few days between each correspondence for the assessor to respond. This means it can take up to 2 weeks for 4 or 5 back and forth questions rendering their assistance almost useless.The course itself had multiple spelling and grammar errors. For any teaching references, spelling and grammar errors are just unacceptable.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Open Colleges to anyone. Let alone the course. Both the system and support were not student oriented."
5,2020-03-01T08:46:44.000Z,Happy student üòâ,"A friend recommended open collages to me, she studied and qualified through Open Collages.and working fulltime now as Teachers Aid.To be honest i was a bit sceptic about online studying, and did.nt study for many years. I was always use to a class setup. I called Open Collages and never looked back since.. The lady that interviewed me were very helpfull and friendly. She explained everything step by step very well, as i realy did needing all the help i can get. The Open Collages setup ( profile ) page were a big help aswell, its professionally done and with a BIG smile user friendly. Your profile, modules and feedback area to assessors is well done.As english is my second language i need all the help and information i can get. And Open Collages nailed it. Everyone that are interested,don.t be put down by the negative reviews. Thank you Open Collages for giving  thousands of students this opportunity to study and reach their goals"
3,2020-02-28T18:09:39.000Z,Newbie,Im new to OC but been reading heaps of bad reviews.. i just hope my decision is correct in enrolling through them. Hope all students get the support they need. We wll need esp for workplacement.
1,2020-02-28T09:52:20.000Z,$$$$ They want your money,Seeking legal HELPWould not recommend them to anyone!Told people and family about them!
1,2020-03-04T03:39:22.000Z,Dreadful experience,"Dreadful experience. Course had to be extended since it took up to two months to get each module back, and they won't open up the next one. Currently have a complaint registered for 6 weeks with zero response.Locked out of the course, even though everything has been submitted.Currently $3000 down for nothing.Can't believe TAFE put us on to them.STAY CLEARLook at the response to my review: please reach out to student support? Did you not read that I have a complaint registered with you with no response for six weeks? Typical standard response with no intent of rectifying a problem."
2,2020-02-28T01:24:18.000Z,Trainers SLOW to respond when providing assistance,"I was s student for 24 months with dual certificate 4 Leadership Management + Business Administration.During this time I found it extremely difficult to reach trainers and get useful direction or coaching from them - this is often reflected in many of the student discussion boards within the OpenSpace platform.The only way trainers are contactable is through messages in the OpenSpace platform - the response often came a number of days after I needed assistance which in turn resulted in my study/learning being broken while I wait for a reply.If I did send a message through the OpenSpace platform - I had to log back in just to check whether I had a reply as there is no email notifications sent to students when a grade or a reply is sent back - again this causes a long break in my study/learning just waiting for assistance.To improve:I would recommend offering students a 'live chat' options where trainers can be asked a question and an answer given immediately, Maybe have set times where a trainer is available and online to do so - Similar to a online webinar where students can chat and discuss with the trainers their questions.Also developing an email notification system to notify students when a reply or grade has been received in the OpenSpace platform to avoid logging in multiple times just to check for a response - again this wasted time."
1,2020-02-27T14:04:21.000Z,I signed up for a course and cancelled‚Ä¶,I signed up for a course and cancelled within the cooling off period which by the way is only 7 days.  1 month later I realise I am still being charged for the course.  I call open colleges and am assured my course is cancelled.  I am once again charged.  I call for the third time and find out the first two times nothing was done and after 7 days I will no longer be debited.  Today which is 8 days after that call I contact the debit company who have heard nothing from open colleges.  Here we go again this time I have been told 10 business days.  Stay far far away from open colleges all they want is your money.
1,2020-02-27T10:23:11.000Z,a nightmare...go elsewhere,"I studied Cert.IV Interior Design  but got in contact with Diploma students, as well, and the experience is terrible for everybody. I would rate the content a 2/10. Dated, 90%broken links, shallow. Google was my best friend!The assessments were very thorough and also confusing in the way requirements were formulated. The requirements list is 10-20 pages per assessment and the assessors are tough & not briefed on the course content.The whole experience felt like being in Year 2 of school, learning from a KG book but having to pass NAPLAN exams for Year 5.My submitted assessments were always around 50-60 pages. That will say something about the needed amount of work ( definitely not 8hrs/week as OC claims)!Talking about help and academic support: FORGET IT! OC has a Student Support team which is very active but CANNOT OFFER ACADEMIC SUPPORT. OC Student Support helps with admin issues only (access to your course content or course extensions). Students Forum- presented as an option - is actually dead ( nobody there)! The academic support comes from your assessor only. It is vague and sometimes it doesn't come at all ( depending on the assessor). Grading was also inconsistent depending on the assessor's experience:  the less experienced, the worse your grading without proper feedback.It would be interesting to know how many students actually graduate with OC? I bet, not even half! I met so many on social media! They feel hopeless and discouraged.Luckily, I have two bachelor degrees ( one in campus and one in distance learning), and a couple of international certifications (heavy stuff) some done in campus, others online. I experienced different styles of learning in Australia and Europe so I can confidently say: it's not students'fault but Open Colleges'...I enrolled in this course because Interior Design was my hobby and I was hoping I could learn the science behind my skill and start my interior design business. I graduated but I do not feel I learned much! It was an epic waste of time and money!I am trying to find a reason why someone would enroll in these OC courses:a) knowledge? - No, you learn more from books, magazines, online articles and reality shows ( Google was my best friend when looking for answers to my design dilemmas.. why pay $6,500-$10, 000 for that?)b) accreditation? - Well, DIA does not back it up, but the course is still accredited by the Australian Department of Education. However, OC Cert IV and Diplomas are not well regarded in certain states (e.g. WA) so the only jobs for you will be in retail -kind of dead end. Self-employed? You don't need that piece of paper anyway...If you really want to learn, forget about accreditation, look for practical courses that actually teach you something! There are a couple, much cheaper, online. Otherwise, if you want accreditation go with a local TAFE/University. Our local TAFE charges less than OC for a Diploma in Interior Design...Please read more reviews on Product Review as they have more in depth explanations of various experiences.**OC officially changed their course since I graduated but students who transitioned say the content is still the same while assessments are even tougher and longer!"
4,2020-02-27T01:56:19.000Z,The online experience was very easy to use.,"The online experience was very easy to use, having everything accessible in one place made it easy to navigate assessments. The assessor left good feedback on assignment that I did that were encouraging and helpful if I needed to make any corrections. On my last assessment I received a audio feedback from a assessor which for me made it easy to understand how to fix up answers. The only suggestion I won‚Äôt make to improve the website would be as assessments are completed they get checked off or highlighted as they are done."
5,2020-02-26T23:04:03.000Z,my first attempt on online study,It was my first attempt on online study.  I was a little apprehensive at first as I have always been hands on face to face classroom study. To my surprise studying online exceeded my expectations.Having study buddies and others in same situation as yourself.  The online assessors and facilitators have been extremely supporting and always responding to any questions or concerns.It took me 12 months to complete my course and I am very proud at my age in early 50s able to attain a certification.Thank you open colleges.  I definitely recommend and would enroll in another if need be in future
4,2020-02-26T07:22:08.000Z,I liked every bit of my course,"I liked every bit of my course, the courseware was basically an essentials guide to preform well in my daily job and covered most areas in my field in detail. I would highly recommend OC's for any online study and enjoyed the online the flexibility."
1,2020-02-25T06:09:34.000Z,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Open Colleges! The contents of the course is outdated by many years! That‚Äôs also many mistakes on the units plus many resources that doesn‚Äôt work! I called support countless time and they never had a solution!

For the last two years, I studied my Diploma in Early Childhood Education and Care and it was an honour to be one of the Open Collage students. The OpenSpace is very easy to access from laptop or mob. You can easily check your messages, results and contact your trainer and assessor. The assessors and trainer are always available to reply to your message and enquiries. I liked the assessment helper which gave me clues to finish my assessment quicker than usual.Thank you OPen Collage!"

1,2020-02-21T20:06:06.000Z,Absolutely terrible experience overall,"Absolutely terrible experience overall. They are unorganised, incredibly slow to reply (often they don‚Äôt reply at all), I had to call several times for the same thing as they kept telling me they would email me the following day but never did. I was given incorrect information about the expectation of the course several times. Highly recommend going elsewhere regardless of your situation. This one is not worth it"

Student Support is non existent and god help you if you happen to have a Special Circumstance arise. Run in to some difficulties and need an extension It's going to cost you $$$. Do your self a huge favour and contact your local Tafe.
1,2020-02-21T02:17:17.000Z,MY HUGEST REGRET!!!,"I would NEVER recommend Open Colleges to anyone!The course I begun had so much irrelevant information, and assignments that were confusing to understand. The marking period took at times WEEKS, and feedback from Teachers was painfully slow and put a huge halt to progressing on the course.My husband was making the payments for this course ( as I am a stay at home Mum of 5 children, and also Homeschool) and he got so frustrated with the whole process he stopped making the payments and my course was obviously suspended.But rather than being happy with the money they had already received, OPEN COLLEGES have now slammed me with a $2800 debt, and handed this onto debt collectors, threatening us with court!!I do NOT have the money to pay them back at all and we have some huge debts at the moment, including funeral and cremation costs as we just lost my Mum. This has been a devastating bill to out family. This will now affect my credit rating, all over such a greedy company.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! SIMPLY MONEY HUNGRY!!"
4,2020-02-21T00:55:43.000Z,I enjoyed my course,Open colleges gets a bad wrap for all the wrong reasons.If you are self motivated and task driven this company is great. The website is well laid out and assignments are pretty straight forward. There was a couple of technical errors throughout my enrolment but nothing of major concern. Overall my assesors were really cool and easy to talk to and happy to help me whenever i needed and the fact that everything was online and i could complete my placement at my current place of employment made the whole experience super convenient. Sad to see that you are no longer providing animal courses otherwise i'd be enrolling again straight away.
4,2020-02-21T00:22:16.000Z,While the course information was‚Ä¶,"While the course information was relevant and easy to follow, the 'other resources' were jumbled and hard to find and that there isn't a lot of support if you do have questions and need help. Sometimes some online tutoring would have gone a long way in helping to understand some of the topics especially with assessments. There really isn't any encouragement or opportunity to create study groups which again would help with support."

4,2020-02-19T01:26:35.000Z,Diploma of Social Media Marketing,Open Space is an easy to use online platform with a fairly active student support system. Course was very manageable and instructive and I would recommend Open Colleges as a great institution for furthering your education.
5,2020-02-19T00:34:24.000Z,Overall very good,"The Diploma of Counselling through Open Colleges was perfect for my needs as a full-time worker. I found the content to be broad and deep for a diploma level, and the trainers were knowledgable and helpful. Special mention to Alex Nicol for his outstanding feedback and guidance where needed."

It helped me understand what was required of me and how to do my job thoroughly and with confidence.The lecturers were very helpful, thank you Paul Gonzales and Rosalie Pellew for being so patient with me and the help that you gave me. This has been a pleasant yet sometimes a stressful experience which I have enjoyed."
1,2020-02-19T06:26:52.000Z,Do NOT recommend,"I have been waiting and waiting for them to communicate with me, keep being promised they will get in contact and they don't.I enrolled to to the Diploma of Marketing and Communications and took some time off while pregnant due to severe morning sickness. Have since resumed and completed my SOA with them, but they wont grant me access to the rest of course as it is no longer on offer and been transferred to TAFE NSW... which is fair enough, but I should be entitled to a refund and they just keep avoiding me when I call or email.SO A BIG THUMBS DOWN ON CUSTOMER SERVICE!The content also a big thumbs down.... none of the content is their own, they simply point you to external videos and articles I could probably find myself. The assessments are not well written and the feedback you get from assessors is VERY vague and poor. AVOID AT ALL COST! I highly recommend going else where for your training.EDIT - in response to their reply. I have called and emailed several times and STILL I do not get a response just that someone will get back to me... yet they never do"
4,2020-02-18T01:11:44.000Z,The only thing I would suggest is‚Ä¶,"The only thing I would suggest is letting students know months/weeks before their end date to let them know which assignments are outstanding.I was notified in December that only module 7 was outstanding but then 2 months later they figured out that one more assignment in module 5 was outstanding too, which was frustrating to me cause I should‚Äôve been notified about both modules in December to begin with.Other than that student support have been friendly and helpful."
5,2020-02-16T02:29:07.000Z,Positive environment,"Professional, approachable, positive teachers. As long as you are willing to learn for couple of hours every day it‚Äôs very achievable and also affordable. Thank you Open College for helping me become a confident and competent nurse."
3,2020-02-14T09:07:13.000Z,I am very happy I completed my Diploma,"I am very happy I completed my Diploma, it started out well enough but the Portfolio's were quite a challenge, they were huge pieces of work and I would have done better doing 3 days a week rather than 5 and completing the work as I went.  There was a significant lag in time making appointments for Check-ins. Some of the Modules seemed to repeat themselves especially the Supplementary Portfolio. The live interviews consumed precious time and had no practical application. What would've helped is being being able to listen in on educator/parent conversations. The feedback on assessments was always positive and constructive and emailed questions were replied to promptly."
4,2020-02-13T18:06:49.000Z,Online Learning - can‚Äôt really be completed individually,"There was a lot of helpful sites and videos to watch throughout the learning material, however the actual assessments had very little instructions. I found they were too vague and I often wasn‚Äôt sure if what was requested would fit within the word count allocations. For someone who doesn‚Äôt want to have to ask questions and wait 3 days for responses, it would be ideal if the writing was either more clear or there were more webinars. The power point presentations weren‚Äôt more in debt, most of the time they just were recording the assessments word for word.I had about 66% of assessors respond quickly - Holly being the most helpful by the way!I think the biggest thing that should be made clear to students before starting the course, is that you will need someone to take part in your learning for nearly 30% of the course with audio and video recordings. It can be quite difficult for people who are on the move to get other people organised to take part. Perhaps assessors should line up for 5-10 minute discussions - oral quizzes might be a better demonstration of learning for each module.Overall I would say it is very important to try and give yourself time to complete an online course as not all responses can be quick as online media is designed for. The course does provide a lot of useful information to point you in a direction for an area where you would like to focus more time on. It is definitely a very broad Diploma of business, I would have liked to see more financial discussions throughout - something more specific and detailed to thoroughly understand budgeting financials, such as wages, income, expenses. Maybe a breakdown of a week at a restaurant or store would be a good example.Thanks for the learning material, but I strongly recommend more webinars and less interaction required from family and friends to take part in our individual learning."
5,2020-02-13T05:23:10.000Z,Excellent learning organizational.,
4,2020-02-13T01:05:51.000Z,"Great option for study, user friendly and relevant material","I enjoyed my course with Open Colleges, I found the material very relevant to the industry today and the course provided some excellent resources.The Open Colleges portal and systems were user friendly, however I did feel there were areas regarding communication with tutors and support which lacked timely attentiveness when I started.I felt this was over come with the introduction of the online chat option and responsiveness increased with the marking and tutor engagement towards the last 8months."

1,2020-02-11T03:09:21.000Z,WORST COLLEGE EVER....,WORST COLLEGE EVER....all they care about are the payments. They don't suport students and they reply very late. I have huge financial issues now because of them and i also developed huge anxiety and stress. If they don't refund me i will take it to court. I can't even complete the first module because the assessments are so confusing and unclear. They don't help out with the questions and the people who answer me are not professionals. DO NOT STUDY WITH THEM. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY

If you have any life-changing issues making it difficult to study and require deferral or cancellation, they will not help! they won't refund the course components you haven't had access too! Absolutely appalling I'm not even sure how they can get away with a 7-day cooling-off period, misleading information and theft as far as I'm concerned! I will be taking this to court. I've been to university and never had to pay for a unit I haven't started."
5,2020-02-10T09:01:08.000Z,It was a roller coaster for me.Course‚Ä¶,"It was a roller coaster for me.Course content was very good but not correctly sequenced. I also found having to print, scan and upload a very difficult and expensive task since I do not work. I wish the college would offer these facilities. There also needs to be a steady team of staff. For a 6 months course I had 3 different educators, each with there own method, it was quiet confusing. More student support in terms of checking if they are going alright."
4,2020-02-09T10:38:28.000Z,Very happy for the most part :),Was very happy with all aspects of the course except that it was often quite difficult to get a hold of Assessors . On line and phone support was excellent however.Overall a good experienceCheersChris
5,2020-02-08T09:43:25.000Z,Highly recommend Open Colleges!,"I can‚Äôt recommend open colleges more! I had to extend my course and they were so great about it. The whole process from joining, course administration and the training assessors have all been fantastic throughout. Highly recommend."
1,2020-02-07T21:29:02.000Z,Not worth the time or money,I have emailed student support four times recently. No response.The course is out of date. With broken links to YouTube videos in the content. The assignments are terribly written so that they make little sense and are open to student or assessor interpretation.Overall a frustrating and not very appealing experience. Would not recommend
5,2020-02-07T07:01:20.000Z,Great for wanting online study,Open Colleges is a great choice for someone who wants to do online studying with flexible hours so you can study at your own will. Student support is great and so are the assessors. Highly recommend.
2,2020-02-06T22:59:31.000Z,Very disappointing experience,"Took too long for assessments to be marked and for support to get back to you. When I started it stated 3 days for assignments to be marked, this is now 10 days and some assessments took over a month to be marked. It says student support will respond within 48 hours, I still hadn‚Äôt heard back from them 2 months later. Would not recommend, all links are out of date or do not work. Thankfully I‚Äôve got my certificate but would not recommend them nor study with them again. Will be telling everyone I know not to study with them."
5,2020-02-06T11:13:01.000Z,Flexible and supportive,I found Open Colleges to be the perfect way for me to study around work and family. Very flexible and great with support and communication
2,2020-02-06T09:23:48.000Z,Would not recommend,"The student portal is clunky and useless - there's no easy to easily see what assignments are due, hour much you have accomplished, or what is coming next.Specifically regarding the Cert 3 of Education Support, the assignments and exams were grueling and bureaucratic rather than practical and useful. I learned how to fake my way through and answer questions to tick the boxes, but very little in the way of useful practical skills.Maybe it's just my style of learning is not suited to online study, or maybe it's just this particular course, but as for me I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,2020-02-06T08:08:18.000Z,DO NOT STUDY WITH OPEN COLLEGES!!!,"Have recently just finished studying with Open Colleges and gotten my Cert III. However, I would never study with them again, they promise to mark assessments within 10 business days which is a big fat LIE. A lot of the time you're waiting for a month which is a huge pain in the backside especially if you have to make corrections and resubmit an assessment as you will have to wait another 4 weeks to get feedback! There is little to no correspondence from assessors and trainers, they are incredibly hard to get in contact with and student support sucks, considering Open Colleges chargers more than most colleges I expected more!! PLEASE do yourself a favour and DO NOT study with Open Colleges!"
5,2020-02-06T05:05:13.000Z,It was so convenient to study from‚Ä¶,"It was so convenient to study from home. I had to juggle all apsects of my life to fit study time in but it was worth it, I really enjoyed learning and feel very happy now that I have my certificate. I can't wait to start working in my new career. I thought all the assessors/trainers were very helpful, supportive and positive. I also found student support to be very helpful. When I would email an assessor/trainer of ring student support I always knew my question would be answered. This was very reassuring. I had a study buddy,  just at the end of my course, we meet at work placement, she made finishing my course so much easier. I think Open Colleges should keep encouraging this strategy to studnets.I would highly recommend Open Colleges."
5,2020-02-05T22:41:31.000Z,Marking times could be a little bit‚Ä¶,"Marking times could be a little bit better ! A six week turn around is not good when we as students expect a shorter marking time ! Other then that, student support, teachers and assesses are just lovely !"
2,2020-02-05T09:02:01.000Z,I chose to study with Open Colleges due‚Ä¶,"I chose to study with Open Colleges due to their easy sign up, fully online content, and no time limit for course completion. As someone who has studied at multiple different universities and has a good idea about how tertiary education works, i was shocked about how poorly Open Colleges structured, marked and assesses modules.For each assessment piece, the cover page which explains the requirements of the task was horribly worded and could so easily be interpreted in a number of ways. Some sentences didn't even make sense, leaving the student to guess the best they could to formulate an assignment based upon jibberish intrsuctions which would then be bounced back (after 7-10 working days - of course) by a marker who would also not provide you with adequate instructions of feedback.It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to communicate with an assessor or someone from head office in times of need.It took weeks of me sending email after email requesting for them to organise my assessor visit to my workplace for it to happen, only to then be cancelled another number of times.Some assessor were helpful towards the end of my study when talking on the phone for my checkpoints.overall, i was incredibly disappointed with my experience with Open Colleges and would highly suggest that others look elsewhere to complete their studies"
1,2020-02-05T07:38:44.000Z,Horrific Experience - DO NOT ENROLL,"Horrific experience.A Sales Consultant from Open Colleges contacted my mother and sold her a course for me without my consent (I was 21 at the time). They then provided no support or resources and were incredibly hard to contact for help and advice. Due to receiving no support, living a very busy life and suffering from severe anxiety I could not even complete the first assignment.Nothing about equipment or programs were explained to my mother or me, we were told adobe products would be provided only to be told later that they don't do that.After hitting extreme financial hardship which included an eviction notice from our rental we were unable to continue paying open colleges.Because the course is in my name I am now facing the loss all of my belongings to a debt collection agency employed by Open Colleges. The amount owed to Open Colleges is more than the value of all our belongings combined. We are a young couple with a three year old son and this could be catastrophic for our family.We applied for hardship on the basis of illness (anxiety), and financial situation but were denied.I know now that I should have ignored the feeling of obligation to participate in the course (created by the fact that my mother had already lined up a deposit for it, and sorted out the entire enrolment prior to me even knowing about it), and instead told her I wasn't interested. We face losing everything we've worked for for over five years, our home, my sons security and our livelihoods because of this horrendously selfish company."
1,2020-02-04T13:42:21.000Z,Unprofessional and disappointing. So glad its over....,"Unfortunately my experience with Open Colleges was a big disappointment. My Trainer/Assessor was really nice but the entire company are WAY understaffed. My assessor said she looked after 1000 students alone! In addition, it would take several emails and phone calls to get anything actioned. The company I did my prac with were equally disappointed with Open Colleges and the lack of professionalism.Many of the assignments from the college featured multiple spelling errors and mistakes and when I mentioned this, it fell on deaf ears - no response. Often the online multiple answer tests did not work properly.The prac theory was 150 pages of report writing and reflection that they wanted at the same time as your 120 hours of prac which simply wasn't achievable for part-time and full-time workers so I had to spread my prac over 3 months just to do the theory!Rather than facilitating and empowering you in your actual working experience, it just seemed ridiculous and labour-some. Just disappointed, and glad its over."
1,2020-02-04T00:08:31.000Z,Horrible,Bad!! Terrible!!I have been trying to study two different courses with them since 2017. They took my money and i have no recived anything nor any helo throughout the process. My first course wss deleted when i was nearly done; they did not fix the issue. The second course more mods and assesments were added on near the end of my course and timeframe was not extended to accommodate. I asked for help iver the years and recived none. Now my course is over. Did not finish it. I request an extention time over the last 6 months and it go denied. So $5000 later and still nothing.DO NOT USE THEM
5,2020-02-03T01:39:01.000Z,Open Colleges is excellent!,Open Colleges has made online study a truly positive experience. The modules and reading provided are easy to navigate; the academic support is genuinely helpful and responds quickly; and the guidance and support from the assessors is excellent. The school I did my ES placements at even commented that they had never had such excellent communication from a study provider before.
1,2020-02-01T22:33:45.000Z,I would defiantly not recommend open colleges!,"I would defiantly not recommend open colleges to anyone. My course went through a change to keep up with government standards. Pretty much you had only 6 months to finish the course if you were already enrolled (not the full 3 years) or you would have to start again with the new material. I chose to start again as I had only completed 5 modules out of 15, and with working a full time job I would not get it complete in 6 months. I spoke to student support to see if I would have another 3 years to complete after the change over, and they said that they would extend the time for completion. However, little did they tell me that I would have to PAY MORE.No help what so ever. Not with the course work, placement or extensions. If you are thinking of studying, please, please do not go through open colleges!!"
5,2020-02-01T00:34:20.000Z,5 star training,Open Colleges gave me the opportunity to up skill in the comfort of my own home. All trainers are amazing and very helpful. They are all full of knowledge.
5,2020-01-31T21:43:41.000Z,Achieved my goal,As a mom of two kids it's great opportunity for me to go for further studies without going anywhere it would be possible only with the help of open college teams and academic and all support they provide me to complete my certificate 3 in childcare services . I highly appreciate their effort and help that they would provide to us all the time. The best thing is during my course I got job and I am going to do further studies as a diploma in childcare again with open colleges.ThanksOpen colleges team

3,2020-01-31T01:33:43.000Z,A cheaper option to TAFE but....,"Open Colleges are a cheaper alternative to TAFE but there are hidden impacts such as lengthy and laborious credit or RPL processes. Communciation was at times patchy. I found that the course work was often outdated with missing or broken links to further information. Interaction with other students was limited. My course was set up for people actually working in the industry so newcomers would have really struggled, especially in relation to the work experience hours and activities required. Student support was helpful though the there needs to be some reinvestment in the platform to compete with the likes of TAFE."
1,2020-01-30T11:11:03.000Z,Not impressed,"Most of the website links in content material did not work. Assessors are almost impossible to get in touch with, whether through Student Support or the messaging system. Instead of waiting 10 business days as predicted to receive feedback on essays, I was usually waiting about a month or more, and the last two assessments took 3 & 4 months‚Äîliterally!‚Äîto receive feedback on, and I truly believe that was only because I demanded to talk to the manager because of many reasons. One of the assessments that took the longest was actually the assessor‚Äôs wrong as I had attached all the necessary information, but she had not looked at it and marked me as if it wasn‚Äôt uploaded. I am glad to be finished with my course but won‚Äôt enrol with Open Colleges again."

Definitely Five stars from me."

3,2020-01-28T08:28:25.000Z,Cert 4 Human Resources,"I found each of my assignments were worded horribly. They seemed like there was as many long and fancy words as could be fitted in each sentence which could be easily misinterpreted. At the beginning of each module, I would commence the assignments and have to try to interpret them in whatever way I thought ‚Äòmight‚Äô be correct and hope I was right. I think they need to be reviewed to be more clear in what they are asking and possibly having more pre-written assistance explaining more of the questions in-depth (I only had this assistance in the first few modules, the rest had no guidance provided).I also found the use of having to write a script for others to record them and myself for each module made me feel like I was being judged more on my acting skills. I understand having videos is a way of seeing how a person can be in a situation, however it is not a true representation of what could really happen in a real situation, unless that situation was of us seeming awkward. Possibly only having this on some of the modules and on others possibly discuss the assignment through video chat with an assessor to show your understanding.Besides the problems of clarity and videos, I found the assessors helpful when I did have to ask for help and the amount of time given to complete everything was good."
4,2020-01-27T18:44:35.000Z,"Great way to study, but update some of the assessments for consistency","All of the essentials were there to undertake study - a good and thorough series of modules and referrences to the reading material, as well as the trainers being easy to contact with prompt responses. However, while i was able to get through the assessments, some of these assessments were quite old (2015 in some cases) and probably need a review to better relate to the website and referrence material, as well as retain consistancy amongst other assessments and modules. Other than that, its a good way to study!"

They kept promising to call back with correct info, never heard back once. I‚Äôve spent well over 30hrs on the phone just trying to get this qualification finalised. Most useless company I‚Äôve ever come across, made the entire process for a basic Cert IV incredibly stressful. Do NOT complete your qualification with this organisation."

Tutors helpful if you are insistent, otherwise they show no interest. Much can be done by the college to improve. A frustrating experience."
1,2020-01-23T14:45:25.000Z,Horrific! Verging on fraudulent thieves.,They changed the course mid-way through and then cancelled it meaning I was unable to complete it despite having close to a year left on my enrollment. They have basically stolen my course fee money and flatly rejected my claim for reimbursement.AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID.The education platform is incredibly slow and not at all user-friendly

However, some of the assessments didn't match the content, or were horribly worded/difficult to understand (not really asking what was expected). Some trainers are great and give amazing feedback to get a better understanding or answer questions with detail so you can learn, others are not so great at all. A really mixed experience with this course.Must be self-motivated - a study buddy certainly helped."

As an older person studying online for the first time it did take me a while to become accustomed to this learning method, bur once I realised that the feedback was constructive and designed to help me achieve, I really enjoyed the course. Support was also available when I needed to extend due to family/medical issues. Recommend the course and Open Colleges."

Although I originally had a concern with managing the online learning system, it was made very easy and I didn't experience any difficulties with downloading or uploading information.Although a large number of video/audio assessments were required, I understand the government expectations for this. It would have been very difficult however, without a partner I could rely on constantly.I felt that a couple of the assessments were a bit repetitive in nature eg; purchase of a printer for the organisation and then repeating this purchase in another module, the WHS requirements.Overall however, I was extremely pleased with this course and thank the wonderful trainers and assessors."
4,2020-01-20T22:12:32.000Z,Animal Care Industry course,Very detailed course material which gave me a thorough understanding of the things I need to know to work in the animal care industry.

How ever you put of lot money into your study so you would think they could at-least send your course material out to you with a tracking number instead of just with standard post! Now I have to go through the hassle of filling out a Statatory declaration form and having to wait for that to be processed then get the material sent out yet again in standard post. Track and trace just makes life so much easier for everyone!!!
1,2020-01-10T04:15:07.000Z,"They're brave, if nothing else...","They're brave, if nothing else. I mean, they asked me - an actual human who endured a 2-year commitment to them - to provide public feedback, so, yeah, I guess I'll give them that. Oh, and $6,000.I managed to complete a Diploma of Graphic Design... not through Open Colleges by through my own desperate determination, the support of my peers and the miracle that is Google. So... where do I even start?Let's start with the course itself. An overview of the modules makes it look satisfactory, but once you begin to really engage with the content, you'll realise how truly lamentable it is: irrelevant, superficial and outdated information; repetitive filler pages on WHS and ""critical thinking"" (irony, anyone?); broken links; inane and unrealistic learning activities; untrustworthy and unscrutinised sources; and, perhaps most disappointing, a dire famine of actual, solid, technical instruction. The only content of any quality were about 60% of the instructional videos and articles they lifted directly from Adobe and Lynda. When this all became apparent to me, I'll admit, I was pretty miffed that I paid $6k just to be linked to the resources included in my $500 Adobe student subscription. But, naive as I was, I told myself, ""Yeah, ok, but at least you have trainers and assessors - actual experienced professionals - to teach you."" Oh, dear heart, no...Of the 34 assessments I submitted, I received helpful, practical and relevant technical advice on one. And it wasn't like, ""here are some really good instructions that will help you improve this"" - Lord no! It was, ""by the way, you know you can do this, right?"". No explanation how; just a cryptic hint - and for that crumb, I was grateful.With the exception of perhaps two or three extremely responsive and supportive staff members (who sadly seemed to only have a minimal student load), the trainers and assessors were about as helpful as my Spanglish-speaking, non-technological abuela would be. Actually, no, that's not fair; my abuela at least wants to help, even when she doesn't know how. These trainers and assessors often ignored messages until they were put on blast on the public discussion board, or were dobbed in to Student Support. They would offer the weak excuse that there were technical difficulties preventing them from seeing the notifications of new messages, but ignored questions about whether this would be fixed (not to mention that, if they were aware of this issue, you would think they would take responsibility enough to take the extra 30 seconds each day to manually check for new messages).On the rare occasion such a trainer/assessor did answer, they'd make formidable political opponents, so strong was there ability to dodge hard questions, not listen to the problem and find non-answers. Combining that with days, weeks or even months of delays between responses, and you can see why it was only sensible to just give up and get on with it the best you could.Then there were the actual assessments and the feedback following them. The assessments were arduous, repetitive, and irrelevant - yes, welcome to online education. Before this, I completed my Bachelor degree online, so I'm under no delusions about the bleak reality of online study and annoying assessments; however, the woes did not end here.The resources provided for these assessments (e.g. logos, mockups, etc.) were often (excuse the jargon) potato quality or just inaccessible, rendering our designs unacceptable for our portfolios because of their inevitable amateur appearance. Further, despite constant and very strong feedback from students, the instructions in the tasks were so unclear and inconsistent that at times they were incomprehensible. So not only were we made to complete inane tasks that would never fill the promise of, ""well at least you have something for your portfolio at the end,"" but we would be reduced to many teary, rage-fueled meltdowns in the process.Did the pain end there? Pressing that submit button and breathing a sigh of relief that at least it was another torturous assessment task complete? Absolutely not! The feedback that would eventually follow (often on the cusp of, or exceeding, the already-extended 10-business-day waiting period), was reliable, sure... in that it always started with the same comment that we had named the assessment files correctly. It seemed to me an odd thing to comment on... until I realised that naming things correctly must actually be a rare skill at Open Colleges, given how often they put the wrong student name on feedback.Beyond this reliable praise, however, feedback was usually vague and unhelpfully finicky, and came with a 50% chance of being a Withheld grade, requiring resubmission. Sometimes it was because the student hadn't read the instructions correctly (fair); sometimes it was because the assessor hadn't read them correctly; often it was because both had tried to read them, but neither had truly understood, so the student, having tried to follow advice from previous students and dust-covered discussion threads, took one understanding while the assessor took a different one. Given that we had to pay for monthly extensions after the first two years and that the course was being taught out (I'll get to that), these delays were beyond infuriating. And the comments provided by these assessors were often as I said, unhelpfully finicky and not constructive, feeling more like feedback for the sake of feedback than actual, thoughtful commentary. Rather than articulating and explaining areas for improvement, so it looked suspiciously like a subjective opinion rather than professional feedback. In the early days, I was pretty vocal about these issues and even asked to be given clear marking criteria or rubrics to guide our work off; but the feedback fell on deaf ears.And then we have the technology: the stage upon which this tragedy was set. Open Colleges uses OpenSpace. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. (See, I can be objective!) It suffers from the usual bugs that are mildly annoying but workable. The problem, however, is that it's a virtual ghost town. Staff, as mentioned earlier, rarely interact on it, so neither do the students. Open Colleges seems to be under the delusion that students will buddy up and connect through it, so they based every assessment on the necessity of connecting with and getting feedback from other students. Thankfully, the students banded together through their common hardship and supported each other on a more usable, external platform without support from Open Colleges; but before finding this shangri-la of beautiful, helpful, supportive people, most of us had to first spend months of despair wandering alone amongst the abandoned discussions, feebly calling our own echoes for help.And finally, the teach-out. It is with great relief that I understand Open Colleges no longer offers the Diploma of Graphic Design. Flawed to the very end, they even failed to clearly communicate to us that the course was on teach-out (however, try calling them and you'll likely spend hours on the phone to hold music before being disconnected because someone apparently gave you the number to a phone line that doesn't exist.) The student populous first became suspicious a year or so ago when someone noticed that the course was no longer on their website, but Open Colleges said nothing of this to us. They assured us we could apply for up to 6 months of paid extensions to complete the course if needed; but then, as we applied, our applications began getting declined, shortened to only 3 months. For most of us, we work, we have families, we have other commitments to juggle, and we had our plans to finish turned upside down by this sudden lack of commitment to the additional 6 months. When we raised the alarm, we were told we would all receive an email explaining the teach out and extensions. We didn't. All we've had to date are private case-by-case responses and one sneaky reply to a panicked student message in the discussion board asking what teach-out means. Unable to even trust that these long-promised extensions will be available to us when we need them, many of us have decided it is safer to scramble out of the quicksand as fast as we possibly can, trying to pull each other out as we go.I entered this course enthusiastic to build my theoretical and technical expertise in Graphic Design and come out feeling like a professional. Then my expectations were brought down to just attaining the piece of paper that says, ""I can do some stuff"", and I could teach myself the rest. Today, as a new graduate, I am embarrassed to admit where I got my Diploma from, and for as long as I possibly can, plan on only describing my formal education as ""trained in Graphic Design"" and hope my work will speak enough for itself.I can't speak for any other courses but if they ever do reopen their Diploma of Graphic Design, I cannot emphasise enough how fast and far you should run."
1,2020-01-10T03:13:39.000Z,Avoid the Graphic Design Course,"Poor resources, out of date links and no actual teaching made my experience with Open Colleges one to forget. Feedback was virtually no existent and marking of assignments now can take up to half a month. The main tutor MD seemed more interested in how files were named rather than their actual content and his feedback was beyond useless."

1,2020-01-16T01:44:25.000Z,"An honest opinion, do not give them a cent.","Regarding the CERT IV in Accounting and Diploma of Accounting.Unfortunately, one star is the lowest you can score.This isn't going to be some angry, ranting, over-the-top dramatic review about my experience, I will simply state the facts.1. I found hundreds of errors. Hundreds. That isn't an exaggeration. Errors in spelling, math, concepts, etc. You name it, OpenColleges found a way to make a mistake.2. The staff and student support honestly didn't seem to care about the errors. I took screenshot after screenshot and sent them in with my official complaint, only to be told in the end, ""We acknowledge that there are mistakes.""3. I am taking additional tax courses by H&R Block (which I do recommend) because the tax units were so riddled with errors that it was almost impossible to get through them.4. I was so frustrated, anxious, and depressed, more often than not due to the errors I would find. It made studying very difficult.I could go on and on, but if I prevent at least one person from wasting their time with this nonsense then I will feel more accomplished than I do after completing a Cert IV and Diploma with OpenColleges. The Certificate and Diploma don't feel worth the paper they were printed on.Don't let flashy discounts pull you in. Spend more on TAFE.Just don't study with OpenColleges, just do not do it.Looking forward to the ""Sorry you feel that way"" response this review will receive from OpenColleges.Edit: Notice the response from OC below. They only addressed the spelling errors. The spelling errors, while a problem, are not the main problem. The errors with the content are the problem! The mathematical errors are the problem. They will dance around the issue and refuse to acknowledge it."
1,2020-01-09T02:36:35.000Z,Save your money and go through TAFE,"I would honestly never study through Open Colleges again (Especially not a health related course) You are given all coursework and basically made to figure it out on your own with only one assessor you can depend on, but even so she is only one person and can take a while to get back to you. Very difficult when you are juggling family/life commitments and set out time to study, but when you need help no one is there. There is no functioning ""group dynamic"" so you cant connect with peers. The forums are totally useless.  ALSO When you do hand in assignments that are well done and in a TAFE environment would more than equal a pass. You are deemed 'unsatisfactory' and have to constantly re-submit.To anyone considering doing health service assistant / aged care courses. DEFINITELY Go through TAFE. Much better support, you can talk to them directly and they have a more intimate role in your work placement (from what I discovered )"

3,2020-01-07T00:44:00.000Z,Functional but needs a lot of work.,"- Loved how easy the site was to use to download and upload assessment. Easy to navigate. Loved that I could study at any time in my busy schedule and upload assessments at my own pace.- The assessment questions sometimes made absolutely no sense. It seemed like the person who wrote the assessment was trying to us as many ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô words they could to ask the question which left me and others very confused on what the actual question was. Some questions were repeated later in the assessment but worded differently.- The online student support was never available when I needed it which left me needing to email my assessors or message which 5/10 I never got a response. However, Nicole Manning was fantastic! I always got a quick response from her and answers I needed.- Some assessments did not clearly specify what was required which left me needing to go back and do twice. For example, the work placement video assessment I for did not explicitly state that I was expected to list the steps I was taking in my video."
1,2020-01-06T23:58:10.000Z,This school is a joke - do not study through Open Colleges,"Student services, general organisation and communication amongst staff are awful. I ended up doing over 240 hours of unpaid work placement due to being stuffed around, messages and issues not being passed on by the people I spoke to and appointments and assessments not being made of followed up on. Even when appointments for assessments were finally booked, the assessors neglected to call, leaving me to follow up and prompt the calls myself. None of my messages through the student services message centre were ever addressed. I have finished my course and graduated now and if I call through to student support the automated voice STILL says I have queries that are being processed. That's how rediculous the student support is. Noone communicates within the school which lead to two different assessors messaging me at once, both wanting to book my face to face appointment. Every time I called about an issue I had to re-explain everything going on as messages or notes on my issues were clearly never recorded or passed on as each person I spoke to, including the assessors and trainers, had no idea I was even experiencing issues.""Staffing issues"" are not a good enough excuse for the things that happened. I am not happy or satisfied with my experience. I paid for this course, which I could have had for far less up front cost through Tafe, because I was assured this school, it's services and materials were superior. This is a lie. I am currently studying through Tafe and wouldn't hesitate to say they out perform Open Colleges in every way.I will be lodging a formal complaint with the quality assurance board for training providers as I do not believe I was given the experience advertised and I do not believe this training provider actually provided me with any training.Save your money, go through Tafe."

3,2019-12-18T00:21:28.000Z,Veterinary Nursing review,"I would only recommend vet nursing through open colleges if you already have employment in a veterinary clinic and have enough motivation to study online without the help of face to face communication. Although it was easy to get in touch with student support, there would always be a delay in hearing back from the course assessors, this can be quite frustrating if you need help on a particular assessment or question in port folio. The communication and course requirements always differed between different staff members in student support which became quite frustrating, other then that the course is very detailed in what you are required to do!"
1,2019-12-17T07:14:46.000Z,Open Colleges Course,"I would NEVER recommend anyone to use Open Colleges.They are slow to respond to requests, student support does not really help anyone, referring you always to a trainer of which you have to book a team in the future, usually 1-2 weeks.Initially they stated they had support for people with learning disabilities, but I received nil support, even after completing a special test, which confirmed I needed extra support.The portal is incredibly slow. Whilst waiting for marking you have to call and get the next module opened. All modules should be open so you can work at your own pace.These seem like blatant attempts to make the course run longer, hence you must pay more for extensions, increasing the cost many times.Don't use Open Colleges.

As were there links that didn‚Äôt work in the assessment helpers. This just showed the lack of time taken to ensure that assessments stayed current. As I got further into my course I realised how unreliable the assessor were. One would say one thing was wrong but the other would say something else was wrong and what the first said was wrong was actually fine. There was no consistency. I also found that the questions never explained in enough detail what the assessor wanted to see. There was many occasions were the assessments were sent back saying ‚Äòyou haven‚Äôt included .......‚Äô when the question never asked for anything of the sort. Consistency was definitely not something that was shown. There were many assessor who couldn‚Äôt have cared to help and that was frustrating and very disappointing. It says marking of assessments takes no more then 10 working day. Many times it took weeks and sometimes months. There is definitely a lot to be worked on.It took 2 months after finishing my work placement to get my workplace assessor to come out even though I had been trying to organise it for months beforehand. Once they finally came out I had to chase her for her report so that I was able to complete my course. Once everything was said and done, I had to call them to find out where my certificate once."

1,2019-12-10T13:06:55.000Z,PLEASE avoid this company,"I am very disappointed in open colleges and honestly wouldn't recommend taking the Cert III in education support course through them.I quickly learnt that better learning material is available (for free) online than what was provided in the course modules and my grades reflected this as I received high distinction grades every time I looked elsewhere for information. Some of the assessments were interesting and helpful, however I frequently found myself completing tasks that were completely irrelevant to the job role of a teachers assistant let alone a teacher, which is a huge waste of time.Oh, and don‚Äôt bother trying to think outside the box when answering questions, OC are clearly working off a checklist so only want a genetic response.Turn around time for assessments being graded took around a month when it was only supposed to be 10 days.Support is available for students via live chat but they NEVER appear to be online!

There are of course both positives and negatives, although you can tend to feel very isolated, the nature of the course is very flexible. You can choose entirely when to submit your work as long as you complete it within the time frame. The team recognises that support and communication with students is extremely important. I do think it would be a big help to provide some more structure/guidance to students to improve time management and to give an understanding of whether they're on the right track. Otherwise I am happy with my experience  and grateful to the team for their kindness and patience especially when providing me with more time to complete my studies. Thank you open colleges"
1,2019-12-05T05:55:21.000Z,They only want your money,"They only want your moneyI needed to do a course for my business. The learning material was very basic and didn't cover much of what would be needed in the role.The real stickler was that they don't clearly show that when you use their supervised exams, you are still required to complete a Supervisor Declaration. Realising my error, I submitted my Supervisor Declaration (simply a screenshot of ProctorU confirmations) with 5 days until my course timeline was due to finish. They classify this as an assignment and didn't mark within 5 days (they can take up to 10 days) so I have had to pay an extra $50 simply for them to double-check that I did indeed use ProctorU."
4,2019-12-05T00:41:15.000Z,Not bad,Not bad. Studying online is difficult if you‚Äôre not motivated. But easy if you are and work full time as I did. Not having someone face to face to show you things was challenging in its own way but if you‚Äôre already working in the field it makes sense to choose them.
3,2019-12-04T11:26:18.000Z,Cert IV in Accounting and Bookkeeping Course,"Overall I received what I needed from the Cert IV in Accounting and Bookkeeping course.The change in Jan 2019 from MYOB to Reckon was frustrating however, the course material improved with this change - more structured and professional, less spelling and grammar errors, and more relevant to the outside world.More information around the modules being able to be unlocked all at once would have been useful at the start of the course, rather than the back end via page links I found after Module 9.From the posted comments, the awareness around short staffing, long wait times for marked assessments, and the difficulty in arranging a suitably timed student support call have done the rounds with good reason.The reality is, if you want to study online with no face to face, it is quite difficult to do with little or no prior experience in the accounting/bookkeeping space. Open Colleges has had a good crack at it but some improvement is still needed."
3,2019-12-04T06:31:45.000Z,Has potential,"The layout of the modules is great.The trainers were always willing to help and mostly returned questions and assessment feedback quickly.Student support were always cheerful and happy to help out.Unfortunately, I thought that each assessment was written poorly, with instructions being unclear and confusing.They often read disjointed and with inconsistent terminology. It seemed like it was written by a few different writers and was not proof read to ensure it all came together smoothly.I saw that other students often shared my frustration and confusion regarding assessment instructions as they posted their questions and feedback in the online portal.All in all, I enjoyed my experience with open colleges however the content needs urgent attention. If that was fixed during my course, I would‚Äôve given 5 stars."
5,2019-12-04T06:26:57.000Z,Finished 2 courses with Open Colleges,"I have just completed my second course with Open Colleges (Cert IV in Bookkeeping in 2014 & Diploma & Advanced Diploma of Accounting (Tax) now 2019). Being an online course it took a bit of discipline to keep on track time wise, but my experience with Open Colleges has been a great one with excellent support from trainers and admin staff. Thank for an enjoyable learning experience."

The only issue I had throughout was some misinformation which effectively caused an issue with work placement however this was quickly resolved by Open Colleges.  Thank you so much for helping me achieve my CERT III in Individual Support.
4,2019-12-04T03:13:42.000Z,Good course content,All good to deal with. At the start I did find it harder to get a response from some lecturers but later on this improved dramatically. The course content itself was really good but I am surprised they use ‚Äòreckon‚Äô software as I have found it to not be as popular as Xero or even MYOB.
5,2019-12-03T08:05:08.000Z,appreciation.,"I am so glad I chose to complete my Diploma Of Nursing with Open Colleges. I knew right alway from the moment I stepped on campus that this is where I would begin my nursing journey. The campus is clean, and all the staff and students are friendly, there was a supportive community atmosphere. The simulation labs are so well made with plenty of equipment to practice your skills.  I had the most amazing nursing lecturer, she didn‚Äôt just teach me theory but she made me work ready. She was always willing to allow me to book the lab for one on one assistance and provided me with feedback.All the good feedback I received while on placement was a reflection of her teaching. Nurses I have worked with while on placement were impressed by the level of knowledge, particularly with medications and  clinical skills. Thank you Open Colleges for having me as one of your students, I absolutely recommend anyone who is passionate about nursing to apply with open colleges."

The support and feedback throughout the course was really good, and actually improved along the way with the introduction of ‚ÄúChat Support‚Äù and audio feedback for assessments.The only downside was I never received the Combination meter which was supposed to be part of the course materials."

1,2019-12-02T22:12:57.000Z,Dissatisfied Student,"Lacks student support and miscommunication between staff makes it difficult to know what is expected. Inconsistent between assessors and their expectations of assignments. I have done a number of online certificates and even online at university, I understand the commitment and determination it takes to study online, open colleges is by far the worst experience i have had studying online. The requirements of work placement were not discussed in any detail and finding an appropriate workplace during my course was extremely difficult.Finding placement is completely up to the student and open colleges does not help. The requirements of work placement defeated the purpose of online study, if i had known the expectations in regards to this i would have looked into alternative options to study Beauty Therapy where i would gain more practical experience, with support."

I received help when I needed and the materials were available.One thing need to be explained somewhere is that assessments need to be answered in the format is given as some people (happened to me too) do not know and answer in blank format.
1,2019-11-29T21:00:04.000Z,Honestly I wouldn't recommend Open‚Ä¶,"Honestly I wouldn't recommend Open Colleges as they make it very difficult to graduate. Whenever you submit an assignment whether you have passed or not the assessors grade it as withheld. The assessors need to assess the assignment for what it is and give the student an option to better their grade, not force them to. By withholding grades, this discourages the students and makes the process slower to graduate. I view this as a money grabbing exercise because the student has to extend their course because of the time it takes the assessors to mark their assignments. It takes 15 working days for your grades to come back each time the assessors withhold a grade meaning that over time you will eventually need to extend your course and pay more money."

On more than one occasion my assessor needed several reminders to complete work i was waiting on. I also think the delay between completing assesments and marking needs to improve. It took up to 3 weeks on average. However whenever I rang and inquired, staff were more than happy to help and had the matter sorted. Overall i was very happy with the service provided."

However, many assignments were confusingly written and didn't seem to have been created by a subject matter expert. The course also doesn't make it clear on expectations regarding referencing requirements, and the need to do your own research, i.e. not all the assignment answers will be found in the course content."

In fact I am considering seeking legal advise on how to get my money back!In answer to the reply I had:  that is what I tried hence this review, in 2 months I haven't had a response to any of my questions."

Other than that it was very enjoyable."

The formatting of the assessment questions is very poor and lengthy. It felt that the assessment questions are focusing more in quantities and less in quality. Student services are great but sometime feels they don‚Äôt have access to correct information on the progress an individual I.e what is completed and to be completed. Suggest a self service option for student to view themselves.

Nothing is urgent to them.Very clear Open Colleges has not even looked at my case.My overdue payment is with Debit Success who keep attempting to extract an overdue payment from my bank account after I told them I have contacted Open Colleges many times to try and sort out.You would think this would prompt them to get in touch with Open Colleges or me to resolve the issue...nope!Debit Success ignored this and continues to deduct money from an account I told them has insufficient funds.Ontop of this I am incurring dishonour fees and they are still continuing/attempting to deduct $$ that isn't there, STILL without attempting to contact me - just going ahead, doing their own thing.Neither Debit Success or Open Colleges has bothered to get in touch with each other to understand the situation, let alone myself. Neither have bothered getting back to me dispite the numerous attempts of me trying to speak to someone!With this lack of support and communication I DEFINITELY will not be recommending this lot to anyone. What a crappy way to treat people paying big money for such a cheap standard experience where no one is present.Imagine if they were proud about working for Open Colleges. Nothing to be proud of. It's like a farmyard over there."

1,2019-11-15T03:02:26.000Z,Worst online course experience ever,"Worst online course experience ever. Dont waste your money or time. They make all the promises in the world and break every one of them. Claims of the premium price reflecting the turn around time for assessments being graded in 5-10 days and exceptional 7 days a week support blah blah is utter rubbish. Once they have you signed up they couldn't care less. Ignore all the good reviews because they are all lies.Student assessment module graded times exceeded 3 weeks and the proceeding moduel isnt unlocked until the previous one has been assessed, i was told that even if the previous moduel had not been assessed that as long as it was completed the preceeding moduel would be available when this was a lie.When your dealing with the person whos trying to sign you up/ enroll you the response times are misleading as once you are signed up your emails are all but ignored and responses become non existent.There seems to also be a Russian theme going on at this joint as the person who enrolled me and was pushy for me to sign up via sending me emails on a daily basis and unsolicited calls to my mobile was Russian then I sign up and the online course instructor is also Russian..odd for an Australia based online courses company that uses being an Australian based company as a selling point and falsely implying you will get an Australian based level of standards and not some offshore course from a Philippine call center. From my experience the two are the same,  however with this company your paying double.Honestly stay as far away from them as you can. They charge almost double the price as other company's offering the same courses and claim its because they offer a premium service but all the negative comments I read on their competitors,  this company is doing the exact same thing, only diffrence is they charge you double for the privilege of dealing with their incompetency and utter dissreagard and unproffessionalism.There is a reason its hard to locate reviews other than on Trustpilot for this company and it's not because they are a 5 star company thats for certian, if they were then it wouldn't be hard to locate multiple sources/sites showing these reviews."

I was told over the phone I would get some money back but contact special consideration to see if you can get more, when I contacted them I was told I'd be getting nothing back and there's no recollection of the phone call with someone telling me I would get money back. poor service all round."

I had some experience programming already so did not learn a whole lot more about how to write a program however i did pick up alot of other useful knowledge along the way, specifically; databases, testing, documentation, mobile apps, xml. It was great to receive feedback from the trainers for every assignment and the encouragement i received kept me interested, especially towards the end when i was time poor with work commitments.If I were to point out negatives, i would say that i spent 2/3 of my time on documentation for the assignments, a more even spread of hands on programming/documentation would have been more benificial to me.Well worth the commitment."

The customer support team are slow, taking a week to reply to one email. Whats the point in being an online college if you cant function promptly online?? I am now currently waiting up to 12 business days for assignments to be marked, even redo submissions.

5,2019-11-11T00:06:14.000Z,AMAZING PLACE TO STUDY.,such an amazing place to study. the teachers are super supportive and always willing to help you when you do not understand. the time spent on campus is used wisely by the teachers to help learn those clinical and critical thinking skills you often don't learn in other forms of learning. such an amazing experience with small classes who all work together to help everyone make it through to the end. highly recommend.

They don‚Äôt give you full information when signing up, they have no compassion when you hit hardship and then when you try to reinstate because you decided if you are going to have to give them money anyway you might as well continue, they make it even harder making it easier for you to throw in the towel and still pay them money for nothing!!"

After paying 5k + for a course i have been completing over the last few years, they have deleted all of my work due to a recent upgrade and expect me to complete all over again. My response so far is that they sent me an email in July. That email did not explain that topics i had completed would be wiped because one of my recordings was not opening on their end. Coming up to 3 weeks now without a response from their complaints team that of course has not contact number.  Quick to take your money for extensions but terrible when you need helpRead these articles. They were a few years ago but nothing has changed. They have recently updated the course material which is 1000 times better but expect me to re-do everything in one month or pay more in extension feesRead the article on consumeraction.org -Training Provider Open Colleges sued for breach of consumer lawor the forums on whirlpool"

I provided all the info requested like letters from doctors etc.. and they're still refusing me a full refund even though online in their special consideration t&c's it states that a full refund is an option. Emails go unanswered to & the emails I have received from them are cold, unprofessional, full of typos and lack any empathy. I will be seeking proffesional advice on getting my money back."
1,2019-11-07T22:07:26.000Z,Full of broken promises just so they get paid..,"I was promised I would learn how to create ads and understand ads on all the social channels. This was the ONLY reason I did the course. Not once did it go into setting up ads of any kind. I was EXTREMELY angry about it as I feel like I wasted months learning stuff I already knew. The course was also awful with references backdated from 5+ years ago. The online world evolves rapidly, references from 5 years ago are obsolete. The assessments were not detailed enough, I never felt confident in doing them as I was lacking resources and when I would ask a question in regards to where to find the info I was told to just make something up. I would not recommend this course to anyone."

I am passionate about studying and learning so that I can advance in my chosen career path, and I was able to achieve this with the opportunity given by Open Colleges.  I found the experience very challenging at times, which made the journey and the end result even more rewarding!"
1,2019-11-06T01:56:43.000Z,"Bad, bad college money hungry.","If I could, I would give this money hungry company a 0. All there interested in is taking your money, if you call and tell them that you have a financial situation if they could at least lower the repayments or give you a cheaper payout figure that would be helpful, but no they just run straight to the debt collecting agency as soon as you miss a payment, they are a bunch of money hungry people, and the courses are ridiculous, I didn't even start it, didn't finished it and I didn't do anything in between,  it's a rubbish company, no help what so ever."
2,2019-11-05T01:57:14.000Z,Open Colleges is a shocker.,"I couldn't honestly recommend a course by this company as their priority is taking your money, not providing you with a quality educational outcome. I completed a Diploma of Social Media Marketing through sheer determination as it was a complete dog's breakfast. Training materials that we so disgustingly lacking in information, young trainers who are so out of their depth that they instructed students to google (don't believe me - check out their webinars on Youtube), and assessments on topics for which there is not one word in the training materials. Trainers say they want to help, but then do a complete about-face and turn into little corporate hags toeing the company line of 'I cannot assist you' as soon as they fear you might actually have a case for legitimately getting their money back, given its failure to offer a fit for purpose course under Consumer Law. Students complained en mass but these complaints were largely ignored, and a group complaint to ASQA resulted in the College being instructed to update the course - not that this ever happened. I implore you to go to TAFE or uni to get your qualifications as Open Colleges is a truly abdominal excuse for a training provider and you really won't be taught anything useful, as you will be googling it all, at their direction."
4,2019-11-05T01:28:51.000Z,The Interior Design and Decoration Diploma,"The Interior Design and Decoration Diploma compared to others is much more complete. Assessors are kind and in the best disposition to help. It was a great learning on-line experience.I feel the program is more for local students than for foreign students due to all the Australian Standards, Codes, etc. we need to read, understand and apply in the assessments. This is not helpful for foreign students like me. Each country is different so we must do this kind of research regarding each student countrie¬¥s Standards, Codes, Policies, etc.Module 14, using CAD, must be updated! Too difficult to understand, it is incomplete, explanations of how to use important commands are missing and it is quite complicated to learn the way it is shown here. It must definitely be a pre-requisite.Regarding Sketchup and Vray, the versions for students are too old. They need to be updated too. It is almost impossible to learn Vray this way.As a student I think I invested too much time studying Australian Standards, Codes of Practice, etc. It would have been better to invest that time in learning more about Lighting, Decoration and Materials.I think that there must be a space to share our works. There are students from all over the world, so I find interesting to see what other designers (students) are doing in Australia, Africa, Middle East, and all over the world."

1,2019-11-01T03:27:18.000Z,Self Serving and Poor Content,"Firstly. The content was atrocious. We were doing content in assignments we hadn't even learnt about, which was either in the following module (only opened if you complete the prior module) or not in the modules at all.Course content is made up prior and the OC bid on the cheepest one. And you feel that cheep quality as you go through.I was part of a course that was being superseded by the government. Many of us had anywhere from 5 to 17 months cut from the course. No extensions and a one year, one email warning. People had to pay differing amounts (Australian students) from 8000k to 11000k. Complaints were handled with the same mixed and cofused messaging as we had complained about in the first place.They will do everything in their power to not give you a refund, change your course or check in the see if your being motivated to finish.I would look elsewhere to be honest."

1,2019-10-29T23:47:06.000Z,A Terrible Experience,"Having worked at a pet store for 2 years, I knew a lot of the theory in my Cert 2. I chose Open Colleges because I could easily complete it and get the qualification for the things I already knew. Oh how wrong I was. A process which should have taken me a few months, and maybe some extended time when trying to organise my own placement, was stretched over more than a year because of how poorly the open space is organised, the lack of communication and very little help from Open Colleges.A change to the course in the first 3 months meant I had to do more assignments for modules I had already completed. This made me feel like all the work I had already done was worth nothing as the new assignments were very similar to what I had already done. Over a year later when I was waiting for my graduation email from my assessor I get told I have 6 uncompleted assignments, despite the fact I had asked an assessor, before the transition, if I had completed my GAP assessments correctly and they said yes. When I looked over everything again I am 100% positive I did complete everything as I was instructed to but my assignments were still deleted. My assessor was sympathetic to my situation and allowed me to extend my course free of charge (my course was going to expire in 3 days when I realised I had 6 more assignments to do). My assessor helped as she could and was honestly the only saving grace of this whole experience.The open space is terribly organised, the information is all over the place and if I have read something somewhere I can't seem to find it again. On the communication board students are encouraged to ask questions and yet the only response they get is ""call student support"". When I was working out my GAP assignments (the first time) I was told I needed to book a skype call as this was the best way for me to be helped. I booked my call for a Saturday morning and sat at my laptop waiting for a call which never came. I wasn't surprised as this proved to be very typical of Open Colleges.I have studied a Bachelors through Open Universities so I thought this experience would be similar but maybe because my Bachelors was through an actual university they are at a much higher standard. Studying online with them has never been an issue.Open Colleges has made me want to rip my hair out so many times. If I hear anyone say they are thinking of getting a qualification similar to mine or studying online I tell them no matter what, never go through Open Colleges."

5,2019-10-29T10:17:56.000Z,I highly recommend Open Colleges to anyone considering online study,"I highly recommend Open Colleges to anyone considering studying online. I have recommended them to friends, two who have already signed up and one more who is just about to join. I found the website very easy to use, but the best point was the excellent support provided by trainers, assessors and student support. Every time I needed to communicate with any staff from open space I was greeted with very friendly, prompt and professional service, by phone and email. I am very grateful to everyone at Open Colleges and would definitely chose them again. I cannot praise them enough!"
5,2019-10-29T06:26:02.000Z,The whole experience was so worth it,The whole experience was so worth it. To look back on what I achieved is incredible. I had some very basic knowledge in programming but learning new languages and procedures was amazing. Well worth doing this course.
1,2019-10-29T02:09:41.000Z,"Limited flexibility and support, it was more stressful than it needed to be",I chose to study online as I was working full time. I thought considering that not being face to face is hard enough that there would be more support available online. I often waited days for a reply and despite emails directing me to certain support lines I would constantly get transferred to different teams. It took a while to get in contact with the right person before being able to talk about my issue. The initial phone numbers or contact given were never correct. The course changed mid way through and I was forced to complete additional work. This was made completely impossible and many of the assignments were duplicates but still had to be completed which added more unnecessary study time. I also missed out on days of placement as my form did not get back to me in time despite giving in to the team with over 2 weeks notice. It came back to me as my student ID was wrong but only a few days before my placement was scheduled to start and then no one could help me fast track it. This was despite telling the team my sense of urgency as this placement had to be booked about a year in advance. I also used a different student ID for all past forms which were accepted but all of a sudden I had a new one which was never passed on to me. The course was much more stressful than it needed to be purely for the lack of support and flexibility. Studying online should have more flexibility or better support and process' as students are studying online for a reason.

4,2019-10-25T16:18:47.000Z,Room for improvement,"Open Colleges was good to deal with before and well after the whole transition debacle. However, during the transition period, and after it, the mess and debacle was extremely stressful. Open colleges did not do everything they said they would and i had to chase up my trainer to remind them to contact my supervisor for the questions. I didnt automatically rollover to graduated status either which was frustrating and disappointing even after calling and the lady said she would roll me over manually. She didnt do it. i called a week later to check and it hadnt been done."

4,2019-10-24T21:19:25.000Z,Prac hours slightly excessive,I really enjoyed the theory side of things and my Prac was an amazing experience. The only thing is that I think that 120 Prac hours is excessive as the other colleges only require 100 hours. The reason I think this is because the course is only a Cert III compared to other colleges that are a Cert IV. Other than that I had an amazing experience and I‚Äôm glad everything is complete

Open colleges has gotten me the qualification i wanted while working full time and granting 2 extensions. It has been a great experience. With my particular course i wish it covered more. I have a job as a veterinary nurse and feel a lot of areas have not been covered in my course. Student support always take days to reply to my emails, and there were no final exams which didn't make me feel challenged or like i was learning adequately as in a school like setting where end of unit exams allowed you to re-cap everything you learnt, this was not the case. Neither was an end of year/end of certificate exam to allow the re-cap of everything you have studied so far. This made me feel like without the constant need to refer back (to study for constant tests or exams) i forgot most of what i had learnt. The assessors are very lovely and helped everywhere they could."
4,2019-10-23T05:38:07.000Z,Cert 2 in electrotechnology,"Overall the course was fine. The content was mostly good if a little unorganized. Often the web links were broken. Feedback and assignments were marked fairly quickly. It's a shame the course is being discontinued. Also had issue with the college not notifying about the course being in teach out mode - which means you cannot extend the course finishing time. I would recommend open colleges only if you are well organised and able to teach yourself well, it very much relies on you teaching yourself. It was good to be able to do this course fully online, some improvements like dedicated videos from an actual Australian TAFE would have been nice (often used USA based recordings).

The course is however, a little outdated - some videos are from 5 years ago and therefore, the tutorials on software were no longer relevant and as such, I had to seek tutorials externally so to learn new software.

4,2019-10-15T08:37:16.000Z,I highly recommend Open Colleges,"My rating is really 4.5 stars. I recently completed a Cert III in Education Support through Open Colleges.  I really enjoyed the course and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Open Colleges to anyone looking to study. I could go on about the things I love about it, so I will dot point some of my highlights!- The website and course content are easy to navigate- The learning structure is well set out, with menus and easy to understand theory.  I particularly love how they include links to videos and other texts to help support you in your learning.-The multiple choice quiz at the end of every module is a great way to test your learning before you start the assessments.- There are no due dates for assignments which makes juggling study and work/family commitments easy.-The trainers are helpful and from my experience are very quick in their responses.-There is a wonderful and supportive community of students studying the same course who you can rely upon for assistance and tips when needed too.The only reason Open Colleges are losing the half point is for the length of time it takes for assessments to be graded.  We are told that they are marked within 10 business days,which used to be the case,  but lately it has taken much longer than this and can be up to a 4-6 weeks later.Other than that, it has been a fantastic way to study and I would highly recommend Open Colleges to anyone wanting to pursue their dreams."

3,2019-10-14T23:40:20.000Z,I would have liked more interaction‚Ä¶,"I would have liked more interaction with the teachers and a message from time to time checking on how I'm going with the course.I would have liked an email when I finished the course to confirm I had finished it all and saying congratulations.I found most of the modules really informative but some were just a few sentences- more information would have been better.Over all though, I was happy with the course and it was easy to progress through the modules."
2,2020-03-09T22:53:23.000Z,So terribly disappointing.,"Unfortunately I don't have positive words for Open Colleges and the  Diploma of Social Media Marketing. I‚Äôm too embarrassed to put my ‚Äòqualification‚Äô on my cv!!For me, the course failed in so many ways to live up to its advertising.It was clunky, poorly written, and had many, many gaps. Core skills in social media marketing were not taught - simple things that people doing a course at this level expect - like how to set up Facebook pages, websites, blogs. Training materials contained missing information, spelling mistakes, poor grammar and information that is just plain wrong. The trainers instructed their students to go and google to fill the gaps. Students were also assessed on things for which there is not one word in the training materials.There was also no one proactively engaging with students -  checking in to see how they are going. For some reason, the trainers were not even allowed to email students with important information, like the date and times of webinars. And they were only allowed phone consultations with students as long as it doesn't exceed 15 minutes..ASQA has recently reviewed the course too, and the outcome was that Open Colleges now has to change the course and its practices.I am so truly disappointed. I was hoping to upskill to return to work after a break raising kids. But I can't possibly put this on my CV as it holds no worth. I‚Äôm now studying at a post graduate level at uni to try and make up for wasting my time and money on this dinky little open colleges course."
2,2019-10-14T02:09:44.000Z,Terrible. No Support. Poor Communication. Shocking attitude from some trainers.,"I was thoroughly enjoying the course for about the first 12 months. There were 4 trainers and they were all very helpful and supportive, nothing was too much trouble and the communication was great. However, all this changed when 3 trainers left and we were left with one who was still helpful but only marked a few of my remaining papers and the other was terrible. It took days for her to respond and when she did the answer was usually "" I don't know"" ""if you can find the paper or info then I cant""Appointments were made to carry out one-one Skype calls and then she mixed up the times and didn't call when arranged or did and then it was immediately obvious she hadn't even read my assignment prior to calling. Her unhelpful, careless attitude came across in communication in the online platform.In October 2019 we were given 3 weeks to submit all remaining assignments for the course by text and email from OC. For many students this meant they were only able to finish half the course. We were told the course was no longer going to continue and really OC should not of enrolled any new students knowing that the course is 2.5 years long. The lack of consistent communication, clear advice and instructions have left many like myself extremely frustrated and angry. I was lucky to of been 2 weeks away from completing mine when I received the text message.I finished this diploma because I wanted to gain the qualification. But I honestly wish I'd spent my money with a different training provider. I would never spend money on another Open Colleges study program again."
4,2019-10-11T21:23:13.000Z,Great,"The context and support provided throughout my course was fantastic, only then things got a little messy were with my placement catch ups but we sorted those out in the end. So happy I completed my course through Open Colleges."

It took a lot of pressure off me knowing I was working in my own time and if I needed to deal with unforeseen issues, which come up all the time, I could put the course on hold for a few days.  The support was great when needed.   For me personally this was the best way to study."
5,2019-10-11T02:52:15.000Z,Great experience,"I had a lot of support throughout my course from the assessors, you have to take into consideration that the assessors are marking thousands of peoples work so you have to be understanding when you're waiting up to 2 days for feedback, or to be marked.Overall I really enjoyed the course, they made it even more engaging by adding in videos etc.I'll happily go through open colleges again if I decide to study further"

Her methods get results and her teaching of key skills are second to none , I have been employed for 12 months and still when her students do placement where I am employed all the bosses speak so highly of them and their training . The best choice I ever made was this course and I can not recommend it or this particular instructor more highly , she knows her stuff and by the end of your course so will you , thank you Austcare and Michelle at Hervey Bay"

I enrolled in Diploma of Social Media Marketing and paid for the full cost of the course upfront, within two months of starting I have 2 major life changes happening at the same time and became highly stressed and unable to study. I supplied all the documentation they asked for in order to get a refund and after I supplied very personal documentation they refused my refund, not even a partial refund."

And you are assessed on things that you aren‚Äôt taught but expected to know that AGAIN DO NOT HAVE ANY RELEVANCE TO THE COURSE! open colleges has done nothing but undermine the students that want these issues fixed! they solely just want our money!

What are you paying for??  wait times for marking are long as staff are leaving, inconsistent marking, grading a competency based course, condescendingly told they would explain the difference between competency and tertiary education when I asked for marking key as it was being graded!

They have conned and now sending my daughter financially broke. They lie when they write back to you about having read your emails letters etc. At no point do you feel as though you are communicating with an education provider, more like loan sharks. Beware stay away pay attention to those who have had their lives changed by debt not education."
4,2019-09-19T05:46:15.000Z,"Supportive, responsive and OC staff was very helpful.","I have graduated from OC few years ago, I studied Allied Health Assistance. I found that OC was quite good, I know that the assessments were a little bit overwhelming especially the video assignment part but in the end, all worth it. I always reached out the assessor when I found difficulty to finish the assessments and they were very helpful. I only waited for 24 hours the longest time to get the response. They were very responsive. Regarding the placement, I found that the last assignments and videos were a little too much, I had to do writing assessments, presentation, and interview over the phone for the very last one before they marked the whole course to grant the certificate. The coordination between OC and my work placement were very good, they approved my application to do the placement and OC staff did the other paperwork and I started my placement few weeks later as it was during Christmas break and New Year. I didn't wait for months to get approved for my placement. I know to find the work placement was not easy, after few attempts to apply finally I found one at a special school under OT supervision. I finished the course within 10 months includes 5 weeks Christmas and New Year's break. Over all, my experience with Open Colleges is quite good, it is not easy for online study you have to work hard, focus, and perseverance but the most important  thing is the support from the institution that we need the most. Thank you OC for your support during my study, now I am working in a health sector as a nurse."

I receive it back because the point spacing wasn‚Äôt correct. I was told to put the assignment onto a precise amount of pages. NOWHERE did it mention point spacing. After going onto the next maze of assessments, I had to go back to do the assessment again and guess how to make it on the right amount of pages.All to prove I can write an email."

I chose open colleges because living rurally, I didn't have many options. Like many others, I found employers think nothing of their qualifications, it's near impossible to get work experience, and their staff turn over constantly."
3,2019-09-15T06:46:52.000Z,"2.5 stars. Poor support, lots of work/detail in assessments and pretty average course material.","Course material is very general and assessments are very detailed. Large portions of the assessments require you to do your own research to be able to complete them as the information needed is not included in the course material. You will need to be able to work independently as assessments are vague and little guidance or direction is given upfront. I found this very frustrating at times. When you do reach out to assessors, response times are slow which can be very inconvenient and interrupt your progress significantly. Generally the course content was relevant and informative and the assessments were thorough so I developed some good knowledge and skills that I can apply in my role at work. However, proper and detailed explanation of assessments needs to be provided to students upfront instead of just expecting them to reach out for support, when the support options and access to assessors isn't great. Overall, I would rate my experience with Open Colleges as 2.5 stars."
5,2019-09-15T04:16:48.000Z,Leadership and Management,"I recently finished my Diploma of Leadership and Management. I agree it was hard work, but completely worth the effort.I don't understand a lot of the negative reviews here. You're all adults, responsible for your own learning. Don't expect the answers to your assessments to be spoon fed to you like a child. You either want to learn - or you just want a 'qualification' without learning a damn thing. If being responsible for your own training and meeting assessment deadlines is not for you, then do your course in a classroom, not online.If you do want to learn, online course create that opportunity. They are not meant to be easy. They are meant to challenge you, make you want to read and research and read some more. But if you just want someone to give you an easy pathway to a qualification without actually showing that you learned anything at all, then online courses like this are not for you.Those of you looking for a 'tick and flick' course, without actually using your brains, can get those 'qualifications' almost anywhere. But really they mean nothing more than the paper they are printed on. If you want to actually learn then you need to apply yourself and that takes time and effort, which many of you don't seem to want to bother with.I want to thank my assessor, Simon, for his support and encouragement to do better. His feedback was really helpful and helped target the areas that I need to do more research and improve my knowledge.Now I have a Diploma that I can proudly know that I genuinely earned without just demanding Open Colleges do all the work for me."

I have had asked for other options to pay the rest, but their process is ring the college and then fill a form out and then they will get back to you in 2 weeks or so.... and most of the time they are just wasting your time.I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO TO OPEN COLLEGES!!"

The course I did (Diploma of Graphic Design) seems way out of date, pointless, and bloated with filler tasks that prove to have any use or logic behind them. And if you dare to question the course content, there's really no help given. The trainer might reply to you a few days after your question, but the response is pretty much bloated filler too. They say they're happy to help, but don't really give any help (one trainer in particular anyway).My quick version, there's some useful parts of the course, but the amount of filler tasks is ridiculous. This diploma needs an update bad. And the further you get into the course the worse it gets, the last two assignments are as pointless as you can get."

The trainers and assessors were very helpful and understanding, they gave me constructive and positive feedback. I would definitely recommend Open Colleges to anyone looking to study on line."
3,2019-09-11T04:42:12.000Z,Flexible study arrangements but too many tutors,"Having flexibility to study when I wanted (or could) was one of the reasons for undertaking study through Open Colleges. The support from fellow students was outstanding and one of the reasons I would consider a second course of study! Throughout the course however, I had three different tutors.  For a newbie it was a little confusing who was responsible for what.  The last tutor, we weren't officially notified about (or I missed the post), just saw her name appear on assessment queries and made the link. The standards between the tutors was different as was their time to respond to queries.  Please set the standards for turnaround times so that we don't expect too much."

What a load of BS. I could understand the need for so much drawing if I was doing Interior ""Design"", but my course it titled ""Decoration"".The correlation between the course notes and the requirement for each assignment is ludicrous.  The notes are basic, say level 1  and the demands of each assignment are like Level 10. Such a waste of time and money.PS I have just read the review below by Teresa, who was doing a Cert 4 in Web Design.  Her experience is scarily similar to mine.

However once I did it just turned into a fight. Open Colleges had a policy on a 5 work-day return on written assessments, yet they took on average 30 working days, then they changed their policy to 10working day return which their assessors still couldn't stick to. A lot of their assessment requirements were misleading, meaning a lot of written assessments came back to me saying they were wrong and when I asked for clarification I got no response. A lot of the questions in the written assessments were not in the study modules and I note down everything, so it wasn't like I had missed something so many times. All together, Open Colleges was a very difficult company to work with, and to top it off I had to get a refund because they took more out of my account then they should have"

Open Colleges will not assist you with finding placement unless you provide a ridiculous level of evidence and forms.

It can take upwards of 2 weeks just to organise a simple phone call with them. I have had several incidents where I have commenced an assessment and then they have changed the criteria without making any effort to inform me and then marking my work 'inadmissable'. Upon me waiting upwards of 2 weeks to actually get on the phone to someone who can do something (which I have to take time off work for), they look at my assessment and pass me, without so much as a sorry for wasting my time. The most frustrating, drawn-out and rage-inducing process I have ever been through. On top of this I paid a lot of money for this service and have received zero support throughout the last two years, simply told to book in a phone call.

Most support staff on phone wonderful however a few rude experiences including being accused of forgery (no apology - email removed however).  Recommend do your course with an organisation that you can work with the people not online.   This course was personal to me due to my elderly father who has advanced dementia - this course is not relative nor assessed well.   Many, many repeats of the same requirements - crazy.Graduated now however would say not a pleasant learning experience at all, and will not do more with Open Colleges in the future."

3,2019-09-04T07:27:40.000Z,Room for Improvement,"I found quite a few of the modules difficult to negotiate and use. An example of this were assessments using a Powerpoint presentation which required placement of symbols or icons (eg: a task requiring setting up classroom furniture). Often, accessing the assessments was fiddly - sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Actually working within documents was also strange - sometimes it was a cut and paste that didn't always work. Sometimes it was dragging the mouse. With perseverance they worked, but it could be frustrating and time consuming. Assessments were not always easily available and obvious - some searching was required to locate and figure out what to do / the assessment helpers etc.I still do not understand the ""search"" function. No matter what I typed into search, in which screen or module, the results were either nil, or irrelevant.Assessments took a long time to be marked. This was frustrating and not in accordance with the ""10 day turnaround"" that is advertised.There is a lot of reading, which of course is to be expected with this type of training, however more videos, and indeed even videos of some topics being taught in a classroom environment would make the course so much nicer to complete.I felt the trainers/assessors often gave stock standard (and unhelpful) answers to questions being asked on the forum. Quite often I would read a response (not necessarily to my own question), and was still left wondering.On the upside, I really appreciated the quick responses I received to my private questions. These were answered promptly and I received lovely encouragement.I feel the system is a bit ""clunky"" and there's a lot of room for improvement - in navigating the space, accessing modules and understanding requirements. Unfortunately I didn't write down examples as I went through the course as it didn't occur to me, but I wish I could have so I could provide them now. But generally, it was just an overall feel that the website felt ""clunky"" and not as professional and polished as it should be.I think this type of learning is a great concept - ideal for busy people, perhaps who are juggling young families and a job etc. It does not suit people who are unable to motivate themselves as it requires a lot of discipline to sit at a computer for long periods of time and read."

If you're not self-motivated, this isn't the course for you. If you are however, and can commit to a regular study schedule, you will do well.The tutors were generally very helpful, Justine in particular - excellent.There were some assessments that weren't as valid for me given I didn't want to use this to set up a GD business, but to add to my existing toolkit. Instead of doing business plans I would have preferred to have more design tasks to complete.I'm so happy that my study is finished for now and I can begin to put my skills to use in my employment and to create my own personal artwork."

And since making these complaints, I have started receiving emails of support.... it's an absolute joke and I will NEVER recommend this company to anybody. If you are keen on paying $7k+ and then receive no contact or support, then this is the company for you. From the money they receive your money, you will receive nothing.*EDIT* - Are you kidding???

I found the modules on how to create a website through CSS really difficult if you've never done this before. I'm not sure how much a graphic designer in the real world would really create these from scratch. The OpenForum is a great concept, however it would have been helpful if trainers commented more when students ask for feedback. I also suggest, that when students complete this course, they should receive an email of congratulations first, before receiving an email to submit feedback. Overall, this course will greatly benefit me throughout my career."
3,2019-08-29T23:10:06.000Z,Assessors of Building and Construction - Excellent,"Average my seem like a harsh grade and it was only because you didn't have the option of good, however this does not reflect on the assessors that put in countless hours assisting and grading our assignments. If the mark was for these people alone, it would most definitely be 'Excellent'.Course content/information was good, although some of the links referred to international builders, this is where I'd like to see more Australian content.The reason why I marked 'Average' was due to the countless broken links, the grammatical errors within text and assignments and otherwise poor housekeeping of information. A lot of time was time back and forth clarifying these issues, informing IT/Student services of errors which as you can appreciate was quite time consuming and frustrating to say the least. In saying this though IT and Student services were always quick to reply, sometimes with a fix and sometimes not.I'm sure though if these were addressed and minimised to even 50% of what was encountered, this would be a very good course.In saying all this though I did enjoy the course and it was great to see that they now able to provide to all states of Australia. Once again thank you to all of the Assessors for their time and knowledge they afforded me (which included their weekends), very much appreciated."

4,2019-08-19T23:40:53.000Z,Great!!!,"I have found Open Colleges great to study with! I have just completed my certificate 4 in disability through them. There is always pros and cons to any form of studying, be that in a class room or online. So I will start with the cons of studying online and end on a positive note.1. Waiting for modules to unlock - this was slightly annoying as I had paid for my entire course upfront however wasn‚Äôt given access to all the modules until I completed a full module. This was also an issue with after completing a module the next one would not unlock until after the assessment was marked or I would have to call support to unlock it earlier if I wanted to continue studying while my assessment was marked. Could understand if I was on a payment plan, however considering I paid upfront I would of preferred access to the entire course and modules at once unless I requested otherwise. However a positive of this was working one by one through each module was not overwhelming and kept me focussed on the one topic at a time.2. Assessments being marked - when I started the course in January 2018 it was a turn around of 5 business days to have assessments marked. On completion of the course the turnaround was over a month. On a positive note communication was generally well kept between open colleges and students. They would regularly post in the forum advising of the backlog and as why and they had a great online person to chat with who was always very helpful.3. Communication between 1 teacher and myself was not fantastic. I had a few questions I was stuck on in an assessment to which I messaged through open colleges and also through email and never got a response. On a positive note another teacher was extremely fast and helpful. I had messaged enquiring when my last two assessments would be marked as I needed my qualification for a job promotion I was going for and he responded by the end of that day with both assessments marked. Could not have been happier!4. Studying online vs classroom. I personally prefer studying in a classroom environment simply because I stay on track, committed and the help of the teachers and other students are there all the time and the predictability and reliability of help and finishing the course on time. However studying online with open colleges was fantastic as a recently single mum of 3 young children and working part time shift work it was great not to have the pressure of having to attend classrooms, miss out on work or shuffling childcare.5. Open colleges was very accommodating. There were some technical issues that prevented students from being able to access assessments. As the assessment I was trying to access was my last assessment and my course was about to expire they gave me an extra 2 months free of charge to be able to complete it.6. The absolute highlight of my time studying with open colleges was the opportunity to go to Fiji for 2 weeks and complete my work placement hours over there in the Fijian community. Very reasonably priced, living with locals and an experience I will forever be grateful for and will never forget. Students and teachers were amazing and the work being done over there is inspiring."

Very interesting though not practical for the times we are in.)The tutors were helpful, particularly Jeffrey Happlin; always quick to answer emails and would even call you to help. In saying this i was disappointed in another tutor that wouldn't answer emails (waiting for weeks).All in all a good experience that suits a fast or slow pace depending on how much time you have.

MORE if you had Jana who thankfully has now left, so  i would like to say things improved once she had gone but i was at the end of the course by then so can not say. I even applied for an extension due to her slowness and lack of professionalism towards this job.  When i signed up to this course it was only 5 days, if i had known they were to double the wait time i would of not gone with Open Colleges.. Michelle and Sharon have been an absolute joy however! if i had of been working with them and not the snarky, rude and extensively late Jana i would not of marked the whole College as so low. The Course work is repetitive and dose not include a first aid course which all employees need to do for this role so why would you not include it! Being online you rely on their website to be fully functioning which it often is not! uploads are slow, downloads not always available."

Additionally, some of the course activities had not been updated for some time. It is a little disappointing knowing that you paid for certain services and they are not maintained regularly."
2,2019-08-12T03:48:20.000Z,Average experience,I thought the teacher was amazing but that‚Äôs where it stopped. Having different Intakes at different times on the same course I and other people In the class found it confusing and distracting that people were at different levels. I also thought that communication between the college and student while on work placement was very poor. Also communication after work placement was minimal which made finishing the course take a lot longer then it should have. Also communication with admin was badly organised regarding payments. I personally would not recommend open colleges to anybody in the future.
5,2019-08-12T02:12:35.000Z,Definitely worth it!,"Supportive, self-paced learning with assessors that provide encouragement and valuable insights on topics assessed.I would recommend Open Colleges. The course content was challenging, up to date and presented in a stimulating manner.One suggestion though - response to emails querying assessment requirements is too slow (sometimes waiting up to 10 days for response)"

I changed my phone and computer trying to fix this but it persisted. All I did was take a 5 minute video on a IPhone and the only way I could upload it to open colleges was either through sending a USB which took over a month to upload or Google play which took over 5 hours to upload.It should not be such a stress to upload files. Apart from that I really enjoyed the experience Thank you so much Deidre and Inneke you guys are greatJason

However the information on learning difficulties, in particular Dyslexia is outdated and not in line with current research and best practice.

3,2019-08-07T09:59:23.000Z,Great content and set out but there were too many video presentations,"The content was set out really well and I enjoyed the learning side of things. I enjoyed the layout of information broken by videos. I also liked the diagrams as it helped my understanding of information. However, there were so many videos and I had many complications uploading my videos. Having a video link on how to compress videos on different devices would be helpful if not already in place. I would have liked to know before the course started that there were so many videos. If there were another way of doing these presentation assessments that would be much better. Even possibly doing a document taking photos of start middle and end of a task instead to minimise the videos. Also it usually took me a day to upload my videos which is time consuming and could have been spent on completing more content and finishing the course faster."

This is my second Diploma with them and my first experience was very positive. However it appears they have lost their ability to appropriately manage and support their students. An absolute shemozzle this time around so unless you like chasing up this College several times to gain any traction for anything. Don‚Äôt use them.

They take money from accounts outside of the agreed schedules and refuse to refund. I signed up for Open Colleges in 2015. FOUR YEARS AGO!!! I have had letters from my doctor stating I am unable to study due to working full time and an ongoing psychological injury and they did not want me overwhelmed by adding full time work into the mix. Since being denied the right to cease study I have had to pay every fortnight. The stress from this was also included in my suicide letter because they threatened me with debt collectors after I had been off work for a month with a further psychological injury caused by domestic violence. Do NOT go through this company. They are a gross representation of a place to study.Thanks for taking money outside of the agreed schedule. NOT!!!!!

1,2019-08-01T13:26:12.000Z,Very poorly constructed course‚Ä¶ complete waste of time and money.,"Very poorly constructed course materials. Limited support. Have to wait days to receive any guidance on questions. Typically are forced to wait weeks to receive any feedback on assignments. Even if it is a  simple rewording of a single question they requested. A period of 3 months no staff were employed to mark assignments.  Assessments so poorly worded that industry professionals I sought out for assistance could not decipher what they were asking. No support with practical placements. There have been multiple issues with their technology. I will be filing an ombudsman complaint. This has been a complete was of time, money and stress. I will be re-enrolling in the same course with a different company. After scrolling trough a few pages of the other reviews on this website I can see Open Colleges have responded more quickly to these reviews than they ever have to course enquires or assessments. Perhaps if they focused more on providing a good student experience they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about managing reviews so much."
2,2019-08-01T09:51:35.000Z,Some course modules not appropriate,"The course was pitched too high in many instances.  There was little support from markers and availability to discuss matters was limited to certain hours of the day which does not suit when you are running a business.  The last module on business management was too difficult.  I had to enlist the assistance of a qualified accountant who also had issues with the way the assignment was worded and the expectations of the markers.  Markers also became sarcastic and unhelpful when more information was requested to assist in learning.  Online learning is difficult enough without resorting to sarcasm.  Some assignments had 'excellent and outstanding, comprehensive answer"" on feedback to only get a pass.  Not a great experience all in all."
1,2019-08-01T00:07:10.000Z,Appalling,"Appalling. I studied Certificate IV in Disability. The course content was riddled with errors. The assessments were not well planned, contained many errors and took up to 27 business days to be marked. I did my placement with no support even though I contacted the school multiple times desperately asking for my checkpoints to be scheduled. I am utterly disgusted and would NOT recommend it to anyone."

I was easily able to access everything through the internet and was able to work full time and be able to study when it suited me, and at my own pace. I found the trainers and assessors that I worked with throughout my course, very helpful and supportive and would definitely recommend studying through Open Colleges to others."
1,2019-07-31T02:39:58.000Z,Underwhelming to say the least.,"Would not recommend!Marking feedback is ridiculously slow.Content is not always relevant to assignment questions.Assignment questions are so ambiguous, then teacher response is so delayed when you do email.Would never enrol in another course here again.Platform through which they deliver content is always malfunctioning and makes it incredibly difficult to complete anything in a timely manner."
5,2019-07-30T09:16:59.000Z,Open Colleges - Great way to study online,Open Colleges was the perfect RTO for me.  Being able to study at my own pace whilst working full time was a bonus.  The course challenged and motivated me to improve my learning as well as assisting in my current employment.  Open Space was easy to navigate and as well as communicating with student support and assessors.  I found the webinars informative and helpful when preparing for assessments.  I also appreciated receiving credits towards my tuition for subjects that I received RPL for.  Online learning is not for everyone however I found it to be the right choice for my needs.  I would recommend Open Colleges and would use them again for any future learning needs.

I had excellent support during all my study period and every time I need help to solve any issue I had someone promptly to help me.

3,2019-07-27T06:44:43.000Z,Education Assistants course,i found the process of opening new subjects very arduous you have to email to get a course opened I think there should be a tab in the website that could make it an easier process. 2 staff left during my course time frame and didn't seem to be replaced which meant that it took more than 10 days to get results back for most examinations. the content that you spent a lot of time reading through could be broken down into more memorable subjects and could be addressed better in some of the assessments. I feel over qualified for what I am applying for in theory but without the practical side of the course its hard to get a job. The practical part of the course could be spread out from the beginning of the course and it would have been better to do it at more than one location I felt like I was limited in my experiences in the one class room for 120 hours.overall I found the course easy to flow through sometimes I missed assessments not sure how but it is quite difficult to track your assessments as they are graded and mixed up in the grades page.when I spoke with the trainers they were always very helpful and happy to help in anyway they could.
1,2019-07-27T00:17:00.000Z,Open Colleges: Such a Frustrating Experience,"To frame my review, I will mention first that I have a masters degree in another field.  I say this because it's easy to dismiss a review and say to yourself that this person must not be very smart if she couldn't figure this out.  I'm pretty smart and I was quite disappointed with this whole process.  I was enrolled in a program and I was unaware they were not done planning the coursework.  I was told I could finish at my own pace, but then they had not finished the course, so in fact I had to wait on the release.  I kept thinking I was done with the certificate since I'd finished all the assignments I could access, and they just kept releasing new assignments.  I also had issues getting things approved for my workplace hours.  The process was not streamlined on their end, and you have to wait 10 business days for most things.  I found that on the 10th day, they would tell me something I needed to do.  I'd do it and then have to wait 10 more business days for the next step.  Very frustrating when you are trying to do things efficiently.  I was told incorrect/unclear information by their office and it added even more time on.  I had issues with some assessments because they include open-ended questions.  Well, when you ask an open-ended question, you need to expect a range of answers that could be considered correct.  I found that I could answer questions correctly, and because it was not exactly what they wanted, I was marked ""unsatisfactory.""  For example, I was marked unsatisfactory when I wrote that an Aboriginal man, who was released from jail and settled in a new city, would experience a financial challenge when it comes to health and leisure.  Everyone has financial barriers and limits.  This was apparently not an acceptable answer even though it is true.  This was an incredibly frustrating process, and I am soooo glad I am finally finished.  I will never go through open colleges again."
5,2019-07-26T22:08:20.000Z,Happy Graduate,All of the staff members were so helpful with anything I needed in my Certificate III Business Administration and the OpenSpace was so easy to navigate so it wasn‚Äôt stressful at all and it was great to know that you could have study buddies as well.

2,2019-07-25T02:09:52.000Z,Open Colleges,"Open Colleges' online learning system for the course I completed had not been updated in years. Reference links were broken, references themselves were out-of-date. In this current age, learning materials should be the most recent available. Secondly, workload was excessive for a Certificate III. Having completed a BSc(Hons) and Grad Dip I should know. This may be because it was fully online, but there are better ways to test knowledge than repetitive, time-consuming busy work. Time taken to mark assignments was average. Ability to book phone calls with tutors was difficult due to them being fully booked a month in advance.Go elsewhere."

When you do call or email for help, maybe an email will come back a few days later, a call will end up in a queue of people then have to state all your details, then wait for a call back! Sometimes you can't even get through the line at all!The course material is difficult in itself and they require videos of you performing tasks, it's very embarrassing.There is no help finding work experience, unless you have tried 10 places and failed, which then have to fill out a huge protocol of items in order for them to even help you. No one comes to your work placement to watch you, it's just a phone call assessment, which i found quite unprofessional.It's really been an exhausting experience, oh and if you don't finish in time, they want to charge you more, can you believe that?I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."

I was encouraged to keep pushing through and have been rewarded by finishing my course well and truly prior to my own expectations.I would recommend this training organisation to anyone with the confidence to tackle courses online. It is a different method of study that requires commitment, but once you have mastered communication with the trainers, you will have the opportunity to bring the classroom to your home.Thank you Open Colleges staff for your support and encouragement!!!"

Student support were very good with what information they could give up. Then when it can to my work placement, well what a joke, thank goodness that my workplace supervisor was so patient. There was far to many videos to be done, My time and my supervisors time was taken up with role playing instead of watching my supervisor work or getting hands on experience,  then there was the check point interview where I was made to feel like a fool."
3,2019-07-18T00:15:54.000Z,My review,"Some of the wording in assessments was really confusing, and sometimes covered topics we had not studied yet or just worded poorly. Personally, I work better brainstorming with people so that would have been better for me - wish there was more of a student group chat to talk to other students, not just the message board. Wish that assessment marking was done in a faster manner but things are constantly improving."

Also the Student Support team for mentoring me on the journey.The only thing that would like to recommend; is that Module 12, and how it set up.

3,2019-07-07T04:50:29.000Z,Study Online Again Using Open Colleges...Probably Not,It was definitely not what I was expecting they take a long time to mark your assessments they have 10 business days to complete it and most usually take longer. When you have 38 assessments that takes up a lot of your time waiting for that. And they really aren't that helpful when you are stuck they just send you back to what you've already read and tell you to read again. I learnt a lot from this and patience was probably the biggest thing. And a lot of the assessments don't make sense you can't read it as a whole you need to do it one question by one question.

Studying online can often be tricky, however Student Support & the Assessors were always there to help & no question was ever to big or small to answer. I always felt the feedback I received from my assessments was thorough & guiding & if I ever had questions, the teachers were always happy to help. Studying online takes discipline, however I enjoyed being part of the online community, speaking to student support via the chat function & having direct email access to my teachers.

Much of my knowledge was obtained by researching online as the content provided was not substantial to correctly answer the assessments.  I finished ALL course requirements within the 12 month timeline however, due to Open College's ability to provide available and COMPETENT assessors, they continually marked my work as unsatisfactory - justified with offensively absurd excuses - to try and delay my completion. For 6 months I was harrassed to pay ""extension"" fees whilst I struggled to get a response to a multitude of emails begging for support, or even a timely response.  Timely communication from the majority of staff was absolutely appalling and I had to threaten formal complaint via TEQSA to get any action.  Please carefully consider spending your money and your time with this RTO. They are substandard!  They grab your money upfront, then hang you out to dry.  Be warned!!!"

It is hard to get information out of these people. Course material and assignments are very repetitive. Instead of taking of marks for your assignment they will make you resubmit for the tiniest thing

The application of finding your own work placement & writing your own applications was of value & co-ordinating the assessment of this was good. Great friendly & experienced team.I think there is room for people to have lots of problems & dramas with the online platform but if you put a bit of work into getting the experience you need so you are not biased against for studying this way not in a classroom then you should be fine.

I work full time and this meant I was able to complete my work at night and on weekends which is the only way this would work for me.Any questions I asked were answered quickly and the assessors / trainers were thorough. The only roadblocks I found were my own time management and motivations!

The assessor is really nice and helpful but takes ages to get back to us or mark an assessment and all of that is time consuming. I enrolled in this course because I work and don‚Äôt have much time so thought it‚Äôs a good idea to study online but it wasn‚Äôt the case few times took the day off to study got stuck with something called support team they did nothing and said ask the assessor even though it wasn‚Äôt an academic question and I told them the assessor will take at least a week to get back to me and I took the day off to finish the assessments and they did nothing. Very very upset not good experience at all.
4,2019-06-17T06:11:01.000Z,The Flexibility of Self-Paced Study,"It was really great to be able to study at my own pace with Open Colleges which allows you to completely pace your own study schedule without any set deadlines.The format of learning was straightforward and expectations clearly defined. It was easy to get in touch with support personnel when required and a response was usually not far away.The course that I chose went hand in hand with practical workplace experience and suited my job role well. I don't know if I would have found this course as constructive if it didn't apply to every day work life.The turnaround time for receiving feedback on assessments was great up until the last module. Usually I'd receive feedback within one or two business days, however, with the last assessment it took a lot longer, over a month due to the lack of an assessor to grade my work. This experience, whilst disappointing, has not discouraged me from studying with Open Colleges again and I likely will. The pros outweigh the cons by far.My advice to anyone wanting to study is to leave procrastination station as soon as you arrive and get it done!"
4,2019-06-16T09:26:07.000Z,Gotta love a study!,"Open Colleges supplied fairly good training. In the beginning some information was a bit difficult to come by and it was a bit tricky getting hold of the right people to get other information from, but I ended up with a new assessor who was absolutely brilliant. It made the experience so much easier just being able to be pointed straight to someone who was so eager to pass on his knowledge. I would recommend Open Colleges to anyone keen for flexible learning."
1,2019-06-13T22:47:35.000Z,Think twice before you enroll!,"Very poor student support- 48 working hours to get back with answers from student support, can‚Äôt contact them directly - messages go to voicemail.10 working days to mark an assessment!!! - seems like not enough qualified trainers/assesors and too many students to me.Modules don‚Äôt unlock automatically after submitting assessments as promised in student materials. You have to beg your assessor to do that for you - and of course they‚Äôre not available 24/7 so you can get stuck (nights, weekends, public holidays, ect.)Work placement is a disaster, very poor structure planning and even if you find yourself suitable workplace you have to wait for approval (again 10 working days). The workplace supervisors can‚Äôt contact student support directly either. Wishes circle of waiting and everyone is pretty fed up. My work placement approving supervisor went on a month long holiday while I was in process of approval and she didn‚Äôt let me know, nor contacted my new-to-be work place supervisor. I lost a whole month of practical work, not to mention, my new workplace supervisor lost interest in training me because she was eventually fed up with the whole process and neglect.I have finally finished my course but I won‚Äôt be recommending Open Colleges to anyone.I reckon it‚Äôs a great business charging people for online student material and not spending enough money on required amount of trained staff, assesors and supervisor.Just my view."

My impression is that they are going through either a period of change perhaps with staffing or reinventing their practices. I‚Äôm certain it will pick up. Overall I am happy with the delivery of their training, the options for payment and the variety of courses they offer. Definitely makes it easier for a work life balance especially working full time and raising a family"
1,2019-06-08T14:22:14.000Z,Disability Certificate 3,I started my Disability course with open colleges in 2018 and I had no help from the start. Course content was of no use and all mixed up. I would contact for support and did not receive a response for 3 months... twice. Which alternatively put me behind in studies and therefore could not complete it in time but open colleges still demanded their money even though all that was supplied was study material.My results wouldn‚Äôt come back for 4 weeks at a time aswell.I suggest never doing a course online and always doing it face to face. This review is legitimate. This company is not worth the money you‚Äôre better off at TAFE NSW.

I took longer than I had planned to complete the course and was so grateful to OC assistance to extend my course. It was hard going back to study and having to juggle family, my health, work and studies. This course was more than I had imagined. It not only set tasks to learn photography skills but also how to set up a business. As I was just starting my own business it was such a great addition.It is not a teach you take photographs A-Z course. On the basis that you have an existing knowledge base, it teaches you build on this to find your own genre and strengths to set you up as a successful photographer. At times it was very challenging and I spent hours doing research and setting up shoots. You get out of this course what you put into it.On the negative side some of the course assessments were hard to follow and not having a class with a tutor, it was at times confusing to know what to ask from the questions which were a bit ambiguous. I spent a long time trying to figure things out. But the help was there when I needed it.Improvements - Knowing where to post work for successful feedback would be great and more information upfront about things like the Facebook page would be good.Other than that I highly recommend the course to people who want to hone their exisiting skills and set up a photography business with an added qualification."

They were encouraging and help to take me to a level I didn‚Äôt think I could do! I couldn‚Äôt fault them!My peers on the Facebook page were amazing! It was like we really came to know each other and the encouragement and inspiration  from them was a highlight of the course.

I have worked in the field for 8 years and the entirety of my studies with Open, the content seemed lacking, was wrong in a lot of situations, factually incorrect with regard to the way it forces you to make assumptions with little to no data on hand, when dealing with accounting this results in a very drastic spectrum of possible answers. However, because of my background in the field perhaps I was over complicating the subject matte due to real world experiences.I do need to honestly thank and commend the assesors, one in particular being Ruchi Makkar, she was always on hand for my queries, no questions asked. She helped me through a tough patch where I was strongly doubting completion of the diplomas. If you are lucky enough to have Ruchi support you in any way, you will get through it."

This phone conversation, was the only guidance I received throughout my 2.5 years studying with them. The only time I heard from Open Colleges is when they sent an email out asking me to complete a survey and I could win an ipad.When I completed my final Portfolio, it took 3 months to get a response saying that they were going to extend my course by another 3 months, in order to give them enough time to mark everything. 2 months and 1 week later, I got a response. From someone who I had never been dealing with. Why? Because my original Assessor had left the company. And the only reason I found this out, was going onto the online Portal and noticing that the email was no longer active. Who knows when the person left, as none of my emails were ever responded to.DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING WITH OPEN COLLEGESYes, they are online and it is a good option when you work full time, but the lack of communication is extremely off putting.

This was my first time studying online, and I think it could go quickly if you manage your time, dedicate some time to specifically be studying and doing assessments.I think the only thing that you miss out on is the hands on help and when you're learning it's always good to learn around people with experience because they are able to teach you nifty tricks and give you extra information. But if that's not possible when you're studying online I think."

I found the content good very helpful for my workforce but I was really disappointed with Sanet and her level of assistance during the whole course and accountability. The other staff that I spoke to for assistance and extensions due to not being able to get help from my teacher- I found them all very apologetic and helpful even thought they weren‚Äôt familiar with the disability content.

1,2019-05-26T23:41:09.000Z,I will not be enrolling with Open Colleges,"I will not be enrolling with Open Colleges. I was considering the financial options after speaking with an education ""consultant"" and because he kept emailing me to make a decision I told him he can close the enquiry. Then a week later sends an email full of attitude ""due to my lack of response"". I WAS going to choose Open Colleges but this email made me read these other reviews and I will definitely NOT be enrolling with you now. Your first point of contacts with potential and existing clients can be your success or your failure. Good luck."

The 'quiz' questions are by far more in depth than just a quiz.The assignment questions in some instances were not clear. The formatting of answering the long questions was terrible... I did not find this course much fun at all."

From some trainers never writing back to questions on assessments, or and taking weeks to respond to messages, to having to fight to get my diploma after graduating. I had a terrible experience which caused stress and made it harder to complete my studies. Will never choose them again. The only positive was one trainer Tracey who was lovely, prompt and efficient. If it wasn‚Äôt for Tracey I would have rated zero stars. Open Colleges is lucky to have Tracey."

4,2019-05-23T02:16:48.000Z,A good grounding in Graphic Design,"The website is clear and easy to use.  It really needs a feedback section to report dead links and errors in the content (typos and grammatical errors).  I'd also like to see some sort of differentiation in the sections I'd visited and the ones I'd not seen yet.  Perhaps a different colour?The Graphic Design course itself was good - it's definitely aimed at getting the student ready to work as a freelance graphic designer.  There was an annoying emphasis on recorded interviews with peers (at least 1 per assignment) and I would've liked to see more actual *design* rather than marketing, project management etc.  But overall it did give a good basic grounding in graphic design at a Diploma level.It was pretty anonymous - the tutor interaction (for me) was limited to a couple of brief questions about assignments and feedback from the actual assignments.  I would've liked having a bit more scheduled interaction where the tutor 'checks in' to monitor progress.Student Support were brilliant - prompt to respond and really helpful.I would do another Open Colleges course."

Be prepared though to dip into your own pockets to buy materials as most aren't provided - it was okay for me as I will be using these for my lawn mowing business. It would have been good to have more than one lecturer marking as it would make the course faster. Any issues with Admin side of things were also quickly resolved.
5,2019-05-22T00:02:54.000Z,After using several providors,"After using several providors, Open Space was the most user-friendly.The dashboard showing your completion rate is an excellent tool and, not unlocking one module until you've finished the previous one is an excellent management tool to help keep self-directed learners on course.One little improvement would probably be if you could speak to your teacher rather than just dealing over email all the time."

1,2019-05-21T12:34:24.000Z,Hated it,"Had to pay $6500 for a course I never did.. the way they explained it to me is I sign up and do a trial then have a cooling off period where I get to choose if I complete the course. After I signed up they told me my cooling off period had expired and whether I continue with the course or not I still owe the money. None of this was explained to me that once I signed up I had to pay the money. When I tried to contact someone about leaving the course noone ever returned my calls or when they did I got the same answer that the cooling period is over. Didn't complete the course. Still had to pay $6500 over 2 and a half years and all they did was threaten to send my case to debt collectors.$6500 for nothing. I also found the site hard to navigate. I asked for refunds as I wasn't in a state of mind of how overwhelming online study was with no assistance, after constant  calls,  my final response was the only reason I could get a refund was if I was critically ill with a terminal illness. I applied for financial problems and all I got back was that i didn't meet the criteria. Even though on the website it stated I could get some money back. In the end after about 6 months of trying I just gave up."
3,2019-05-21T00:14:36.000Z,More one on one support,"Even though this is an online course, there needs to be more telephone contact with students via student support. Assessors  are very knowledgeable but almost impossible to get through to them with questions."

Had trouble uploading the videos however and each time I asked for help with this I just ended up emailing them to student support for marking as I got no real help any other way to submit them.Work placement was hard to get in the area that I live in due to the tafe's and uni's around that already have preference on all of the places around the Perth area. The face to face interview which took 3 hours via phone was rather messy. Travis however, was so very helpful and was able to fix the bumps in the road for me. He should be commended on his patience and time skills as well as his dedication to Open Colleges."

I could not go back to previous modules as they were all locked (Module 6 was eventually unlocked so that I could see how to use the new program). There were lots of mistakes in the new material. It was a bit disappointing but at least I have managed to complete the course.The trainers/assessors were very helpful if this were not the case I probably would have given up."

1,2019-05-14T22:22:23.000Z,Biggest Waste of Time!,"Where to start! Initially, the course is for 2 years, however, if you include the fact they take 2 weeks to mark a unit then you really only get a year and a half if you don't need anything remarked. But count on resubmissions because they will request information that isn't written into the course.The course is marked on trainer discretion, I.e. if you provide a website they don't know - they won't check it they will just mark you down. For visa information I provided the Government visa website, where you apply for visas and was told I should have stated the Wikipedia website (no not joking - I only passed when I replied telling the trainer I actually apply for visas on a regular basis due to my job).The course requires around 14 voice and/or video recordings. This was not advised and realistically goes overboard - it's not a requirement in this course typically. So now not only wasting my time but 2 other people's also.The questions are often confusing and written poorly. Written in broken English, or constructed from sentences that don't make sense. I believe one example is ""lead your team to... In consultation with your team"".Then after struggling through the course content, I don't receive my certificate straight away because one grader didn't put a mark in correctly over a year ago. Where is the quality control that someones grade can be sitting as ""submission error"" for a year and a half? The only reason it's even being fixed is because I have called, several times, to find out what is happening. The first thing I get is ""you haven't finished all the work"", so clearly its not being fixed properly. The first time I called I was even advised they had amended the course and I had extra work to complete.My advice - choose a different provider because you will have submission errors, course content problems, will hardly learn anything new (if anything at all) and just waste your time with this one!"

2,2019-05-13T07:40:43.000Z,The actual course was good but‚Ä¶,"The actual course was good but uploading 25 videos whilst doing a three week placement in the hospital was so stressful    I was repeatedly told it was possible to upload the videos with the course work, because I tried to do this as instructed it crashed all my work a week into the placement   I had to pay someone to come and find the work and take the videos off and organise downsizing the videos.   I retried to upload downsized videos and once again crashed the work.    It was then recommended that I drop box the work so learnt to Dropbox everything and eventually finished all the work and submitted it and waited for it to be marked, to be told the sound was not working on a lot of the videos.   Downsizing the videos had lost the sound so couldn‚Äôt be marked.  The head of the physiotherapy department said she very much doubted she would take on another student from open colleges because there was a lot of videoing and work for her to do.      If anyone is reading this review and doing the AHA physiotherapy course put all your work on a memory stick and post it. (It takes about 10 days to get there and then 10 days to be marked) Before you post it get someone else to check it is all on the memory stick as I was told section B was not on the memory stick, (13 videos)    I was about to resend this part on another memory stick and get a friend to sign to say it was on there.    I had a phonecall at 8pm to say the work was all on the memory stick. The work then had to be resubmitted by them and I had to wait again for the work to be remarkedThe hospital was a great place to do the placement and if future students cannot get a placement there then I would not recommend this course.    I am still waiting for my certification to arrive."

Especially for the steep price we pay to get pages and pages of reading.Surely for the price we pay, having an audio or video lecture. Even if its recorded, would help add variety to the content. My preferred learning style is audio, I could listen to course content hours on hours. Sitting down to read actually disengaged me from learning and I ended up carrying out my assessments using the ""find text"" features and skim reading content.However, I did find my contact with Ronnie Clark during placement very valuable and he was very good at keeping me motivated."

Students are kept informed of what is going on in the college and alerts of short courses. Modules are well detailed and I found it easy to study in the middle of nowhere (in the field) where I don't have any professional people (in line of my studies) to help me with my studies but only rely on my own.Student Support staff are quick to respond to email request. Assessors supports students very well despite the distance and time difference. They mark assessments within the stipulated time. Study fees are very manageable.I recommend Open Colleges without any reservations to those who want to study with them.Thank you.

They promised all the help and support I would need throughout my course which the trainers and assessors were amazing. Upon the last leg of my course was an absolute disaster.. I called 30+ different organisations and emailed them and then sent follow up emails to try obtain placement. To this day I still dont have placement and will not be able to finish my course. Even Open Colleges CANNOT FIND ME PLACRMENT. I have now wasted ALOT of money as knowone will take on online students for placement. Not only were they happy to take my money no other solutions were offered but to keep paying more money to keep me enrolled in the course till placement is found which is highly unlikely ill be able to find placement.

I was so glad to have Travis as my workplace assessor. He was so knowledgeable in all aspects and made me feel very confident and comfortable throughout the WPA visit
5,2019-04-29T04:39:23.000Z,Overall experience,"Negatives:Responses to questions on open forum and via message can take too long to get back;Assessment 12 has an error in one of the form templates and one of the template guides is not included in the list of linked documents.  I notified Jim Johnson of the specifics.Feedback from assessors was in a variety of formats:1 x results form completed by assessor - was great as we can use these to show our employersMajority via direct comments in email/messaging &/or comments added to the submitted assessment.Might be nice to have consistency - if the form is to be used it should used for all responses.Assessment 12 is in a very different format to all the others and could be shortened in terms of how the instructions and case study summary is written.  It's quite confusing to follow.  It's a very time consuming and draining subject to tackle last.  It would be easier for the student to understand if it was in the same format as all the others.  I personally found it a bit of a shock and it took me lots of repeat reading and comparing between the case study information and the assessment requirement as there appeared to be conflicting information between the two.Positives:The quality of feedback is very good, especially the comments in assessments by Simon Peppercorn - very constructive and transparent on exactly what could be improved and why, as well as and what was good, why.I like the way the dashboard works and the video function saves a lot of mucking around.Very regularly, when I finished up recorded a video I would then upload the written assessment and the platform would reject it so I was submitting them via dropbox.  I only realised later that i logged out and logged back in, it worked.  Was a bit annoying & quite frustrating at the time as I didn't know what to do about it.But, overall a great platform.  I am very relieved I am finishedThanks to all the assessors for their feedback, especially Simon Peppercorn, who marked most of them."

1,2019-04-26T20:17:33.000Z,Very disappointed overall,"first of all, it would be crucial to have up-to-date content in the assessments. in 2019 we still work with old content, content referring to older versions of macOS or Windows. secondly, I was told when enrolling for this course that the student support had a free international phone number that you can call anytime if you have issues but WARNING ! it is absolutely not free especially if you're like me and study in Open colleges from overseas. I also want to mention how long it really takes to sometimes get assessment feedback, although some assessors do correct them quicker than the official timeframe given (10 days/assessment). If your goal is to study full-time in an online course with Open Colleges, DO NOT enroll, I repeat DO NOT enroll! you are wasting your time. however, if you want to study a course part-time, you can give it a try but I still wouldn't recommend it. I have much other stuff to point out, such as lack of support by the ""student support"", and not to mention the extremely slow online campus platform OpenSpace 2.0, despite my very high-speed home network (above 100mbps). they also advertise about ""study buddies"", that are sort of online classmates, it never worked despite me asking for support regarding this.  I am overall very disappointed and I wish my experience would've been better as there are some interesting courses and assessments as well. I can't list everything that's bad because it would be too long, but I do have one positive point, and that is how relatively affordable it is. if you plan on studying full time, I recommend the monthly payment option as you can save tons of money if you finish several months earlier than the given course deadline. this college has potential, however, there is a significant amount of things to be reviewed and changed in order to make the experience more pleasant for the students. I wish the future students a hopefully better experience with Open Colleges :)"

Also being aware that different mobs/tribes have very different customs and what is acceptable to one mob, may not be to another.This may also be the same for the information about the CALD community and my concern is that incorrect information is being given to students on both subject."

Although I waited almost a year after submitting my first email 2018 for an Assessor, eventually my grades were finalised in April 2019.I guess Assessors were overworked or outnumbered with considerable amount of grading students papers.However, Assessor Travis Hackett made up for it. I found Travis to be an exceptional Assessor. He knew his job well and I found him to be very helpful as well as approachable.There was one other issue that I did have and it had to do with another person who graded my work. As I worked in the field of Case Management, I provided examples in my community pertaining to the question.Unfortunately his feedback was that I was getting too emotional with my views. Again I am a professional and I stated to him, I only answered what the question provided. Those types of feedback is not what I wanted to hear. But otherwise, I redid the question and to this day, I believed the marker could have been more professional and not judgmental about my work.I was annoyed when I commenced my course that almost into it after completing several assessments, they were no longer required due to an update in the overall structure of the Open Colleges program. I get that and I understood what it was for and so I continued and eventually got over it.But in general it was a good project, I would consider telling others about Open Colleges. For me it met my needs and studying during the evenings at my pace, doing placement at my employment was really a bonus.Thank you Phyllis Sullivan"

3,2019-04-15T02:58:56.000Z,Generally a good experience.,"The course was well structured and layed out.I was moved around assessors for my last two assessments which did cause some issues.I know I took a longer than the allocated time to complete the assignments but that was due to factors beyond my control, two shoulder surgeries, running an operational business that is open 6 days a week, family issues with a high needs daughter to name just a few issues and I thank OC for their understanding.I feel my last assessor just brushed me off as he took 2 and 1/2 hours to go over my last 2 assignments and just gave me a pass.I felt I had put so much work into these they deserved better than a passing glance.The team in the on line chat were overall good to deal with as were support team via phone calls.Thanks you all for the experience, I will recommend OC to my family and Friends."
3,2019-04-15T01:18:50.000Z,my experience was quite a journey,"my experience was quite a journey, i had many dramas with my course as i was told i was one of the last to do the 11 module certificate and it changed to a 9 module. never the less through it all i had my ups and downs but overall it was not to bad. the on line coaches where better good, some new what they where talking about others didn't which was a little frustrating at times. But the came Ronnie Clark wow that guy was amazing, he went above and beyond to him me through the last stages. Honestly because of him is the reason why I finished the course. He truly is a remarkable and genuine person and I can't thank him enough. thank you open space and thank Ronnie Clark. I have forwarded another 2 people through this course hopefully they are as successful as me."

EVER!!!"

Months late still nothing. If you want to waste your time and get nothing in return then do a course with open colleges."
3,2019-04-10T23:36:42.000Z,Things I struggled with,"Received different information from different student support.Feedback from assessors was different on the same assignments.Assignments took a very long time to be marked and handed back.Deliberately sabotaged confusing questions on assignments with the hope that the assessors would send me back feedback on how to answer the questions properly.Only found a couple of assessors reliable/helpful.Some seemingly unnecessary things to cover during the workplace practical component of the certificate.I definitely wasn't much help to myself due to personal things that happened through out completing this course, but the things I have written above definitely contributed to me struggling through this course as well."

I was motivated and supported throughout my journey especially by Holly. I would definitely recommend studying with Open Colleges to everyone. They have a great payment system which was set up for me and this made it possible for me to afford this particular course. I had only ever worked in the childcare industry for most of my life, in fact about the last 17 years but with this certificate I am now able to change to a different industry and job.

Paid twice what I would at TAFE, submissions took up to 8 weeks to get marked (on average 3 weeks, some were faster, many slower), and I was required to get 100% in every test or i would have to resubmit and wait a few more weeks to get marked. Phone lines were rarely working and being 'maintained' more often than not. Two stars instead of one as the staff were polite. All staff were knowledgable and willing to help, but grossly understaffed. This review is a reflection on ownership and management."

2,2019-03-28T07:40:14.000Z,RPL refund issue,"I made initial contact with Open Colleges in January 2019 hoping to do an RPL for a Certificate 3 in Acute Care. They convinced me that I needed to submit the required documents and pay a $300 assessment fee. I was told that upon completion of the assessment, they will let me know which units I needed to do. The assessment never took place. Instead, one of their staff members called me after more than 20 business days wanting to go through an enrolment process (which required more money). I complained that I wasn't told about an enrolment before the RPL assessment. The assessment eventually did not go through because I felt that the whole process wasn't explained to me properly. They said that they would refund the $300. That was more than 7 weeks ago. Efforts to get that refund have been fruitless. I spoke to one of their staff members 10 days ago. They promised to work on processing that refund ASAP. But after multiple attempts to contact Open Colleges there has been no response. I honestly feel shortchanged by this institution."

Trainers and assessiors were supportive and accessible.I did however have issue with the profile never reflecting true progress. I found the modules were difficult to keep up with as they were modified and moved about. I think changes should be made the same time each year.The course was very thorough and interesting.

The assessments required me to go beyond the course notes. There was no spoon feeding at all and required a lot of hard work but at my own pace since it was an online course. I actively researched a lot to find the answers and in the process broadened my horizon in this field. The assessors and trainers were so helpful and understanding towards my needs.I would recommend Open Colleges to anyone who is interested in excelling in their field of interest and their future.
4,2019-03-21T20:59:58.000Z,Diploma of Leadership & Management,"I felt the course was very well structured with a well-planned flow, allowing you to apply knowledge learnt as you progressed through the modules and assessments. Coming from a background in management, I found the subject material to be relevant and applicable, and I have assimilated several aspects of the course into improving my day-to-day functions.On occasion a number of assessments contained tasks which were unclear or ambiguous in their requirements where I needed to seek clarification from the assessors. Unfortunately there is a relatively long response time (Open Space advises is up to 10 business days) which complicates your ability to smoothly progress through the course, however I was consistently pleased with the detailed and targeted feedback I received, which provided very helpful guidance and direction to research and submit accurate responses to the assessments.Overall a challenging and rewarding experience - I would certainly recommend to others, with a foreword to consider the unique aspects of online study to confirm it is suited to their individual learning requirements before commencing."

I know l made several request for the course extension but the team worked around to help me get the extensions. My work did not give me much time because l would have lost earnings if l wanted to request for study time especially the fact that a lot of mines are still tumbling economically. From the assessor l got all the feedback that pointed me in the right direction and l want thank them. I won‚Äôt hesitate to recommend anyone because l know they will manage through even if they encounter difficulties with study time.

Some of the course notes had questions that were hard to decipher and there were many grammatical errors. I would recommend that the course trainers get together and moderate the course overall to ensure students get a consistent expectation of what is requiredof them. I enjoyed it overall and the you were all very helpful. Thanks.
2,2019-03-16T06:15:45.000Z,Certificate IV Bookkeeping,"Overall I wouldn't recommend or choose to study again via Open Colleges.  I found the course material to be of average quality with a number of spelling, grammatical & other errors.  Examples & Case Study's were not well explained, often lacking the 'workings' of how an answer was arrived at.  In a Bookkeeping or Accounting Course you often need to see the workings of how a result is achieved. There were a lot of comments on the Course Material where students had identified errors in the material & they had not been corrected.  This would often represent an incorrect answer being in the study notes & without comments from previous students, would never have been identified.  I found an error in an exam that when I contacted the assessor, they confirmed the exam was wrong!  The staff / tutors were helpful when you made contact with them, however replies could take time to come back therefore leaving you unable to move forward.When I enrolled in the course I specifically enquired that the course was MAC compatible, however when I came to the using the Accounting Software (MYOB) the study notes were written for Windows & I had to do my own research on adapting the course material & exams requirements to MAC.  Some of the functionality is completely different between Windows & MAC & students had to research how to do different functions.  Study notes should be available for both Windows & MAC if the course is represented as such.A couple of the later modules had Webinars offered & that was extremely helpful as you could ask real time questions during the webinar & get accurate information from an Assessor.  A lot of the modules through the course should have had a webinar / tutorial to allow for accurate information to be supplied.Open Colleges need to go through the study notes & comments supplied by Students & fix the errors in the Course Material when it is identified."
5,2019-03-16T03:02:09.000Z,best trainers and best admin staff !,I was so impressed and grateful for the effort put into the feedback of the assesments. Resources were really good and assignments helped me gain confidence in what I need to prepare for when I start to look for a job related to the field I graduated in. The trainers were so so so kind and helpful and the open colleges staff are so helpful and graduating the students to a high standard are at their best interest.Thank you Open Colleges !
3,2019-03-16T02:42:43.000Z,Finally Made it!,"I am a single mum of 2 and it took me a fair amount of effort to get through this even though once engaged I was completely emersed and loving it! The reason being I had difficulty getting a study buddy. At first I had one but seeing as she was younger and didn't have the 'distraction' of kids, she flew right past me. I tried multiple times to gain another studdy buddy after that but to no avail.Ss are very helpful overall at assisting as much as they possibly could but many times technology or communications to trainers wasn't the best.One trainer in particular was very easy to communicate with and very flexible with her times which makes it easier to clarify assessments before commencing them. It is difficult when you are working and some tutors who will only make themselves available the few days they might be in the office.In the end I made it through and feel very fulfilled and proud of my achievement!"
5,2019-03-16T02:20:31.000Z,My experience was great!,"I had a great experience. I was one of the students who got near halfway through original diploma content then had to start over on new course when government made new standards. Initially it irritated me because I had liked the old format better, but quickly I learned that it was a great benefit as I got to develop a very solid foundation that took me from theory straight into practice.Student Support always helped when I needed, just a phone call away. The assessors were all wonderful and  I learned so much from them. My Fiji experience was life changing and something I will never forget. I loved everything from my studies.There were some hangups at times, such as quizzes that could be painful as you are required to get 100% and there were some glitches early on, but from that it helped me to learn even more so it was okay. As I progressed I did not encounter any further issues.I would highly recommend Diploma of Counselling through Open Colleges. If you are willing to learn and put energy into your development you will be well supported to go very far,"
2,2019-03-15T15:40:02.000Z,My experience with open colleges for AHA Physiotherapy,"I didn't get much support from OC except from one of the tutors, also a big turn over on tutors. The cost of the course is way over priced. Also I found that a lot of time was wasted from waiting for reply of any questions and markings of course notes. The 3 week work experience was huge far too much work like videos packed into this time frame just not practical to do at all which I didn't learn much only how to do videos. ALSO which is a joke!! You had to get 100% right every question even through it was only a cert 4 course! Doing the full Physiotherapy diploma they don't have to get everything right!! OC wouldn't give me any prior learning on this course. I HAVENT got my certificate YET due to my part of CPR for the first aid has run out so now I have to do this CPR part again before I can get the certificate but OC doesn't let you know that it was due to expire!!  I would recommend doing face to face course instead."

5,2019-03-14T20:47:55.000Z,An awesome experience of my life.,"My name is Afia. I am studying with open colleges for about 6 years now. It has been a great experience. I am here in Fiji doing my work placement. It was an awesome experience. These two weeks have been the best weeks of my life. I have enjoyed each and everyday here. I have made some amazing friends here. The group I am working with, my supervisors, my home stay people eveyone is amazing. I hope this friendship lasts for ever. I am taking with me some of the most beautiful memories of my life. Professionally I have learned so much from this project which I would have never learned from working with any one else. I have learned how to work with a group of people, leadership skills, presentation skills, how it feels sitting in a conference  room, taking blood pressures and blood sugars, one on one counselling with children, young and old people. Counselling in different environments such as schools, villages, towns, orphanages. Counselling with educated and uneducated people. The best part was coming to know about Fijian culture, getting close to people, working with diversity and much more. Fijian people are so much loving, caring, hospitable and welcoming people. If ever any one in future gets this opportunity so please grab it. It's going to be one of the best experiences of your life. I can never forget any one I have met here. I am very happy to have this family and I am going to remember them throughout my life. I am very very thankful to opencolleges for going me this opportunity. If in future I ever get a chance I will return to fiji and I will always be connected to this project for the rest of my life."

I would also recommend the Fiji work placement project. It‚Äôs a rewarding two weeks. You have to be prepared to work hard but you learn so many new skills, confidence and cultural experiences. You won‚Äôt get this opportunity again so I recommend you go. The trainers that run the program are supportive and down to earth. And it‚Äôs quite cheap for what you get out of it."

3,2019-03-08T20:13:25.000Z,Certificate 3 Individual Support Aged‚Ä¶,"Certificate 3 Individual Support Aged Care, Home and Community - underwhelming experience on multiple fronts. First this course requires a work placement in residential care which isn‚Äôt made clear until after you‚Äôve paid for the course - this placement has to be found by the student. Almost no residential facilities want students who study online, particularly in rural areas and this almost meant I couldn‚Äôt complete course. Links in course notes regularly did not work or were out of date, notes were repetitive and long winded and didn‚Äôt always cover what was in assessments. For rural students no assessor comes to your work placement which is a joke as assessment is done by phone but they didn‚Äôt get round to phone call until 2 months after I had done work placement. Open Colleges Computer system for online study is not suitable for apple computers or iPad so assignments didn‚Äôt download adequately and lost formatting when uploading.This was a nightmare.  Student support did not have solutions to this issue and would say they‚Äôd get back to you but never did.  Some course material was awful, the cultural diversity section was eye wateringly bad and had clearly not been written by someone educated in this area."

3,2019-03-06T19:24:47.000Z,Individual Support Cert III,"I probably wouldn't go through this again any time soon. The course was a lot of work, for what it was, with not much support. It was hard to get in touch with assessors and any communication would take a long time. The assignments weren't very clear on what was expected, with questions not worded clearly and a satisfactory mark dependent on who was marking it. The course would suit a dole bludger with plenty of time on their hands, but I expect that type of person would have less patince than I, and thus probably not do to well in the caring industry. But I shouldn't make assumptions. I digress. I would have liked a better standard, given what I paid and the time I put in. But hey, I got a certificate out of it."
1,2019-03-06T08:27:09.000Z,I honestly wish i didn't undertake‚Ä¶,"I honestly wish i didn't undertake studies with Open Colleges , i was drawn to them due to they were online and that it was flexible with working full time. I have previously undertaken study twice before this and this was defiantly the worst i have experienced ever. Luckily i was only completing a Certificate IV, i would hate to think how frustrated people may be undertaking above this. When you make first contact with Open Colleges all seems well , after you inquire they will call you non-stop like telemarketers until they can sign you up. The next stage of the process of when you start your course just appears to go down hill from here. Some assessors not all, are very slack and they're obviously understaffed with massive workloads,expect to wait and wait and wait for your assessments to eventually get marked. The main concern i had with them was the online portal which has never ending technical difficulties this consists on students who are left feeling very frustrated and having to redo quiz's or other assessments multiple times until you give up and have to call the office to get assistance. The student support and the office will just tell you the same thing each time and that they are looking into this. Unfortunately this appears to keep recurring. The assessments are very poorly written and in some cases you will find yourself reading over the same question multiple times. Overall i would not recommend anyone to undertake studies with this place and to do your research in other RTO's or higher education if you can. If your course consists of you undertaking a student placement and you are relying on your course to get you a step into an industry i would not recommend them, this process is a long waiting game to even start the student process and once you have expect zero support. They will call you and your manager to make contact and appear to be professional but then for 120 hours of student placement i had zero contact until the end of my placement their response when i spoke to someone regarding this was you can call us if you are having issues!! Luckily i was already working in the industry of my study. I  could help think about if someone was undertaking this placement and didn't have prior experience on how they would feel with zero support and guidance. So overall i would say if i could go back ...... DON'T DO IT !!!!!!"
1,2019-03-06T07:08:38.000Z,find a different online study organization,"I do not recommend them.The only time they reach out to you is for their money, they don't care about your academic success, you get ignored despite chasing multiple trainers for help, their open space is always glitched, the work placement assessment is a joke.. they set up a date for my wpa and then did a no show with no phone call. If it wasn't for the other students doing the same course in a Facebook group, I wouldn't have made it through. This company is an absolute JOKE and i cannot believe they're still allowed to run. I've studied online before with other companies who actually call you and see how you are going in your course, open colleges would never do that. They're about business, that's it. I paid 6.4k for my diploma and felt so alone, and have also just discovered my diploma isn't even nationally recognized with a lot of places. A waste of my time and money."
4,2019-03-06T05:09:51.000Z,Some of the modules had outdated links‚Ä¶,"Some of the modules had outdated links for the practise exercises and there is too much 'role play' for the assessments.  I understand that you need an audio to establish that students are getting critique/feedback, but role plays are not necessary.  Admittedly, I am 44 and I don't not want to do a role play for an assessment.Otherwise I liked a lot of the exercises and I enjoy learning.  Perhaps I should have enrolled in Graphic Design rather than Digital Design."

I called and emailed more then twice and was stuffed around.On the 4th call to them to ask them what was going on (this is 3 weeks of not receiving my 3rd SP) they tell me it can‚Äôt be accessed until I find work placement. So not only are they withdrawing money from my account for me to not have any study material, they also could‚Äôve told me that when I called the first time. Instead, they dragged it out. The cooling of period is only 5 days once you enroll, by which I hadn‚Äôt even received any study material to decide whether or not I want to proceed.A waste of money and just a painful experience."
1,2019-02-27T06:44:54.000Z,disappointing experience considering the huge financial outlay,The course relied on outdated and irrelevant youtube videos and web articles and very little content that was created by the college. The college's meagre content was riddled with spelling and grammar errors and was very amateurish and often nonsensical. The majority of the tutors were disinterested and not at all supportive yet always willing to blow their own horns about their personal abilities. They seem to think that ten business days is acceptable to reply to emails or mark assignments. Overall the experience was disappointing and not one I would repeat.

I needed to start again. This must have been known when I enrolled and yet I wasn't informed. The new course, however, was better organised (though the material still has typos) but it wasn't until I finally had conversations with my assessor for my placement check points it all came together. I'd like to thank Maryanne Roland for her encouragement and support in our check point interviews.  Interaction with Maryanne raised my star rating from 3 to 4."

Planning, inspiration, composition, lighting, fairly advanced editing in Lightroom and Photoshop, networking and all aspects of the business of being a photographer are covered. The assessments are not easy and often require a second attempt to get what the assessor is looking for as they are worded a bit ambiguously sometimes. That usually means you have to dig deeper and that isn't a bad thing.The admin side of things all worked smoothly."

2,2019-02-18T09:37:11.000Z,Great trainers and assessors but poor customer service.,"I find the trainers and assessors knowledgeable and competitive.However, customer service officers are inconsistent, inefficient and sometimes rude. Everytime i  call customer service the last few months, i got a runaround and if I did not tell them i wanted to make a complaint, i wouldnt have graduated until now.One customer service officer (Lexie) even raised her voice at me when I advised of my disappointment and frustration about not getting the right response. She also provided me with incorrect information about the timezone for the assessor checkpoint (told me it was sydney time), i almost missed my appointment. Thats unacceptable and because of that interaction with customer service officers I wouldnt want any of my friends or anyone i know to experience the same treatment while studying."

They were awesome to me when i needed an extension as i need more time due to personal tragedies in my life x 2 and unfortunately was not confident enough to trust myself that i could complete this course.  I have proved to myself that i can do anything i put my mind too.  Thank you open colleges!"
3,2019-02-16T01:54:35.000Z,Overall my experience as ok,"Overall my experience as ok.I was disappointed that although I was to have three communications with my trainer during workplacement, I had NONE. I appreciate that Sanet was ill but the College should have referred my situation to another trainer. This was an obvious breach of the workplace placement arrangement and created a very poor impression with my workplace supervisor.The consequence of this failing by the College was that it took me several attempts to complete the first assignment relating to workplacement, and that only after a phone all.At one point I asked the trainer for a point of clarifcation in the process of the workplacement assignments. Her reply was ‚Äùif you read the ...‚Äù I found this condescending and insulting.The criteria against which assignments were marked has two roles, one to be the benchmark for assessment the second is to be instructive. I did not find the criteria sufficiently specific to be instructive.Often feedback from the trainers was too brief and where there were shortcomings did not identify the specific area to be addressed eg Activity 2 section 4 needs......I appreciate the trainers cannot be interrupted on ad hoc basis but when times are set by the trainer they must be kept. As an example, I had a time set for 1000 and the trainer did not ring, Ifollowed up told she would ring back, she did hours later when I had gone had to work. Another time she rang back an hour past with the excuse she had been in a meeting, a message could have saved me sitting around idle waiting!!I am impressed with the speed with which the course was finalised and certificate sent out, well done."

However the course content was often not updated to reflect the correct unit or topic number. It often made it difficult to find the learning material or to understand the assignment requirements.I noticed several times other students had posted their feedback more then 12 mths earlier about the same issue I had identified and it had still not been updated.Overall I would study with open colleges again

For a dual certificate not enough time is allowed as you get the same timeframe for one certificate. Overall support was tardy in responding to queries. And lastly some assessors feedback was not descriptive enough as opposed to others that were brilliant. My overall learning experience was good and I thank open colleges. These things are mentioned as constructive criticism.
2,2019-02-11T23:31:24.000Z,Wouldn‚Äôt do it again,"Found it annoying having to wait for markers to mark assignments until we could move on to next module. At one stage I waited nearly 3 weeks. I didn‚Äôt like how we had to have every single answer correct on an assignment, having to resubmit until everything was correct and waiting for the markers again. Way too much paperwork for work placement, this should be summarised especially the parts supervisors have to sign. I found students who went through TAFE had a much easier experience completing their course."

4,2019-02-10T08:16:34.000Z,"Good, but needs tweaking","Overall, it was a good experience, however I found some of the material to have poor grammar and punctuation. Another very exasperating experience was one quiz question which really only had two responses - the response was appropriate, or the response was not appropriate. This particular question had another option - a fullstop in front of the response was appropriatev and this ridiculous option was the correct answer. With this and some other poorly worded answers, it felt like the college wants people to fail. I can't imagine how difficult it would be for English as Second Language students!Further, I sent couple of emails through about some of these very strange answers and no one ever replied to me, which I think is rather rude.So, please, have someone go through your courses, check then using spell check, and check that all answer options actually make sense."
3,2019-02-09T23:38:26.000Z,I would not complete further studies,"I would not complete further studies through Open Colleges. Throughout my studies I contacted a few different trainers to ask for clarification on the assessments. Each time they responded they simply copied and pasted the assessment question. This did not answer my query and was not helpful at all. I simply had to muddle through myself. Thankfully I was on the right track and was able to obtain a HD or a D. I also found that most of the assessment questions were not worded clearly hence why I had to ask for clarification from my trainers. I felt that the assessments could have been cleared and from reading the messages boards, for every single module, other students felt the same. The message boards went back at least 12 months with the same queries which were never fixed in the assessments. The learning materials themselves were acceptable, it was the assessments and trainers that left something to be desired. I planned to complete further studies but after this experience I will not be back."

Open Learning's patience in allowing me the extra time to finish this course was extremely generous and of course a huge help to me.It has been an experience of great benefit and of course I would recommend Open Colleges to any person considering upgrading their skills or acquiring new ones."

You email your trainer/assessor and wait up to sometimes a couple of days to get a response.  In saying that, every trainer/assessor I had was very helpful and it IS a correspondence course so that is the nature of the beast.  All feedback given to me was very constructive and informative. I think everyone needs to remember that the trainers are busy too and get back to the students as quickly as they can. Overall happy with the experience - I graduated! - and will look to study again in a few years.

I only had one module not save my correct answers. When I asked my assessor his reply was that I had to do it all again. The others were ok. It was what you would expect from an online course. Very hard to talk to someone over email.

I found the assessors to be very responsive and encouraging, always marking assignments within a couple of days and offering feedback.In terms of the course content, some of the links provided were fairly old and others broken. I assume they were not updated as the course is coming to an end, but it was still a shame. The student forum was also a bit of a ghost-town, but I don't feel this had a major impact on my studies. My main complaint about OpenSpace (the online learning environment) is that it doesn't notify you when an assignment has been marked, so I had to just keep checking back.Some of the assignments were quite painful (I can't tell you how many times I answered a question about ergonomics), but overall the course did teach me a lot about writing and editing, and it was great to get feedback from assessors who have real-world experience in the industry."

During this time I had an unexpected personal matter arise which didn't allow me to study for a period of months.Open colleges staff were very supportive helping me with extensions and always helpful with questions that I had and happy to help in any way they could. I would recommend open colleges to study as sometimes study online can be challenging but with the support open colleges provide it makes it all the more achievable.

Meanwhile, the student waits for a reply that never comes.Students should be made aware that at the end of a course, if they needed a First Aid Certificate to qualify, that First Aid Cert must be current.  If it has run out during the course, then it must be refreshed/renewed or NO certificate, diploma etc.  A heads up would've been nice instead of having to wait a few more weeks."

Found it awesome to be able to complete the course in my own time.Only thing that i found different from being in class to doing the course online is that emailing the teachers of any questions you may have and waiting about a day or two to get a response which is totally fine since its an online course.Overall Teachers were nice and very helpful.One thing for the online content though is that some of the links to external sites were broken/moved/removed/or not found they will need to be checked and updated every now and then though a quick google search and i was able to find the answers.
1,2019-01-17T06:36:38.000Z,Open Colleges wasn't a good experience‚Ä¶,"Open Colleges wasn't a good experience for me, not only was the course material badly written with multiple typos, some of the assessment questions were unclear and needed much more detail on what was needed to be completed.I had alot of trouble finding placement even after calling and also applying online at every singe possible place in Melbourne Victoria, after being allocated placement by student support i then had to wait 2 months to complete it and once started it took me 3 hours everyday to drive there. Whilst at placement we are given a student portfolio to complete, the pages are all over the place making it hard to keep organised and trying to edit scanned documents to get signed and add in assessments was extremely difficult which almost left me unable to be graded multiple times.I felt extremely frustrated with how this course went for me, and after talking to open colleges today i am now unable to be graded or receive my certificate because my first aid has expired which wouldn't have expired if this course didn't take so long to complete and student support and my teacher didnt take so long to get back to me, i could wait 2 week at a time to hear back from support. overall i am very unhappy with my experience and the setbacks i had."

2,2019-01-16T04:58:32.000Z,Never again,"Not only are students not notified that there is more theoretical work involved in the work placement assessment process (due to us not having access to to that section of open space until all other sections are complete) but it was tedious and unnecessary.The whole process of using imaginary patients to demonstrate your proficiency in in performing a skill was redundant when we had already competed these skills within a hospital setting with real patients under the supervision of the hospital employees.The assessment could have been much more streamlined if Open Colleges had trusted the organisation that was housing their students, and their students, rather than being more concerned with themselves being sued."
5,2019-01-15T05:33:02.000Z,I would highly recommend Open Colleges,Studying through Open Colleges was the best choice I made!! They are there to support and help you graduate to the best of your ability. I always felt I could ask and talk to the support line about anything and that no matter what they would work with me to finish my course in time. The topics in my course were full of detail information that was relavent and clear to understand. The assessments where also well set out so I knew what was expected of me and if needed I was given a chance to fix or add to help get the best mark I could. I would recommend studying through Open Colleges to everyone as it accommodates all study types and allows you to work your study within your life.
3,2019-01-14T04:05:51.000Z,Overall happy but the assessments need to be reviewed.,"Overall I am happy with what I have taken away from my course with Open Colleges - Certificate IV Photography and Photo Imaging. I gained valuable knowledge on how to conduct myself as a professional and take my hobby and turn it into a business.I did, however, have major issues with the completing the assessments. The main problem that carried across almost every assessment was the confusing way in which they were worded.  The level of ambiguity and repetition caused an incredible amount of time wasting and frustration when trying to get clarification from the trainers or just attempting to decode the questions myself. This seems to be a problem that many other people who took this course struggled with also, almost every day I would see people asking questions for clarification or outright expressing their frustrations on the Facebook group or OpenSpace. I seriously believe that all the assessments for this course need to be looked at and possibly rewritten to make it easier for those working on them to understand what is being asked of them and to streamline the course as a whole."

2,2019-01-12T00:13:24.000Z,Would not recommend,"Very expensive for what it is. I only chose Open Colleges so I could study online, but now I wish I just did night school instead. Assignments reword questions to make the word counts higher, so half of what you‚Äôre writing is totally redundant and a waste of time. A lot of the links in the content are expired, so I guess they haven‚Äôt been updated in awhile. When I was on my placement I needed some support but none of the staff responded to my questions so I was on my own to figure things out. They also needed to do checkpoints throughout the work placement to pass me, but would never call me at the times that were arranged. Overall a negative experience of me having to chase everything up myself and not being provided with the appropriate support. Would highly recommend going to your local TAFE instead. Staff were nice enough but it was just super hard to get in contact with them. Open Colleges should hire more staff so they aren‚Äôt spread so thin."

3,2019-01-03T08:47:27.000Z,Up and down,"In my experience the Cert IV in Allied Health Assistance (Physiotherapy) was ok. The theory portion of the course was good but I feel that more was needed in terms of exploring mobility equipment, the what, how and why. Also there was a lot of content regarding diversity, laws, policies and procedures which I found terribly dry and mundane. Anatomy and Physiology content could be explored in greater detail also. Working with the human body is complex even if one is working under the direction of an AHP, I believe an AHA needs to be well studied in human biology. Overall the theory portion was good. Assessments were structured well and format for feedback of assessments were great.The work placement portion of this Certificate was very overwhelming at times. The book work required in the 120 hours of placement is not balanced. When completing ones work placement hours in either a hospital or aged care facility, attempting to complete both written work and filming 20 videos whilst also trying to learn as much as possible from your AHP supervisor, the work load is unrealistic. Also finding the time to sit down with your supervisor to discuss all aspects of the book work and videos is also unrealistic. Time is, unfortunately in this day and age, of the essence. There needs to be changes made to the work placement structure. There are too many videos that are required. Plus, uploading these videos to the Open Space portal took a very long time - I spent more than 8 hours attempting to upload Section B videos (and I'm not computer illiterate). The positive out of the placement aspect of this course is that I had the support of an absolutely amazing assessor!!! She was extremely supportive, gave great feedback and I felt I could openly communicate with her at any stage. Her support and encouragement was unwavering. So to her a massive thank-you :)Overall, a lot of changes that could be and should be made to this course. But I'm happy I have completed it and am working as an AHA in a great facility, I feel like I'm making a real difference in people's lives now."

Inability to get information or help within a reasonable amount of time.Poor communication from college, apart from the initial contact that I instigated to the college for a follow up within the first three months.  (where I was given incorrect information) I actually never received contact outside of marking or by my request in the 42 months that I took to complete the course.  The advised time to study and complete this course is impossible unless you have no life, and the information given gives you a false sense of timing in which to complete the course."

Throughout the course, they gave indirect answers and poor feedback. It is very much a self taught course. There were many times where I needed more details and information to complete assessments.

Student Support where a great help when I needed them, and the Trainers and Assessors were great also. The only negative I have to report is the lack of assistance I had with my community placement. I completed 110 hours in a residential setting and all of that went smoothly, however I had a lot of difficulty in securing a placement for the last 10 hours in the community. I asked Open Colleges for some assistance with this and they were more than happy to assist me, however the forms that I had to complete were quite cumbersome, and at the time I was already feeling very overwhelmed because I was so close to completing my course yet I was having so much difficulty with this last step. I am happy to report that I was able to secure a placement in the community on my own and completed my course.üòÅ I definitely would recommend Open Colleges and in fact I am already considering my next course with them."

Links are to other peoples YouTube videos, (but are slowly building their own training videos). Sometimes it is difficult to understand what is required.

The wording on these tasks were not clear and there were lots of spelling and punctuation errors which made it difficult. In addition, one assessment in partthad huge errors throughout, changing the case studies client from a she to a He and putting in a random name in the question.I found it really poor that other students had identified that the assessments were not clear months before I attempted the assessment and though the trainer said they would tell management, I found the same errors hasn‚Äôt been fixed 6mo this later. I also thought that communication from trainers could be improved. I really struggled when first doing this course and found that after 4 months, hadn‚Äôt complete one assessment, but also never had anyone contact me to ask if I was going okay. That would be something that could be changed in the future."

However, if you do get stuck at all, fellow students are very kind and helpful, the trainers are extremely friendly and dedicated to helping and encouraging you, and student support is the best professional support network I have ever come across.

Everything has been designed to help navigate through every study period, the modules are very detailed and with practical scenarios, the trainers and the student support team are always ready to assist with any challenge...My assessor Ean Joyce was so amazing! I learnt a great deal from his comments and corrections because he always reviewed my assessment word for word, pointing what could have been added and still suggesting material for clearer and additional knowledge, aside that, he will always send you feedbacks right on time. He was such an inspiration!"

4,2018-12-07T23:14:54.000Z,I was very nervous to begin a course‚Ä¶,"I was very nervous to begin a course again after a few years of only working and not studying.. so I liked the fact that with open college I was able to do my studies online in the comfort of my home at my own pace. The study materials where very helpful with a decent amount of information that I required. I found it difficult to adapt with the feedback method of waiting upto 10 days, somtimes it just felt like a long process when waiting for a question to be answered or just to get feedback. Sometimes when I asked a question to the support trainer, there either wasn't an answer or it would be many days later with a response that didn't relate to my question.I had a work placement with my course, which was perfectly fine, but I wish I was notified when enrolling that I would have to do my placement in a different state, as I'm sure open college would have been aware that Perth did not have anything available for me to do a placement, just having more preparation would have been nice, as this was all out of my own expense and all I wanted was to complete my course, which could have been impossible if I was unable to go to a different state, which would have been a shame with all those months spent studying. But in saying that, the support I received when i needed help with a placement was amazing! The support officer who helped me went above and beyond with sorting a placement in the time frame that was available for me, which I really appreciated. I had an amazing work placement experience which I am grateful for! I learnt so much and this all wasn't as scary as I thought it would have been,  so in saying that I'm glad I took the risk to study online and to do my course with open college, it was defiantly a positive experience where I have learnt so much."

Open Colleges platform was easy to use and was very comfortable, Student Support staff have been very supportive and helpful. The courses were very practical, useful and knowledgeable and I have learned a lot. I am a bit disapointed from one of the assessors (Angie Kasper). The other assessors were very professional. Thanks to their guidance and support, it made my studying much easier. I would recommend Open Colleges to anyone!"

3,2018-12-04T03:42:10.000Z,Placement problems,"I had no problems with Open Colleges right through the course until I got to the practical component. I struggled to find a placement, contacting over 50 speech pathologists in the Perth metro area. When attempting to get help from student support I was told to 'keep trying'. Someone eventually helped me by contacting a hospital on my behalf, however when I was CC'd into the enquiry email it was basically what I had been sending out myself. At this point I couldn't be bothered completing the course. I eventually found a placement myself which was over an hour's drive away from where I live.When I had finished my placement I submitted my work for marking. I heard nothing back so contacted the assessor who told me they had not received anything back from my work placement. Surely you are able to follow this up yourself if you have sent the paperwork? I had to follow up with my placement and re-send them the questions they had to complete. I also had to apply for an extension at this stage because of the lack of follow up from the assessor.When I eventually got all my paperwork in and was waiting on confirmation that I had completed the course, I received an email to say I wouldn't be sent my certificate until I re-sat my Provide CPR as it was now out of date. I have no problem with re-sitting my CPR as I was due to do this for my workplace, the problem as I saw it was that when I submitted my certificates for credit transfer, maybe it should be compulsory that the CPR cannot be a credit transfer and must be a new certificate as you have to renew this every 12 months."
2,2018-12-03T01:09:17.000Z,Diploma of Accounting not recommended through Open Colleges.,"I would definitely not recommend the Diploma of Accounting through Open Colleges. Tax material was out of date and assessment questions are very ambiguous. Very little support was offered and the grading and assessment feedback was not consistent. I did, however, receive free extensions after complaining. The support team that handled complaints and enquiries were very helpful. Glad the experience is over! I will not ever be studying through Open Colleges again."
3,2018-12-02T23:41:11.000Z,Could be better.,"Good breath of subjects in course content to meet industry requirements, however inadequate learning support. Need to rely heavily on self learning and motivation. Trainer feedback is only offered upon completion of each assessment...no follow up to check on progress or opportunity for discussion of topics with trainers during course work.Lag time for responses to online questions/queries are variable...usually within 24 hrs (depending on trainer/workloads) but sometimes more than 1-2 days. Would have been much better if you could physically call to speak to a trainer or book an appointment."

5,2018-11-30T23:34:28.000Z,Tops From Enrolment Onwards!,From the enrolment stage on the phone I had an officer who was polite and explained all information clearly making enrolment simple. During the online orientation of my space everything was clear and simple to understand which was handy when I began studying. The only matter was that some links to research/read were broken but it's great to see this issue has been resolved. Open Colleges is great and the Open Colleges online team do their best to assist you I learnt to be patient.

3,2018-11-29T22:58:45.000Z,Significant Time Commitment Required,"I studied a Diploma in Graphic Design through Open Colleges. Speaking to one of their enrollment team when I was inquiring about the course, I was advised that the course would require at least 20hr a week time commitment. Through the duration of my studies I found 20hr /week time commitment a gross under estimation of the time for reading the course material and completing the assignments. I complained about this under estimation of study time on a number of occasion and note that the recommended time commitment has been increased to 30hr /week which is more realistic.Generally I found student support helpful and the assessors accessible and attentive. I suggest more effective assistance might be provided to students if there is an option for them to book in appointments to speak to the assessors about any assignment difficulties that they may be experiencing.This course has an affiliated facebook group. I found about about this through a fellow student, not through the course assessors or student support. Access to this group was absolutely invaluble throughout my studies. Having access to other students studying the same course definitely added value to the manner in which I approached assignments and made it possible to complete the course requirements. Without access to the other students, completing this course would have been more stressful and less achievable.The course material was below the required standard, particularly given this is a study by correspondence course. Often links to relevant articles and web pages did not work. We were directed to read the same specific course material multiple times. Occasionally I found the assessment quiz at the end of a module was incorrectly allocated making it almost impossible for the student achieve the required pass grade for the quiz.Assignments were generally manageable however more care should be applied to the wording of the questions as I often found them long winded and occasionally didn't make sense.At the time when I sought to commit to studying whilst continuing to work full time, this was one of the only Graphic Design courses that accommodated my needs and for that reason I would recommend it to others. However in my experience, people considering doing this course need to be aware of the significant time commitment required and therefore personal sacrifices that come with electing to sign up for this course."
1,2018-11-29T23:02:37.000Z,Terrible!  would give Zero stars if I Could,"The course changed half way through, I got no support at all through this change even though I'd wasted a year and a lot of hard work, in fact at that time to support staff were incredibly rude and intolerant.  Then the course changed - there are no longer grades such as distinction etc so there's no motivation to go beyond the basic and the basic is VERY basic, the questions can be answered with google, its such a dumbed down course, some of the materials supplied are in themselves plagiarised from other sources (I will be complaining to the ombudsman), and others are offensive because they are so patronising, one of the videos about child development were just a bunch of parents talking about their kids, they had no qualifications at all, they are all American videos taken from a course over there because they keep referring to work they've already done (which we haven't) and that they'll see us all on Tuesday, which they won't. The quality of the videos was also cringe-worthy in some cases, inaudible and rambling. and almost containing some kind of advertising.   Additionally the modules are wildly different in the effort and time they require  (eg 5.2 being half of 5.3) so you never know how far you have to go.  I also believe this is deliberate because of course they get more money if you need an extension.  I have wasted weeks and weeks of leave and precious time with my family unable to progress because my work took so long to mark and the next module was not opened up for me.  The links rarely work correctly or they link to incorrect or insufficient areas such as in 5.3.2 and my questions nearly always went unanswered,  Some of the trainers seemed to try their best and I can imagine they also got no support.  The course was painful, inefficient, basic and terrible quality from start to finish. These other reviews must have been posted by ‚Äòinterested parties ‚Äò and when they refer to it being easy that‚Äôs ridiculous we are supposed to be learning it shouldn‚Äôt be easy - anyone can google answers - also my work experience supervisor at the council said she would never take anyone from our course again because of the awful procedures - additionally most of the questions were seemingly written by people who‚Äôs mother tongue is obviously not English, they were almost impossible to decider - by the way I got all distinctions before they changed the grading system so I am not writing this because I failed!!"

3,2018-11-26T04:22:33.000Z,Acceptable,"AcceptableWhilst I was able to graduate from my course there were issues that need to be addressed.  For the majority my assessors were great when I did request assistance and went the extra mile, however one of my assessors did not seem familiar with the assessment piece and gave feedback that directly contradicted the assessment instructions.  He made this assessment (which stated that as a bookkeeper we were filling in for a PA which makes the task completely irrelevant to the course) such a drawn out process.  There was also outdated learning materials, incorrect examples and very ambiguous (by the assessor's own admittance) assessment instructions.If you are not extremely self motivated  or haven't worked in this industry before, I would not recommend this course for you."
2,2018-11-25T23:41:34.000Z,Workload,"Too much work for a certificate 3 in early education and care! i work in a daycare centre and my boss stated that i was doing the workload of diploma status. she also told me that i could have had a pay rise after completing 3/4 of my modules, by open colleges does not allow this, which is very unfair if you need assistance with welfare.The support from the OC staff could have been more clear as well and they could have been more available. it was not until they started noticing my complaints that i began to receive support faster.Apart from that, I did get through the course and completed my certificate 3, but my experience was sadly not a positive one."
3,2018-11-25T22:50:31.000Z,I got through but felt frustrated at times,"I got through the course ok but felt very frustrated at times. For a completely online course it could have been better. My reasons are as follows:- The course notes were hard to follow. If you needed to refer to something again you often had to trawl through each page to find it. It would be great if there was a search function for each page. Or even subheadings in the menu.- The portal was very slow. I would have to log out and in again to receive an email in my inbox.- The large staff turnover made it difficult to work out who could help with my queries.- A lot of the assessments were poorly laid out. Some not in order of the steps which made it difficult when you had to follow step-by-step. The formatting could be improved as well, especially when you had to fill in a table. The fonts weren‚Äôt even the same.- You should tell people who are using Apple Mac‚Äôs that the MYOB version they have to use is old. I was using a Mac when I started and had to switch to a PC because the version was too old and needed to use the newer version as that‚Äôs what I use at work.- The 10 day assessment marking is far too long. Luckily it only came in for my last assessment but that meant with changes it took almost a month to finish."

Having studied online before and on campus they offer great learning tools.The fact that its self paced is great, they are also very understanding when it comes to having extensions for your course.All the trainers give you great responses on how to improve yourself and your work and the support they give you is great! they really care about your progress and want you to suceed."
2,2018-11-25T09:20:54.000Z,The trainers are very helpful but the‚Ä¶,The trainers are very helpful but the learning material is very minimal and you basically have to teach the whole course to yourself. You are only given one text book and basically have the internet to learn the whole course. The questions within the workplace portfolio are not worded appropriately for the amount of work required for a satisfactory grading. This really needs to be upgraded and improved for a better understanding for the students and the amount of work and detail required for the assessment. This also drags the workload out for the student and prolongs the time required to finish this course. I think the staff would benefit a lot more if the students work equipment was a lot more clear.

Travis Hackett , Rosan Lal and Livingston was what kept me on track to finish my course and  I believe without itI may have given it up. I so looked forward to opening those little comment boxes in my marked assessments and being affirmed that I was on the right track and all my work and research was not in vain.Thank you .

I found it a little difficult to find my 10 hrs Community work placement even though I had contacts in the industry as most of them said ‚Äòthere‚Äôs a lot of paperwork for just 10 hrs‚Äô. I eventually found somewhere that would take me for the 10 hours so don‚Äôt give up if it gets a bit hard"

1,2018-11-22T02:39:00.000Z,STAY AWAY FROM OC.,"As a student, I felt the assessors were very inconsistent (eg always spoke to someone new, had to explain everything over and over again) received different feedback for the same questions, a lot of the online quizzes have grammar mistakes and too many open ended questions that leave us students guessing. The structure since I first enrolled has changed several times, I assume for the better. I have had to put through an official complaint regarding the assessors, and as I guess I am not the only student feeling this way, I have noticed that about 5-10 assessors have since left OC, there was no explanation or statement regarding this either.Course material is incomplete - I completed a Veterinary Nursing Certificate, and we learnt NO anatomy if you can believe it.There's no ongoing support from OC.. they don't email or call you to see how you are going for example if you have been inactive for a while.I have finally graduated, and even then I had to make sure that they spelled by name correctly on my certificate.If you are a strong independent person that doesn't need to be motivated, can do a lot of online research, has previously been to uni and has done reports, research papers, knows how to reference, and have already secured placement, then this is the course for you! Otherwise stay clear!!"

Still annoyed that the original document for my First Aid course wan't considered proof positive that I had completed the course.I thought insufficient weight given to practical application of cognitive behavioural therapy and practical awareness of alcoholic/addictive thought patters such as black and white thinking, personalising, rationalising, denying, and so on.Some basic spelling error, text appearing twice and poor editing in course material but generally a good course."

This is my second time studying online, having previously studied with Open University, and it was far and away the best.Despite a couple of health struggles delaying my progress, with the support of the Open Colleges team I've completed my course and am now beginning my job hunt as a Teachers Aide. The team at Open Space really made me feel like they cared about me as a person, even going so far as to walk me through a couple of calming breathing exercises when I called in the middle of a full blown panic attack.The material on Open Space (Open Colleges' online studying portal) is clear and easily understood and the course modules followed a logical pattern that built on each other, allowing me to build on my knowledge as I studied. There was never a time I felt lost.Thanks for helping me find my awesome, Open Colleges."

This was a money can't buy experience that i was so grateful to be apart of.

If you put in the hard work you will get out what you want and to move forward.  The chance to gain extra curriculum and understand by studying in the privacy of your own home and having a buddy system in place on hand where you can ask questions to fellow students doing same course!

4,2018-11-19T05:31:13.000Z,Isolating,The assessors and trainers were extremely helpful but online study was isolating and drawn out. The assessment wasn‚Äôt written well in order for easy comprehension and steps on how to complete the tasks. Some of the assessment didn‚Äôt relate to the course material  so assessor was needed to clarify what was required .
2,2018-11-18T23:07:14.000Z,Poor experience,I had a rather poor experience with Open Colleges. This was primarily due to the delays in waiting for assignments to be marked. At times this wait lasted for 3 months. It took a lot of hassling to finally get my assignments marked. I also found a lot of the external links in the provided content to be out of date and not working. This was not helpful.

All trainers gave great feedback and the webinars are super helpful.I would only say that the course material can sometimes have places where it lacked, links not working etc, but I think that has been improved even since I was completing the early stages (I noticed when i went back to research a part of the last assessment) so it would seem your constantly onto that too.All in all a great experience, thank you."
4,2018-11-16T05:00:39.000Z,Good experience,Open Colleges were easy to deal with in my experience and any time I needed assistance I received it. The work placement in Fiji was an amazing experience and made it so much easier for me to complete my hours.

The assessments also say they need at least a 50% to pass, but I got one point from an ‚Äúout of 5‚Äù question wrong and the whole assessment was withheld. Also, when asking where to find the answer to a question in the assessment, the assessor point you to a part of the workbook that has absolutely nothing to do with the topic you‚Äôre doing. The work placement section needs to be more obvious too. I was almost finished the theory assessments when I saw that it wouldn‚Äôt complete the course. I had to search the website finding out what I had to do, and in a small tab, there‚Äôs a work placement part and there were seven more assessments I had to do in short amount of time."

There is little to no original content in this course. I made a formal complaint and asked for a refund of the payments I have already made, and that was declined, but I was also told I now have to pay for the remainder of the course in full. I am on a payment plan with Open Colleges because I couldn't afford to pay for the course up front and yet I am now supposed to come up with the money to pay for a product I do not want or need. Absolutely disgusted with the way this organisation has set up it's policies to be basically anti student. My university was far more accommodating to change of mind and direction. I deeply regret enrolling with Open Colleges. Currently awaiting the next degrading response to my last email explaining how upset I am as someone with no savings and working as a casual in retail post uni. Don't study through these crooks, go to a real university instead."

There was little support from Open Colleges when I ran into problems trying to gain and complete work experience, nor when I ran into any other problems. The information on the modules was often outdated, and most of the assignments required extensive additional research to complete.

I understand the amount of student requesting assistance but I paid for course and I expected help when I required it. I had a piece of work marked unsatisfactory ,that was not even mine and I had a student support member undermine me and try to tell me that the work was in fact mine and that I needed to redo the work in order to be marked  this continued until my assessor did confirm the work was in fact not mine, to which she profusely apologised for and the work was regraded.  In regards to assessments I had to follow up 2/3 times on work that took longer than the advertised time to be marked, many of times the feedback that was provided offered relevant information however a few trainers provided useless information that couldn‚Äôt be use to fix or improve assessments.Overall I had a mediocre experience and I would not use or recommend Open Collages"

Tracey and Jim (trainers) are second to none in my book.Congratulations to these guys, and keep up the good work for those students lucky enough to have you mentor them.kind regards,Mark LouisRegister Architectp.s.

However it became very confusing during the change over. It was impossible to get a straight answer out of any one and pointless trying to ring anyone because you would be on hold for 2 hours and then be disconnected. I am very happy I was able to finish the course without having to do the GAP assessments but I can imagine that would have been incredibly troublesome for people.
3,2018-11-04T05:41:16.000Z,Improve access to course info,The course could improve by:Having all links and sites updated.Not be as repetitive in having an overview as well as content which overlap unnecessarily.Having an index or reference system so you can look up things with ease rather than go through the module.

I realised after starting that I wasn't happy with the lack of information and the super high expectations from OC.

I called up to check and they say that is all I enrolled in. That is not true and I am very disappointed in you guys. I have the first for modules to prove it and they said I didn‚Äôt pay enough, I got it at a discount and it was 2 years ago. I also applied for a blue card and I had missed a page so blue card people notified you to notify me that I had 21 days to fix it the first I got to hear about it was when blue card cancelled the application and I had to do it all over again. It took too long to get answers to questions and that made it hard. I‚Äôm sorry all round I am disappointed with open colleges. I want my other qualification please."

It took me two weeks to upload my portfolio because the uploading site couldn't handle the large files, the instructions in the portfolio do not give you alternative options unless you fail your activities the first time and also the staff were always giving contradicting information which caused lots of confusion and resulted in me having to redo my placement. Studying with Open Colleges has both pros and cons, but in my situation the cons outweighed the pros."

There were a few issues with communication between trainers/assessors and students. Students are always on email and some of us work full time so don't have access to open space - if there is an urgent need to communicate with a student a phone call would be appreciated, especially when it comes to resubmitting assessments before a certain date.   There are also some trainers that need to learn to communicate better with students when correcting assessments and giving feedback - they need to learn to be specific in their questions for more information so the student can answer correctly.

2,2018-10-25T23:46:00.000Z,Would not recommend to anyone.,"Would not recommend to anyone.Very little support was offered throughout the entire experience with Open Colleges, you really are left to your own devices, with no follow ups if you are falling behind or don‚Äôt look like you will be finished within the allocation course time.Student support will never give you the same answer twice, it would also depend who you got on the phone that day, they were always more than happy to keep offering extensions as long as you paid for them.I did take longer to complete my course as I was working full time as well so I was aware I was falling behind but still not a word from anyone, just a generic email each time the course expiry was reached saying sorry you didn‚Äôt finish.Any time I did try to contact faculty they were obviously so under staffed that it could takes days to hear back from anyone with your own means of contact through Open space, which is not ideal if you are in the middle of an assignment and just need some quick advice.If you are looking to study, unless you are extremely self motivating and require very little support or communication, I would not recommend Open Colleges at all. They truely are just out to sign as many people up as they can, lock you into your course fees and then they couldn‚Äôt care what happens from there.I must add some of the faculty I did encounter along the way were kind and passionate but I think their resources were so far stretched they couldn‚Äôt possibly offer sufficient support to each student."
3,2018-10-25T23:21:59.000Z,Cert IV in Vet Nursing,"The course itself (Cert IV Vet Nursing) has been okay, the assessments were fine but the feedback was rubbish - oftentimes assessors would not even read my answers and immediately ask for a resubmission when I've actually answered correctly. There's alot of reviews speaking about time waiting for marking; I personally haven't had this issue, in fact sometimes the assessors are too quick and don't read carefully your answers. Theory assessments have too many spelling errors and ambiguous questions with no real guidance and don't get me started on the Portfolio. It's much better since they separated it into two folios, but the workload is absolutely excessive and half this stuff could of simply been assessed throughout the course or by doing a day visit to my clinic and watch me perform the tasks. This is coming from someone who works in the field and has done a higher degree (Bachelor's) and I didn't even have this workload at University. There's been a changeover of staff and I rarely have any idea who to contact, and the Student Support online form is absolutely useless - you never get a response and it's obviously not manned at all. I'm very close to completing my last folio and finishing the course yet I have no direction as to what happens next? When is the final report marked? What happens with the certificate? Is it mailed or emailed...As usual left entirely on my own with no info. This course definately needs work, and the folio needs an overhaul. I highly recommend students looking to enter this course 1) are working in a clinic because placement is IMPOSSIBLE to find even with the assistance from the College, 2) be warned the folio is a huge waste of time and will be extremely discouraging and difficult to complete, 3) you are on your own, and will have basically no support. Best of luck to those students currently studying and I hope you all graduate because you earnt it and you deserve it."

I was about 3 modules into the Graphic Design course when I realised that it was  not the right fit for me. I tried to cancel the remainder of the course but was told that I would need to pay the full fee based on the contract I signed. $8000 is a lot of money to just throw down the drain so I completed the course with much resentment. The course itself was average. Most of the training is based on links to other websites and many of those links are broken. When I finally completed the course, I did not even get an email to let me know what would happen next... no congratulations or even  information about when I will receive my diploma. Honestly, I feel like Open Colleges just wants your money and I would not recommend them to anyone."

But then the portfolio was awful. It was like the standard went from anyone could do it to the Vets (who had done 6+yrs of uni) couldn‚Äôt even answer questions in it correctly! I resubmitted three times, each time taking three months to mark and everytime there was different comments on questions or more questions they didn‚Äôt deem correct. In the end most of the answers I gave didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the original question. There are no guidelines as to how to present the portfolio so I was required to re-do numerous photos and videos ‚Äúbecause my face wasn‚Äôt in them‚Äù which is difficult in a small busy practice as no one has time to film me during a surgery! In the end it was over three years until I was finally told I had passed and then another months until I received my certificate."
1,2018-10-24T19:53:26.000Z,Would not recommend!!,"The course work was unnecessarily excessive, was obviously not proof read, and was  incredibly repetitive. Staff would take a ridiculously long time to reply to emails making it hard to get the support and assistance you needed to get through the assignments, and when the transition began everyone would tell you different things so no one knew what was going on. I would not recommend Open Colleges to anyone."

I feel that i have learnt a lot throughout the course and i am a lot more confident now in how i will respond in any given situation or circumstance using the methods and courses of action taught throughout the various modules. Trainers/ Assessors used positive/ encouraging language with their grading of assessments and were helpful with pointing in the right direction if any answers were incorrect. Student Support were also helpful whenever i needed them which luckily was only on three or four occasions.

Despite years of experience in accounting work I found the course materials difficult to get through due to numerical errors in the course materials and poorly written, vague and ambiguous wording of the questions in the assessment tasks. It seems that a lot of the materials are distributed without being checked for clarity, grammar and punctuation errors. These errors led to days spent answering a question one way, only to be told they were asking a completely different question. Student message boards show that I'm not the only one.The subject matter is straight forward enough. The way it is presented to the student is not.Some assessors were dismissive of my questions when I asked for clarification.Not worth the money. Go to TAFE instead."

Yes it has plenty of good points, but the bad points really leave a mark. Tutorials are really disorganised, and I found doubles, or even missing tutorials.As for communication, it was rare I needed to ask a question, which was great, but when I was pushed onto someone else.... who answered me like a bot. They didn't answer my question, and when I tried explaining this, I got no response.Otherwise, things seem to be laid out fairly clearly, and I've managed to get through with little communication... that I'm not sure is good or bad."
2,2018-10-19T22:35:33.000Z,Nothing is on your terms,"So hard to get a response when I had a question regarding an assignment, at one point it took 3 weeks to unlock a module because it was ‚Äònot ready‚Äô yet, there could be an extensive wait period for an assessment to be marked - which held up the next module being unlocked, and there was no assistance given in my search for work placement after several knock-backs. There was no activity on my profile for an entire 18 months, and not once was I contacted to see if there was an issue. They were more than happy to offer an extension however- at a cost.The pluses- met great people on the Fiji placement - oh! And I graduated.The last worst thing I must note though, for those people who like to feel a sense of achievement, is that the little progress meter that goes up when you successfully complete an assessment, never reaches 100%. You‚Äôll get to 97, but never 100 :( - it‚Äôs left me feeling a little incomplete and like I still have something to do!"

Not only were the theory based assignments pretty repetitive they also were marked in a unprofessional way. If an assignment wishes to have photos or figures, please state this in the assignment.Secondly, the time frame for markers to give back our assignments is also terrible. I understand at the moment they're is a current transition between the old and new Cert 3, however, in order to progressively do this you should have hired more staff or atleast given everyone more time. I was waiting for around a 2 to 3 weeks for my portfolio to be marked. Why did it take so long? Well, for starters lack of staff. Secondly, you clearly state in the portfolio that we are allowed to upload all video ls via youtube or dropbox. Please do not change this and not tell anyone. I was unaware so when I posted my assignment it had to be resubmitted therefore causing more delays.In all honestly, I will never sign up to another open colleges nor would I recommend you as an education platform. The only reason why i continued with my study was that at the end of the day I want to work with animals and I found a really good workplace that I absolutely adore."

I also wished there had been a clear information on how long to allow for marking of final (and large assignments) if I had known it would take 6 months to complete this section I would have been more proactive to get it completed with sufficient time for resubmits.In the end I put a lot of my success in finishing down to one of the trainers who helped me with timing and communication through the final parts of my course."

My online learning and facilitation was reduced to borrowed YouTube videos from the US, Google and Wikipedia. Resources, assignments and overall experience of the subject matter was quite convoluted and poorly structured.

However, when it came to submitting my portfolio, there were some issues. Firstly, I was not able to submit my portfolio due to the size of my files. That was okay, I simply posted it in the mail. Yet I was discouraged to find out at some point my portfolio had been misplaced, which I worked so hard on! Nevertheless, my portfolio was found, graded and passed so all was resolved! At times I felt communication was a bit of a grey area.Although as mentioned, my time with Open Colleges was a positive experience with only a few hiccups along the way.

THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. Also, the course content is lacking for the terribly worded questions in each assement (confusing and unnecessary in many circumstances).In this industry If you are not competent it is dangerous for both yourself and your patient and will also shatter your confidence.In comparison to AAS - this course is unsatisfactory and requires serious changes and improving of standards.I finished my course 3.5 weeks ago and still have not received a congratulations from student support. I had to chase up my graduation and still have not received formal confirmation of completion. I‚Äôm seriously disappointed after all that money out of pocket, my time and major effort studying whilst working full time.I called sudent support on Monday and was on hold for 2 hours. I later informed the mainland had a public holiday.. this was not the case in Tasmania and there was no message service to indicate this.. the phone just kept calling like someone was going to answer..I now am still waiting for confirmation and then have to wait 6-8 weeks for my certificate.I spoke to a lovely gentleman this afternoon whom is chasing my formal graduation confirmation, however I am still left frustrated and disappointed with open colleges.I know I am not alone and this is causing a severe under rating of open colleges, many clinics in Tasmania are ‚Äòput off‚Äô by open students in this industry which is affected job opportunity.Something needs to be done.I can only hope I will finally receive my formal notifcation soon."

We all parted with an unbreakable bond..we have all learnt so much and been able to make a difference in the lives of many...we all had to face personal challenges pushed way out of our comfort zones and at the same time were given the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people who have little.I would recommend Open Colleges and this opportunity to all Students.

I took part in their international work placement which allowed me to build on everything I have learnt in theory and put it into practice.

2,2018-09-26T04:48:54.000Z,Practical classes are needed.,Unfortunately this set up does not work very well.  Trying to study through the internet and communication via emails and arranging phone calls was not practical and very stressful for me.The work booklets and assessments online were okay. Perhaps more videos or recorded lessons created by the college would work a lot better instead of so much written stuff. (I highly recommend practical classes to incorporate with the study too.)The portfolio was impossibly hard to complete due to there not being any proper connection with work placement and what was required in the portfolio. A better system needs to be in place to insure the students are getting the correct practical experience and are more open to opportunity in the clinic that will benefit there studies.The college was helpful in giving me more and more time and continual extension options to amend my work. However It does get to a point where stress overpowers your ability to think clearly and in this case a break or credits towards continuing my study later would have been more appropriate for my health and learning ability. Having that clock ticking all the time does not put you in the right head space.

Read this information and answer questions, sometimes not even relevant to what had been given in the content. I found the trainers not very helpful, when I had a question (wasn't often) the problem was never addressed and given some round about answer that didn't make sense. Google helped me more then the trainers did."
1,2018-09-24T01:53:10.000Z,Stay away,"I found the whole experience with Open Colleges frustrating and at times unethical. The course itself was interesting and informative and many of the trainers seemed lovely.However the lack of ongoing and useful support was shocking. On the discussion board where we are mean to receive support, we often received cut and paste messages saying 'Good question, contact your trainer about that one'. But then when we went to contact a trainer a response could take days....The phone support too was really bad, often the phone operators were unable to help or had literally no idea what to tell you. (Especially when the course suddenly went into the transition period) The online support email also never worked. When I sent general support questions to 'Student Support' I received an automated response telling me the question had been received I would get an answer within 48 hrs... I never did to ANY of my queries. In the end the only way I got answers from anyone was to email three different people at a time with the same question and mention that I was keeping a written record of things....Now for the worst bit....The course that was meant to be 12 months long that I paid for up front was suddenly changed. I was given notice on August 28th that I had two options...1.  complete all my work placement and assessment by Sept 30th (Rather than April the following year) or , 2. transition to the new course and have to re-do four modules that I had already spent hours completing as well as gap tasks and gap assessments. This cut 7 months off my course with a month's notice.Many students who were struggling to balance work, family and this course just gave up. I know as I created my own Student Support Facebook group for the course due to the actual lack of real support.When I was madly trying to get all my assessments and work in by the new deadline the communication and marking time wasn't sped up (as it should be when we suddenly have only a month rather than 7 months). Rather we were told marking would now take up to 10 days rather than 5-7 due to the trainers being inundated with student work. (Of course they were as everyone was in a panic.) More trainers should have been hired due to the course change to help students get across the line.And MORE notice should've been given to everyone about this course transition. In my view Open Colleges should not have been able to accept new students in May when I enrolled if they knew a course change was occurring.Really, really disappointed with my experience. I hold nothing personally against individual trainers who were mostly lovely, but the organisation itself needs to be held more in account. Hire more staff and communicate properly with your students. The support you promise when we sign up is not there!!!"

Just recently I might not be able to complete my course because I can't do my work placement as Student Support never got back to me and when they did they said it would take 7-10 days to approve when I was already booked in to start my placement and as I live in a country area cannot complete in my home town and have taken time off work, paid for accommodation and travel costs and still they cant process my paperwork as everyone I am dealing with is conveniently on leave.I can't leave the course now as I paid upfront not weekly and whether I complete the course or not they have my money"

Every contact I had with them was handled extremely competently.But if you are looking at any Fashion Design related course go to a TAFE."

2,2018-09-13T01:42:18.000Z,Do not study online,"Studied Certificate IV in Information Technology:Open Colleges provided flexibility for my course time and had no issues with course extension when required. Calling student support was easy and they seemed helpful at times.HOWEVER, the material was often incorrect, and out of date.The Windows Intune section was appalling at best, my own teachers were not able to instruct the best way to complete it, and it had to be elevated to much higher authority. I ended up solving it with external help as no-one at open colleges could assist.Furthermore, in the final work placement with the server setup, the commands provided to input in Ubuntu terminal were incorrect to the point that they were actually BACKWARDS. The instructions are just YouTube videos from 5-6 years ago that no longer hold any merit in this ever evolving field of technology. Open College material didn't explain WHY we do thing, they only gave instructions on exact commands to complete the task, with no explanation of the commands themselves, what they do, how it works or why we use it, and even these commands and steps were INCORRECT and had my work-placement supervisor scratching his head in disbelief.Furthermore, teachers often don't respond to questions and required help for at least 2 days. My workplace assessor didn't respond to anything on open colleges website and insist you email him directly, which he took upwards of 7 BUSINESS DAYS to do so. This is the main reason students fall behind and seem to not be able to catch up. Often their help is just as generic an answer as they can give supported by ""we encourage you to solve this on your own"".Looking for work placement was a goddamn nightmare which open colleges provided NO HELP for, EVEN THOUGH they said they would. When I applied for their assistance, they responded with ""Just look yourself, us helping you is a lengthy process that takes several months"".When I did attend work placement, my open colleges workplace assessor was supposed to contact me every day to see how I was going and to assist me in any way he could. I did not receive a single phone call, email or private message of this at all, leaving me to feel unsupported by my course.The work placement booklets are a mess. They have 3 booklets of the SAME EXACT THING, and if one of them is incomplete, YOU WILL FAIL. There is no guidelines to tell you which booklets you need to complete or how you are to complete them. 1 booklet is the outline of activities you need to complete, 1 booklet is signatures from your assessor saying you have completed that activity, and 1 booklet is your comments on the activity after you have completed them. How hard would it be to just MERGE THIS INTO 1 BOOK?! And on the subject of the booklets, why do we need to do a million authentications of our work? I can understand 2 authentications, but 5?! On the most ridiculously typical tasks that a 6 year old can achieve? You're out of your goddamn minds.And just to cap it all off, the amount of spelling errors, incorrectly punctuated paragraphs and sentences lead to the overall feel of the course to be both CHEAP and UNPROFESSIONAL.Online study surely provides flexibility, but you sacrifice both quality, effort and any support promised to you and it will leave you in more stress and anger than you would have ever thought."

The reason for four stars and not five Is that the turn around time of some of the assessments were to long.  Especially if it's not satisfactory yet.  Other than that I will study with Open College again. In the future.  The assessors and support staff were always very helpful and friendly.  Thanks for a great experience Open Colleges.

I would have liked more critical feedback on what I actually designed. Many of the assessment tasks in my opinion are irrelevant to the career (as in the Interior Designers wouldn't be doing this so why are you asking us to answer these types of questions) and stupidly repetitive in relation WHS. I think it would be great if there was more face to face lectures through Skype or even through facebook live streaming. The assessment tasks are generally very poorly written and often confusing as to what's being asked of students. I was thankful somebody set up a facebook group independent of Open College for students to help each other out, as the course trainers were often too slow to reply and sometimes gave cryptic advise."

The student discussion boards are filled with questions and comments from frustrated students trying to access things that don't exist and receiving the same 'sorry' reply in return - some of these are repeated for 2yrs and the same pathetic response is provided over and over again with no noticeable improvement on quality.Their staff are nice but unable to do anything as there appears to be no review structure, few senior staff who actually take responsibility and a total lack of logic within their flimsy course structure. When I brought the problem of the broken inks to their attention, they actually asked me to go through the materials myself and send them a list of all the links that needed updating!! Isn't that their job?!?!The material I paid thousands for seems to just be a reference list to other people's work and nothing is actually written by the people at Open Colleges. They appear to just 'copy & paste' sections from other websites and then paste the link for you to go and read it again - a total waste of time for everyone. I question where the money actually goes and what I really paid for as it definitely wasn't for the production of a real world, well structured or engaging educational experience.I would never recommend Open Colleges to anyone - use another supplier there are plenty out there!!!"

The major downfall of the course is the long marking time for the portfolio. There are people submitting portfolios after people and receiving their feedback/grades quicker which isn‚Äôt acceptable.

My first submission took 4 months to grade, and then  2 months the second time.In between this I also had to then pay for 2 or 3 extensions so I could finish my course which I think is a bit harsh seeing I paid a lot for the course.I would recommend open colleges to others as the convenience of online work is fantastic but the grading time frame is not."

5,2018-09-06T11:30:21.000Z,My study experience with Open College,"Hi. I am really happy with open colleges. I had such wonderful learning experience with  open colleges for the last few months, I am already looking forward to do some more carrier development courses with them.  My course coordinator, assessor all were really helpful and appreciative. Thier encouragement made it easy for me to complete  the course after going through a lot of personal difficulties. Just a small thing I would like to mention is that at a certain stage I felt I didn't get proper outcome for my assessments as per my point of view from certain asseesors. But the assessors are not working with open colleges any more. So I don't  have anything negative to say. At last I would like to Thank everyone at Open colleges especially to my course related every single faculty members.  I Wish all the best to Open Colleges with their amazing work for students like us. Thank you."

3,2018-09-05T07:58:39.000Z,Lack of support but definitely getting better.,"My experience with open colleges started horribly. I felt like I had no support and when I called student support would give me other numbers to call and the cycle kept going until I gave up. I had one phone call at the beginning of my course and no check up to see how I was going, and no calls for the clinic I was doing workplacement at to check how I was either. It very much felt like I was doing it alone, which I suppose is normal for studying online but I didn't have much guidance. The course updated towards the end of my studies which was a pain but ended up benefiting me. I felt much more supported and the trainers I spoke to were both new and much more comforting, supportive and understanding than the previous ones I had spoken to for the last bits and pieces of my course. They seem to have lifted the experience and support for future students based on the last few moments of my course.My only other complaint would be that the questions for the portfolio, assignments and interviews were easily misinterpreted and not specific enough for us to get it right the first time. Overall I wouldn't study online again as I believe I wouldve completed the course faster and had a quicker understanding of the topics had I been in a class environment. In saying that, having the course materials there for you at your own pace was a huge upside of online studies."

4,2018-09-05T00:09:33.000Z,So far I've enjoyed my experience,"So far I've enjoyed my experience.  I've learned a lot and had few delays or issues using OpenSpace.  I did find a number of links in the course material were old and unusable and it might be time for someone to go through the course and check every link for broken ones and to ensure they're the most relevant (some were pretty old).  However using a little creativity I usually found a workaround.  I did notice a bit of trainer turnover and for some time didn't seem to have a trainer at all, but didn't really contact them much anyway.  Many assessment questions were ambiguous (not ideal in a communications course) but my guesses as to what they meant turned out fine more often than not. I feel the assessment feedback was generally fair. I do not know the reputation of my course in the industry, but I feel I had to work hard, am better prepared than before, and learning this way suits me. Oh, and all my assessments were marked within the 5 days - most more quickly."

4,2018-09-04T21:18:57.000Z,Cerificate IV in Programming with Open Colleges,"Studying the Cerificate IV in Programming with Open Colleges was an enjoyable, challenging and rewarding experience. I was able to achieve one of my goals by beginning my career as a programmer with a great company. It would have been good to see more support for the Mac OS as it was a windows based course. In my experience, trainers in the course were helpful and responsive which was a key in staying motivated and getting clarity on some topics. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Programming. I personally felt the course was very heavy on C# and .NET and not enough exploration with Java and it‚Äôs assocaited technology stack."
2,2018-09-04T11:07:15.000Z,I just want to start my course :(,"I am actually really disappointed with the service I've received so far through Open Colleges.I chose Open Colleges because they were offering really competitive prices for exactly the same course I was looking at. I liked the aspect of self paced study as I work full time.I enrolled - that went really well.BUT then I applied for Recognition of Prior Learning. I sent that off two months ago. I heard nothing two weeks later. I called. After I called they then pushed it forward and assigned it to an assessor. That was over a month ago. Now still nothing. I've called and apparently the assessors are unavailable and through emails they just state they are busy.Pretty upset, for a hefty price of $300 to apply for RPL I dont even know if its worth it. Still don't know if I will even be credited for any units. All I want to do is start my course!"
2,2018-09-04T10:50:06.000Z,Wouldn't Recommend,Honestly one of my biggest mistakes would be studying with Open Colleges.I believe the most disappointing things is marking time. In total it took over 8 months for my assignment to be marked and that is beyond ridiculous. What was meant to be a 2 year course was almost 4.Some teachers were un-helpful. I'd send an email asking for help on certain questions and I'd only recive advise on one little thing I said. As well as this one teacher put me in the wrong direction when helping me with a question.I now highly regret even doing this course because so many clinics don't hire people who studied through Open Colleges. It just seems like a great waste of time.I would not recommended Open Colleges to anyone.

I felt that the course covered a wide range of subjects that were very relevant to the work of a TA - this was evident during my placement, when I felt well equipped to work with my supervising teacher on various lessons and in a variety of situations.I thought that the assessments throughout the course were well structured and helped me to further integrate the course material.I particularly appreciated the course trainers and tech support personnel. The response to any of my queries or issues was pretty prompt and helpful.I would definitely recommend this course and Open Colleges to any future students."
3,2018-09-04T00:40:20.000Z,Informative.,"I learnt a lot. Course material was informative. Support were great and were happy to help out with extensions as required. Assessments at times I felt were confusing in what they were asking. Assesments at times took up to 3 weeks to mark and not their advertised 5 days, this was a little frustrating. It also took a long time to source work placement. Overall I think the Pro's outweighed the Con's. Would I do an Open Colleges online course again...Maybe! I think I learn better in a classroom environment."

Content was basic, online platform full of glitches, unprofessional use of Facebook by assessors and they did not use proper means of communication. Took 6 months to grade work, then to be told to move across to a different assignment if I wanted it marken. Would not recommend OC to anyone, infact would recommend anyone else but OC. Only giving 2 stars because of the help I got from one assessor in particular who finally got my work marked and was absolutely lovely despite my grumpiness."

It gave me the flexibility I needed having a business to run, a part-time job and a young family to attend to. I was able to extend the course as I needed and OpenSpace was user friendly. Response from trainers and staff were prompt and they were usually able to help with my queries.If you are not self-motivated or struggle to study alone then I wouldn't recommend this way of doing a Certificate as 95% of it has to be done out of your own motivation as there is no on-going reminders by actual people to keep going or checking to see if you are progressing ok. There is no real accountability to anyone but to yourself.I would however definitely use Open College for another Certificate if I ever wanted to further my training."

1,2018-08-29T10:17:50.000Z,I'm appalled with the student support,"I'm appalled with the student support.I had emailed my trainer multiple times throughout my course all to NEVER get a response when i needed help. and support centre doesn't properly read the emails and send generic responses.The limited phone appointments are backed up to a month and they don't even inform you to book in advance, which is beyond a joke.So now i get to sit around and do nothing for an entire month just to do an irrelevant phone interview before i can continue with my study."
4,2018-08-29T07:56:50.000Z,Review of Additional Resources,"I thought the course was great, very informative and educational. The trainers and assessors were very helpful and gave great feedback. The only thing I would suggest improving is the additional resources.. I had lots of trouble accessing these throughout my whole course. I contacted the student help for troubleshooting advice, which unfortunately didn't help. It was only on the last module of my course that the link to the additional resources actually worked for me. I also found that these resources weren't very much help at all. In my opinion it seemed like they were just repeating exactly what is written in the assessment and weren't giving any extra tips and advice on how to complete the tasks. Overall I am happy with my experience with Open Colleges and happy with the outcome of my course."
3,2018-08-29T06:47:40.000Z,I had mixed experiences with my course,"I had mixed experiences with my course. I really enjoyed the online portal that was easily accessible both via computer and phone. The student support team was fantastic and it was easy to schedule and access phone support and accountability check-ins. The student support team were extremely approachable and helpful and extensions were granted easily on many occasions. Study materials were quite outdated in some instances causing unnecessary grief where legislative matters and rates were concerned. Additionally, in most cases significant research beyond the reading material was required in order to complete assessments as the reading material was limited to overarching concepts only. My experience with the trainers and assessors was mixed, some really went above and beyond my expectations and others were difficult to engage with or get clear advice from, but again the support team and coordinators were great and responsive to feedback and willing to direct queries to other trainers where necessary. I really appreciated the flexibility of online study and self-pacing but conclude that it is not an ideal learning environment for me. I would recommend it to others who are used to self-pacing and disciplined enough to self-manage timelines, I would not recommend the course for people with high expectations or perfectionistic mindsets."

I found the course content excellent and to be honest some of my colleagues who are studying a bachelors were very impressed by the content. I felt every bit as prepared as they were doing a degree. The assessor were very supportive. The only down side were the video role plays. There were so many and finding someone who would agree to playing the part of the client was very stressful. This actually delayed my progress throughout the course. I found that my assessments were marked very quickly and constructive feedback provided.

Open colleges give you student support any time you want and the most interesting thing is that they will support you when you are not successful in finding any workplacement for your course and i am the example.

3,2018-08-23T05:09:41.000Z,Certificate 3 in Travel,"I studied the Certificate 3 in Travel, with the plan to become a travel agent thereafter. During the course, I realised that all of my required units will not be regarded as completed until I have done the essential 60 hours of practical experience in a travel agency! This meant I did not have the flexibility to take these units to another course provider as RPL to study a complementary course (Cert 3 in Travel Guide) at my local TAFE. I found this a strange policy and wonder at the reasoning behind it. Is it to lock you in as a student to complete the course?As others have mentioned here, there is a lot of repetition in the course content (lectures), and not once did I pass an assessment on its first submission, there was always a mistake, often minor that I had to correct. Often my mistakes were due to assessment tasks being unclear or ambiguous in what exactly they wanted in the required answer. I answered the question incorrectly because a lack of information was provided.I have done 3 post grad University certificates and 1 post grad diploma and so I naively thought I would blitz this course within 6 months. Was I wrong! I've now decided to discontinue the course as I am just not enjoying it- for the above reasons. If you can attend a local education provider, I would go for that option. They will help you build local contacts which can then lead to work once you finish your certificate- and this is something I only discovered after I enrolled with OC.As a positive our course coordinator was great and was very helpful when ever it was required.Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be offered as I have been doing the course for more than 3 months and I am therefore not entitled to move over to another course, despite paying the entire course fee up front at the start of the course."

In this they were great and well worth it. Unfortunately they were hopeless when it came to the work prac as consistently no one showed up for my reviews or called for my booked checkups. I ended out chasing them for months to get it done. If you needed help with assignments this was also a let down as they just directed you to the online module helpers which didn't help at all. Very hard to know how assignments should be formatted as they were inconsistent with marking. Thankfully there was an independent facebook support group which we all relied on rather than the assessors. So all up, the course was easy, it was the support that was lacking."

It can sometimes take a week or more to get feedback on assessments and get replies from the trainers. There were a lot of changes to the course so I had to go back and complete extra assessments. Student support is great with helping to get extensions if they're needed. It is very flexible so it's a great option for stay at home parents or people who have other commitments such as work. You can study at your own pace. All in all I am happy with what I got out of this experience and I feel I have learnt so much throughout this course.

I didn‚Äôt require much assistance from Open Colleges trainers but the two times I did , i was disappointed because information I required did not get through to me or was misinterpreted.I understand this was because of a change of assessor both times .As a result of this , I would have appreciated some consistency in assessors ."

There are a range of support people available to guide and help you through all academic issues. The assignments are clear and understandable with easy upload assistance.

Months waiting to be graded.,"Takes ages to grade the assignments.Course start fairly good with quick response 5-10 days after submitting the assignment.During Last year slowing down and taking up to 2 months for grading. One of the assignments was overlooked for 3 and a half months.After a call the staff promise to call u with explanation when the grading will be completed, no call made!After five calls over 2 months period formal complain lodged. Poor excuses.Employ more staff if you can‚Äôt handle backlog.Would finish 6 months earlier if not delays with grading!!!Wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless above issues are resolved."
4,2018-08-15T01:44:43.000Z,Great Learning platform for wider career options.,Open colleges have provided a learning platform for me to pursue career options. On line study is not easy and you have to be committed to the task and follow the instructions and link into resources in order to get information for successful completion.The assessor's and feedback provided by them was timely and reasonable. I had no issues with timeframes and only had issue on one occasion when a new assessor was assigned to the subject. Which after following up was rectified.Often answers to my questions could be found within other students conversations in relation to the subject.The website and log in never caused me any problems either.
5,2018-08-14T22:22:36.000Z,It's a little early to ask me 'How was my Course' don't you think?,"I think giving a rating at present is a little early as I am only 2 weeks into my 2 year course.  Maybe this email should be sent at intervals throughout the course, say mid way and at the end?  However in saying this the experience I have received thus far, from enrolling in the course to communicating with trainers has been awesome.  So yes I would recommend you to a friend."

3,2018-08-13T03:48:02.000Z,Needs more content detail of course,"Before beginning the course, it needs to be outlined that there is no interaction, only reading. I expected online lectures and more communication and interaction with my 'Lecturers'. I feel I could have just read a book and come out the end with the same amount of knowledge, but $2000 better off."

Still, I received tremendous support from the Student support team who granted me course deferment and later approved for two months paid course extension to take my time to complete all the assignments.I would like to thank the faculties Miss Sanet, Sir Rob and Miss Alison who helped me to assess my assignments promptly to expedite to finish my course, particularly Miss Sanet who helped me with my work placement.Cheers."
5,2018-08-13T01:58:29.000Z,Easy to read and comprehend lectures‚Ä¶,"Easy to read and comprehend lectures and modules, method of imparting information makes the subject not so esoteric. College may need to read through the Modules as there are some spelling and Grammatical errors on many sections. Also the College may need to revisit UEENEEE104A Solve problems in D.C Circuits; Project 34271/02 Steps 19 and 20; there are some inconsistences that confuse the students. The question refers to Figure 4 which is in Step 10 but erroneously states ""return the circuit to view how it was in Step 13"". This should have stated ""return the circuit to view how it was in Step 10""."

It meant posting files on USB which added delays.In hindsight I would do a practical course like this face-to-face rather than online. But I would recommend Open Colleges for other courses
2,2018-08-11T23:37:38.000Z,"Good course, marking wait time terrible, poor communication","The course overall was fine, would have loved to have more interactive learning material ie. Webinars etc, but marking of assessments was quick. They only sent out my course book once I called them, instead of at the end of my second study period. Marking of portfolio however,  took 25 weeks( after two complaints), I was told when I submitted would be 16 weeks which was ridiculous enough, I was not notified there would be an extension of that by 9 weeks. Six months waiting to have my final submission marked held me back in my career, as well as financially. ( not to mention I had already paid for the course prior to waiting the 6 months). Now I have passed, I still have to wait 4-6 weeks just to get my certificate. If I had known it would take this long, I would have done my course somewhere else."
3,2018-08-11T22:16:46.000Z,"Good course, not good support","The course itself was great. I learnt a lot through the content. Some of the assessors are fantastic! Marking assignments quickly and giving constructive feedback. Other assessors were TERRIBLE!! No support, and making students wait way too long to do what they needed to so I could continue with the course. It‚Äôs very frustrating when all you want to do is study, and you can‚Äôt because the assessor is holding you up. It‚Äôs very hard to get help when the assessor you need ignored your messages. There is also very little opportunity for work placement in South Australia, which no one tells you before you start!"

2,2018-08-10T09:17:45.000Z,Be warned,"My experience was one of delayed responses, incorrect information given, no communication between departments, no follow up on my portfolio, unnecessary delay to complete my course (more than 10m months!!) Very few people were able to assist me, and this assistance came at the very end of my course. I had lodged a formal complaint which was rejected by Open Colleges. Very poor student service. Would not recommend to anyone. Open Colleges would not be my choice for further studies"

I can now take images that I was not able to before my studies. The content is good, and the assignments make you have to research a lot in your camera manual, youtube, photography blogs, etc. My tutors have been great support and their advice and expertise has helped me to understand better the photography field."

There was very little guidance with how to use the tools in each of the Adobe programs.. this was assumed knowledge even in the pre-Diploma course I did which is meant to get you up to speed for the Diploma. It was lucky I had used the programs before. It glossed over a lot of the important aspects of graphic design. I really didn't feel prepared to work as a Graphic Designer after I finished the course so I basically wasted my money.

However, I would have liked some more interactive reading/learning material such as power points or mini seminars and videos to break it up a bit! My assessors were very helpful once the got back to me, they could improve on getting back to me faster quite often I had to contact student support because I hadn't heard from my assessor/s in weeks regarding a question about assessments.All in all, I learnt lots and feel accomplished and supported I just think assessors could be more time efficient and there needs to me more/different learning material to keep it interesting.Also, I would like to see things done on the home screen (where everyone can post) I'd wish it was more interactive so we could really build a community to help each other. Study Buddies was a great Idea but as an over all community I think if there was more traffic and intriguing content on the home page that would have been nicer to lean on fellow study buddies and create an even more enjoyable experience so we don't feel like we are in this alone."

There is plenty of information at your finger tips to get you started especially if you haven‚Äôt studied for some time like me. My trainers and assessors were responsive to my queries in a timely manner and I would highly recommend anyone looking for a study option to use them. I was able to pay for my studies using a weekly payment plan which was also a reason I chose to go with open colleges.

Open Colleges are so disorganised and hard to work with that these places are turning away students and Open College won't help you get any placement hours once you've paid your fees.I even had hours taken away after I'd completed them because I hadn't told Open College I was 6 weeks pregnant (that's illegal in Australia).In response to the reply from Open Colleges: I have already attempted to discuss these issues with Open Colleges numerous times but have just had terrible, probably against consumer law policy copy and pasted to me in replies (that took weeks to receive & were always from someone different) or no reply at all."

Some of the webinars were a bit long winded. And when you sent an email to one of the trainers they took a long time to respond.
3,2018-07-28T08:43:47.000Z,Full on but learnt so much.,"Overall I feel like I learnt heaps. The assignments on the whole were interesting and taught me lots.  The college were very accommodating in giving me extra time when I ran over my original finish date and, over the 2.5 years that it took me to complete the course, I have even managed to make some friends, despite this being an online course. I also found that feedback on my assessments was fairly prompt (within a few days) and was pretty comprehensive, and on the odd occasion that I wanted more, I just emailed and got it.  There were some downsides with the course though: There is no face-to-face contact whatsoever. I would have liked to have had the odd online/ Skype session to log into. I, also, felt that the trainers were distinctly lacking from Open College's own forum: There are numerous examples of messages sent by students to the general forum that remain unanswered. I much preferred the way the Fundamentals was set up, in which the trainer played a very active role. It felt less like the blind leading the blind, and more like you had received personalised tuition. There is also a lot of dead links in the course material which I thought was unacceptable given the amount of money I paid to do the course, as well as a lot of repetitive notes but in some ways this might be a good thing e.g. repeatedly returning to copyright and moral rights meant that it was really reinforced. Despite these things I would recommend the course. It was full on - so many weekends and evenings spent studying, but I feel like I have grown a lot as a graphic designer in the last 2.5 years, and learnt more than I could ever have done without Open Colleges guidance."
3,2018-07-28T03:17:06.000Z,Open Colleges is my first online study through a provider,"Open Colleges is my first online study for a more than 6months course. I think some assessors are amazing, but others lack a little bit.  I find that from studying online from WA it seems an office this side of Australia would benefit thousands. The delay in replies is over a week this is too long when you need help or a questions answered. I find that working full time and studying is do-able however its hard to contact anyone when its on AEST . We need more support for this side so that when we finish work it is not all closed.  I think Open colleges could be a really great provider if they communicated better and didn't leave students waiting without a reply.  My time in Cert II was good but i felt a lack of support with an issue with my Supervisor. I feel like people should be supported by their provider ( within reason) and I would of felt alot more supported had someone helped me in my situation with my Supervisor. I basically was free labour and learnt nothing. Very sad after paying thousands for this course. I think less time spend on paper works and more time being spent on where students should or should not be sent or allowed to go to would help greatly. Over all i loved my assessor Cassandra she was above and beyond! Course was good the online part was good once you knew your way around and easy enough to learn and follow. I urge Open Colleges to be based in WA aswell and im sure alot would be quicker and smoother. Overall i am satisfied and like i mentioned above Open colleges could be great! just needs a little more communication. Thank you"
4,2018-07-26T23:02:13.000Z,Mostly Solo Learning,It's a great company if you want to just do your course without much interaction. There are trainers you can ask questions of and a community where you can reach out to other people doing the same course if you like.

Some of the trainers are really good, but the support is terribly lacking, course material may not reflect what is actually being asked of you i.e. it's not fleshed out, poorly written, hard to follow. There are silly headings with little content in the course material..links that don't work, because assessments are years old and not updated. I had an issue with some trials on software that ran out. my trainer hadn't used them, so couldn't help; on campus id have been sent to it and one of their guys would have explained how to use ambient occlusion/indigo. Similarly Autodesk expired my license before i could finish, and luckily they are really good, and it got reinstated, and my work was all saved, but a savvy lecturer could have helped me. the college suggested an extension for these issues, but more time wasnt the problem, it was the right help/ figuring out what to do. Luckily it worked out, and i believe i qualified for my diploma today."

This is the secon time I‚Äôve studied with Open colleges this first time I was disappointed but after a 2 years had past it appeared that Open colleges had improved on there support and assignment material. I‚Äôve just finished my course in Interior Decorating  but this course was more about creating plans and elevations than about  soft furnishings and  finishes . I feel I‚Äôve studied a Interior Design course instead of Interior Decorating course so there wasn‚Äôt really anything useful within the course to become a Decorator.  It was more about drawing 3D perspective and creating plans and elevations which isn‚Äôt used in Interior Decorating.

2,2018-07-23T12:01:13.000Z,Not the experience I was wanting when studying,"I found studying diploma in early childhood education with Open Colleges to be outdated.I feel the amount of work required for students is beyond what is needed - and what is realistic to complete in the work placement time frame.I found the workplace assessments A, B & C far more then a 'recap' of units completed - the work required in these was more then excessive.The unit helpers did not match up to the units on numerous occasions.The marking is very inconsistent with the changing of asked for each unit/workplace assessment.The expectations of a student on placement is excessive, students are not able to access all personal information of families and children.Asking students to find ""errors"" in policies and procedures and raise them with director  and express ways to 'improve' them is not something a student should be expected to do.To recieve feedback saying ""at diploma level you should be giving more information"" is not helpful or needed - at the time of studying a student is not at a diploma level.I found lengthy delays in receiving replys to messages sent to assessor's.I did however find the student information line very helpful, friendly and fast acting."
2,2018-07-23T03:26:52.000Z,Would not recomend.,"Studying Vet nursing through OC was far more difficult than it needed to be. There was virtually no contact from any teachers or support staff, no one checking in on progress, feed back from assessments was lacking and the wait time for marking was a complete joke. It felt as if they were setting you up to fail or run out of time. Information given at sign up was incorrect and misleading.Word of mouth is OC is no good, its students will definitely find it harder to get work with OC on their resumes.Completion of the course relies heavily on work placement providing training and education as offered course material is severely lacking in quality. Students must be able to self educated in order to pass.Marking criteria of assessments is a mystery which is very frustrating and unprofessional. The waiting time for the major portfolio assessment was 4 months. No joke, 16 weeks of nothingness, then a further 2-4 weeks for the resubmission marking (which, due to the lack of marking criteria and guidelines, everyone must submit their portfolio more than once).One good thing about the Open is that the staff are lovely once you actually do get to speak to one of them.I am just so glad its over and I was able to complete the course even though the stress it caused made it almost not worth it."

I had two years to complete it in which I did but I have seen a lot of other people not completing it in this time frame. I worked with other trainee nurses in my clinic that went though other TAFEs and they had a way more smoother course experience than this. If you are not motivated enough, this course is very hard to complete. It is strictly online and the communication is not great between students and assessors. The instructions they give you to complete this course are unclear and sometimes incomprehensible that you have to do major assessments multiple times to fully understand a question and then pass. It started off good, as it was easy but other than that I would not recommend this course to others unless there is no other way they can complete a certificate."

Every time I finished an assessment I had to spend time calling student support to unlock a module (or had a technical issue- not my fault). Constant changes in trainers.

Doing my course online allowed me flexibility to work at my own pace which has been important as I work full time.

When I questioned the course tutor she mentioned that new materials were being developed. As I had invested a lot of money in taking the course, I then questioned whether I would get access to these materials. I was told I would, but I never heard anything more about it. I would not recommend Open Colleges to anyone wanting to enrol in further study."
5,2018-07-07T04:26:35.000Z,A life and career changing experience!!,"I thoroughly recommend Open Colleges for online learning. The support you receive from the administration team,  the academic support, the other students in the course and the trainers and assessors was fantastic. The content is industry based and up to date. It's relatable and relevant when you go from the theory into the practical component of the course in your work placement. I enjoyed every aspect of the course and because of this, I have secured work in this industry.Thanks Open Colleges for providing me with an avenue to change my vocation in a way that worked for me."
2,2018-07-05T11:21:32.000Z,Room for Improvement!,"I found the content in the workbook was understandable and interesting. The assessments were very difficult and confusing to understand, including what was needed, what level of detail and in what format. The forum must not be used to gain feedback on the issues raised by students as the same issues are raised over and over again without any corrective actions. There are questions in the quiz's that have more than one correct answer but if you pick the wrong one it makes a substantial impact on your grade as there are only approx 10 questions. This would be evident if you looked at the high percentage of students getting the same answer wrong but it feels like from a student prospective that it is either too hard or you don't care.I found the trainers were knowledgeable and helpful most of the time, on a few occasions responses to questions were answered privately , which may be appropriate but afterwards the answer should be added to help others. If questions are not going to be answered within 4-5 days, it should raise an alert pay more overtime get more trainers what ever it takes!Overall this course has highlighted to me that those in charge of this course would benefit from a refresher course in management."

5,2018-07-03T20:50:42.000Z,A really good course to have under your belt if your dream job is a Fashion Designer!,"The best thing I've ever done for myself for a long time. I've enrolled the Diploma in Fashion Design and Merchandising 2 1/2 years ago. It was not the certificate that I after, but the skills that I need under my belt to be ready to get out there doing what I love.This course is perfect for someone who is discipline and passionate about Fashion Design as it teaches you everything you need to know from fashion drawings, to pattern making, pattern grading and draping, but not so much sewing. Previous experience of sewing would give you a good start.It is also a perfect course for someone who is thinking of changing career. As this is fully online, it allowed me to work full-time and study after hours. You need to be really discipline though to be able to keep up with the work as there are quite good solid, practical assessments that you need to complete. But boy, they gave me really good experience and satisfaction about the final products that I produced. You are only limit by your imagination!Currently I work as a Software Developer and in a process of transitioning. It took me a long time to decide to switch because I didn't hate my current job and it is also stable with reasonable pay. Being in the same field for a while (almost 20 years) and I feel like I need to grow. I don't like to climb the co-operate lather and technically I feel like I couldn't grow much more higher. So, anyway I found this course online and it is perfect for me to resurrect my childhood's dream job. I have to say I was very focus and determine not to slip with time. As doing self-pace training, I've seen quite a few students could not make it. Just because they didn't keep up being persistent and consistent. They left things to the very last minutes.My advice for everyone out there who is thinking of online training with practical course like this, you should be consistent and keep doing little thing everyday. You'll be surprise how far you will go. Manage your time and divide the course to the time that you have. I reckon I did have a few breaks here and there in between (i.e.: went holiday, took time off to make garments for a competition etc.), so it's not as if that I was all the time wind-up. 2 1/2 years is plenty of time for a full-time worker. If you do it by itself, I think you could knock it off 9 months to a year.Anyway, I'm ready for the next chapter of my life...."

The downside is when it comes to finding work placement. I feel the college is not doing enough in this area, it leaves the burden to the student to find their own placement.  This is a very difficult and at times frustrating experience dealing with prospective organisations who most of the times are turned off by the huge amount of paperwork/ requirements they are expected by the college to complete before thry can take you on board. In my view the college must just establish a good rapport with organisations in every state and handle the work placements issue so that students concentrate on the actual studying."
1,2018-07-02T08:20:29.000Z,Hard course to get through.,"Book keeping Cert IV.... Course material in the modules was subpar at best, with no way it prepares you for the assessment that are long, tedious, vague and confusing. You're made to use software you don't know how to use (MYOB) therefore many hours are spent trying to figure out how to input data, or make corrections. There is no instruction from OC how to do the transactions they've asked you to do in the assessment so you're left on your own to figure it out. You're advised to use ""google"" a lot. Many times what is asked in the assessment, was not covered in the modules that prep you for their assessments, so often you're left to google other websites. Most students submit assessments they know are wrong, just to get clarification from teachers. Open Colleges was sold to me as being flexible so I could study on my own time, as I work full time, this means evenings and weekends, however, there are no teachers available evenings or weekends so I was often left on my own where even ""student support"" couldn't help me as they are administration only. You have the option of a call back by a teacher in 2 business days, during business hours, which just never worked and meant more time wasted. For a cert 4, this was way too hard to get through and I would never recommend OC to anyone else, in fact, I have actively diverted my family and friends from signing up with OC because of my own experience. I'm also not confident that I have the skills nor am I properly prepared to work in the industry I studied. So many times I wanted to just give up the course and only hung in there because I paid alot of money for it. I feel there is potential to make this a great course and I am speaking up in hope OC will take a good look at this course and make some much needed changes to it for their future students as I know I am not the only one who feels this way."
2,2018-07-02T08:13:57.000Z,My experience with Open Colleges was‚Ä¶extremely disappointing!,"My experience with Open Colleges was awful.  I would never recommend them to anyone.  To be honest, there are too many instances to mention so the short version is:Poor customer service.Poor /incomplete resources.No replies to emails to Student Support.  For people working full time and working long hours, phoning isn't always an option.Signing up for a Dual Cert IV and being told you have 2 years to complete it.  Then find out I had been removed from the Business Admin Cert IV because time had run out (it hadn't been 2 years) and I had no contact to say this was happening as someone at some point changed my email address to add a '.au' on the end!  Funny thing was, I was still having my assessment graded even though I had been removed.  I had sent an email to Student Support for some technical help and received no reply in over a month (had sent other emails and contacted the assessor)...then told by the person on the phone that they could see my email but no one had responded because I was removed from the course.  Seriously!I received some feedback re 1 assessment which stated that if I wanted to be a leader I had to lead by example and that adding dot points in my table was confusing .  This comment directly under the table that was part of the assessment and FULL of dot points.  Also told that I would have scored higher if I didn't add dot points in my table (there were 2 dot points).How is it that you offer a Dual Cert IV and yet student support don't realise that it is one course not two seperate courses.  As soon as I'd passed, I get an email saying Congrats on finishing your Cert IV in Leadership and Management...followed by another email saying Congrats on enrolling in your Cert IV Business Admin!  It took phone calls to sort that mess out too.As I said...there were many instances like this but it all just boils down to poor processes and people not being properly trained on what their job is. From start to finish I felt like it was a waste of time and not worth the paper it's written on.  I'm lucky because I have years of experience but I feel sorry for the people doing this course who are young or haven't had experience working in administration."

Sometimes, I just looked at related sites and read them.Where Open Colleges also fell a bit was communication. I found it hard to follow the advice of one trainer until I asked her to spell it out.

I needed an extension and OC was very supportive and processed it without any trouble. Trainers were also very supportive and checked in with me towards the end of my course to make sure I would finish in time.Only negative thing: sometimes dealing with student support was a bit frustrating and I felt like they were not reading my emails carefully enough and I had to repeat myself a few times before getting the desired result!Overall: Great course!

2,2018-06-29T06:57:26.000Z,Disappointing,I enrolled with open colleges to complete my certificate for Health Services Assistant. The course started off well and I get supported. About midway through it became difficult to get in contact with trainers and assessments/questions took over a week to get a response. In some instances it too weeks. I was not supported what so ever with my work placement. I organised this myself and started my work placement before the trainers ‚Äòcaught up‚Äô- I basically winged it for the first 2weeks without direction. I was very lucky to have a supportive work placement. It was at this time I took leave from study as I felt unsupported and frustrated. I recently started up again determined to finish my studies (I‚Äôve completed as of today).  I found the same issues of delaying in marking. Disappointing. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend open colleges.
1,2018-06-29T02:46:54.000Z,The worst school ever,"The worst school ever, the assessments take up to 3 Weeks or more to be Mark, then you cannot do other modules while you are waiting. Then you call and every person tell you something different. You send an email and good luck if they answer you quickly (5days), if you complain takes 10 days for processing. And then they moved modules and you keep doing the same modules twice. Waste of time and money."

Questions are extremely broad, and always require more work that wasn't included to start with.

The left hand doesnt talk to the right hand within this RTO.No support, copy/ paste feedback between students,feedback is often barely legible from foreign assessors language barriers so I personally question their knowledge in the industry and is reflected in marking the same answer wrong for a student and right for me for Example. Admin errors and tedious submission procedure for portfolio had my work sit unallocated and unmarked for 6 weeks before my third contact this time to someone who actually knew what was happening to assist me and action. Proce is more than double of a reputable organisation such as TAFE. With only a fraction of the support(i had a friend go through tafe at the same time) they will lock you Into a contract then not release your results for RPL as they include the portfolio in the unit marks. Also my cert 3 material with open colleges was more in depth and demanding than a diploma level students work requirments elsewhere.I DO NOT RECOMMEND this is a business intrested in its bottom line only. I will however give full recognition to Lyndal Wilkins who is genuinely passionate and available for her students and knows her role  and evidently many others  as she was most helpful with every contact"

Some assessor feedback was very detailed and others minimal, so a bit inconsistent.  Also, a self-paced course with no real deadlines is actually more challenging in terms of motivation than I thought! Although I didn't need much, there seems to be good support available.  I am glad I did the course, and feel that completing it  is an achievement.  I would certainly recommend Open Colleges."

3,2018-06-21T20:21:07.000Z,OC Review,Overall OC was a good experience and the course had relevant and thorough information. The website was a bit buggy at times and wasn't as user friendly as it could be. The assessors were generally very good in their responses to my questions but I think it takes them too long to reply because sometimes you can't progress with your assessment until a certain question has been answered. On one occasion I waited between 3-4 weeks for a response because one of the assessors had quit without informing the students which made it very difficult to get a response for the assessments that he was in charge of. This tainted my experience quite a bit.

After finally submitting the assessment anyway, I was told that there were errors in the assessment, and I should have had a newer copy (which had not been provided to me). Student Support disputed the tutor's claim that the new assessment had even been produced. I submitted a formal complaint regarding this issue.With other assessments, I was frustrated by poorly written content in addition to simple typographical errors. In some cases, the information given was actually wrong, compared with official government information.Do yourself a favour. Do not study with this organisation. It is an absolute shambles."

It is literally impossible to contact any of the assessors or trainers for assistance whether it be via email, OpenSpace message, or phone, and no one ever gets back to you. One of their policies specifies a ""within 10 days"" turnaround time for the Workplace Approval Form to be returned..... Well it's almost 15 days later and not only am I still waiting for mine to be returned but the email I sent 2 days ago regarding this is also being ignored. Open Colleges are the absolute worst. I regret paying $5000 to study their Diploma of Community Services. I will NEVER recommend Open Colleges to anyone!!!"
4,2018-06-19T10:51:54.000Z,"Overall,","Overall,Studying through Open Colleges was a pleasant experience.Online studying was tough - not through Open Colleges as such, but in general. Studying online required persistence, dedication and drive to really reach for your study goal which in my case was to become a veterinary nurse.I‚Äôve learnt a mountain more in a physical environment than I ever did studying online - but I‚Äôm thankful that I have an incredibly awesome workplace and team that have taught meSo much. I definitely could have benefited more from face-to-face training and student groups but was limited to such resources from studying online. This wasn‚Äôt Open Colleges fault- as these resources are of limits due to the course being delivered online.As far as assistance from the Open Colleges team is concerned, I was overall very satisfied with the assistance and guidance I received from mainly STEPHANIE Vallance. Although I did speak to a number of assessors throughout my course, they were all very helpful with the answers to my concerns and always pointed me in the direction I wasSeeking.One very little concern I did have was the wording of some of the portfolio questions. I found some of the activities a little difficult to interpret and understand of what was expected. On the other hand, this made me research the question more and provide lots of detailed information which luckily paid off for most of my portfolio questions. I just think that going forward, a more simplified expectation of the assessment questions will benefit other future nurses to fully understand what is required - so that the lovely assessors aren‚Äôt being bombarded on Facebook and on OpenSpace unnecessarily."

We were literally changing people's lives through counselling sessions based on a healthier lifestyle, I was able to initiate client empowerment, confidence and a person-centred approach. The home-stay family were so welcoming and accommodating, and also respectful of my space. The facilitators were so supportive and eliminated any anxiety I had from the moment I arrived. I have now made friends for life with the students I worked with, they were all so supportive and caring.I would highly recommend completing your work placement for Counselling in Fiji!"

On neither occasion did OC contact me to inform me of when the course work would be available.The course material had lots of errors; broken links, missing images and incomplete text.The feedback from assessors was very limited. Often they just repeated the requirement of the assessment back to you and stated whether or not you had done it.About halfway through the course they increased the turn around time on assessment responses from ‚Äò3 days‚Äô to ‚Äò5 working days‚Äô with no explanation, warning or notice to students.The course (graphic design diploma) itself covers a good range of topics and the assessments are a good framework by which to progress practical skills.Overall, the course structure is ok, however communication from OC is terrible."

This course was okay, the material and assessments are the same stuff over and over again, if you need help your trainers take forever to reply and student support are rude and not helpful at all. The modules themselves are worded in ways hardly anyone understands and are honestly pathetic. There is no communication between any of the staff. I was told one thing by support and another by trainers when they finally got back to me. Everyone uses a different marking grade ie. unsatisfactory or incomplete. There is a difference and the trainers/assessors do not mark it according to these. The process for work placement is a joke. Honestly am very upset I wasted my time, energy and money to do this course. It was an extremely bad experience and has made me think long and hard weather or not I will ever study again. I will definitely not be studying with open colleges in the future."

Later when I was having trouble understanding questions, I would book special appointments to get help, then I would get the answers wrong with the help that they provided, I even had to explain the question to the specialist because I could see they didn't even understand it. I spent more time trying to resolve problems than I did learning and most of the activities in the module had links that were down. When I called for help I was told to ""google the answer"" as the reading material was not relevant. I must have been told to ""google the answer"" about 10 times.  Finally after 18 months of STRESS and continual  COMPLAINING I got assigned a special person to help me. If you work and only have set days off this course is not for you, as it takes days and days for an answer to a question and your one day off that you have between shifts that you devoted to study and assignments is waisted. I will never study online again."

And if we need to extend or in my case get my certificate sent to me at my new address it costs money! You make $5000 odd dollars per student the least you could do is help us out and just resend it. Surely that $5000 would cover extension costs and resend of certificate! Another money hungry company in my opinion. Would NOT reccomend!!!!

I don't think I would have been able to manage a course whilst working full-time through any other means.On the negative end of things, Some of the content was not relevant and links were not kept up to date, the assessment and learning material was full of grammatical errors and typos and was clearly not proofread very well. I'd love to see a better approach to the community experience as there is next to none in Open Space and students have taken it into their own hands to make Facebook groups to work around it. There were also annoying complications when the course changed part way through - this could not be helped though the process was not handled very well."

Instead I was given an extension and encouraged to continue which led to me being able to complete my work placement in Fiji! A life changing experience!Often in life we hear the quote ""Life is what you make of it"". Well so is our education, we can either view every disappointment and setback as the end of the world or we can learn from it and become better students and more patient humans."

2,2018-05-29T07:09:27.000Z,Won't be studying with Open Colleges again...,"Most of (not all) of the assessors didn't give good quality feedback. Some of  the feedback said I needed to re-do entire assignments because I had made a spelling error (I was doing an accounting course) but the feedback I was given was riddled with spelling and grammar errors and really difficult to read. The support team that you ring were very helpful. If you have anxiety about studying I would not recommend Open Colleges. I didn't find them helpful at all- I had assignment parts that confused me so i messaged my assessor for explanation and showed them what I had already done (so that if it was wrong i wouldn't have to completely redo it all), they said no i can't help you until you submit your assignment then i'll give you feedback. I felt like this wasn't ok, so I messaged support and they just said to speak with my assessor, i feel like Open Colleges puts their head in the sand when it comes to their assessors. Course material is full of referencing errors, broken links and links to low-quality YouTube videos, let alone grammar and spelling errors. I won't be studying with them again and I have told as many people as I can to not study with them. I am very surprised they are still recognised as a training provider."

2,2018-05-28T03:25:54.000Z,"Do a degree at uni, it will be easier!","1. Your additional resources are an absolute waste of time! 99% of them just repeated the questions from the assignment. Why not just add the minimal comments that are useful to the assignments?2. Assignments are poorly written and it often took me longer to decipher what you actually needed than to do the assignment itself. (FYI - I scored distinctions and above for all but 1 assignment so it‚Äôs not my lack of ability).3. Website (open space) is extremely frustrating to use. Activities are not embedded within course content so they constantly pop up and make you loose your spot - extremely frustrating when trying to ref material quickly. This issue was raised numerous times with no improvements made!4. In addition to 3, community comments also pop up. These were never useful to me and were a constant annoyance. Create a link to them, and if people want to see them, they can.5. Given more time, I do have plenty more to say!Overall - not an enjoyable experience, and will not be recommending."

For over 2 years i have been battling to try and get my diploma i just feel like crying. Had to restart a few times unable to upload assessments and trainers and assessors not getting back to you. It's never clear who to contact for help. This company has put me off doing any further study in the future.

It was great as a general look at different forms of writing, including non fiction and poetry, but not particularly specific to anything in general - this limited its relevance to someone looking for something more specialized.The reason for my 5-star rating was the feedback received. The trainer engaged really well with everything submitted, and went above and beyond to give thoughtful, detailed and constructive feedback for my work. This meant that even the assignments which I wasn't interested in were very useful to me because of the criticism I received with each."

Content was diverse, and covered many applications of web-development and associated fields. The facilitators were always helpful and communicated quickly. In general marking and feedback was fair, and provided constructive criticism and encouragement.Downsides included finding it difficult to gauge my own progress relative to an average or other standard (although I understand this is typical of self guided online learning in general).Also felt that more weight was given to subjects with less relevance to on-the-job web-development, and conversely, too little focus and depth was provided to some subjects which would be job critical.Despite these reservations, would recommend the course."

4,2018-05-19T01:42:15.000Z,Doing this course has taught me so much,"Doing this course has been an interesting journey for me. When first starting the course, I felt excited, but was also overwhelmed and anxious, as I had never completed any online study. It was challenging to motivate myself at times, but I set very specific study goals and was rewarded with some excellent grades for my efforts. After completing each module, it helped me to keep the momentum going. The webinars for each module were so useful in helping me to complete my assessments. I would recommend that everyone doing this course watches them all. The support team, trainers, assessors and other students have all helped to guide me along the way. I was extremely nervous about doing my work placement, because although I had done well in the theory, there were no guarantees that I would do well in the practical (or that I would even enjoy it). I made the decision to complete all of my elective subjects, before my work placement, which was the best decision I could have made and wouldrecommend doing this, to otherstudents. I had a few technical glitches along the way, but always managed to resolve them quite quickly. I am really looking forward to the journey ahead of me now. I have been offered a job, where I completed my work placement and feel so proud of myself for completing this course. I have really enjoyed the whole learning experience."

I was lead to believe I was signing up for a series of video tuitions.  I would like to have had a bit more visual assistance. I also found it a little confusing to understand the full length of the course and how much further I had to go to finish. The course information says to use the Fabric selector and the fabric swatches that I received with my course information. I do not have these.
2,2018-05-17T05:33:37.000Z,Think twice before going with Open Colleges,"Probably the only positive to studying with Open Colleges was the fact that the course was delivered entirely online, enabling me to fit it in around my other commitments. However this also worked against me when it came to securing the required work experience, as Open Colleges had little to no credibility with prospective employers. (I should mention here that Open Colleges did eventually step in to assist with finding a host organisation and I cannot fault the efforts of Roberto in this respect). The course content was ok, but the wording of the assessments was ambiguous. There was a lot of down time waiting for grading of assessments in order to move to the next module. There was poor communication between the various sectors of the College and even between the individuals within a sector. If I'd known all this, I would have chosen a different RTO."

3,2018-05-16T20:09:17.000Z,some improvements needed,In general the staff at Open Colleges are very helpful & friendly. The course material could be laid out in an easier to understand format though. I found it a little frustrating that open space didn't update to reflect the course material completed. It would be handy to have a screen that shows you all of the modules you've completed in the one place. Also some of the websites that you need to click on within the course material have broken links & can't be opened or are for out dated websites that no longer have the material needed.

With working and raising my children now behind me, i decided to embark on this course to aid in my current position.  Whilst the questions were quite ambigous and left me pouring over google, chat groups and asking peers, i found the research quite beneficial.  I was pleasantly surprised with each result i achieved.  I ended up taking approx 4 months break throughout the course, but still managed to complete it with 2 months to spare.  I think working in the HR environment assisted with me in completing and understanding the material.  David Lang has been fabulous to me throughout this journey.  His comments on  my assessments were very encouraging and to receive a personal call to advise i had graduated was a lovely personal touch - thank you.  Whilst it is difficult waiting for a grade patiently, i understand there are many students, with assignments of varying complexities, so understand turn around can be approx 4-5 days.

(they say 'two year course', try 3-4 years). WARNING! The marking process can take up to 8 weeks each time something is submitted.I was told it was 'SO easy studying online with open colleges, everything can just be uploaded onto the site in the areas provided'. This is WRONG so so WRONG, i spent $75 on USB's because the open colleges site does NOT allow you to upload your work as the files are too big.Also each marker marking the portfolio should have one set of marking criteria, not a different one per student. This is both unfair and cruel.Study at Tafe people, they are more open minded and it will actually only be 2 years."

I also tried to contact support team but never heard back from them.I signed up for their course with expectation that the course will be high standard and paid $2300+ but the quality of service and course is not acceptable. Total wastage of money and time. I am not alone there are several online forums and reviewing sites where people have expressed same views about Open Colleges.

Fiona Kelly was also good at motivating me and very kind with her feedback which made me happy.The course is more set up so that you have to work by yourself. The assessment questions were sometimes worded in ways in which you couldn‚Äôt understand what exactly they were looking for and if you asked what it meant, you wouldn‚Äôt get an answer for three days and by then you‚Äôd just guessed.In the end, though, I learnt a lot and that‚Äôs the main thing.

I am a mature student looking to change careers and found this method of study excellent. I arranged all my WorkPlacement which was invaluable as I was offered work with them. Only downfall I found was the online assessor allocated to me only worked two days a week and was very difficult to contact resulting in delays with getting my certificate at the end. Very frustrating as I had a job offer waiting."

I would not recommend others to study online with them. The whole experience was very laborious & frustrating. Just before Christmas 2017 my trainer (who was great) went to only working 2 days a week, and was so busy he had difficulty keeping up with the workload and responding to emails or requests. The time taken for assessment results to be given is way too long, 3-5 business days. I have a friend who studied with another online provider & was given results & feedback within 24 hours. It made the whole process of studying and trying to keep motivated on my studies, very difficult."
4,2018-05-02T05:42:18.000Z,Great Experience,I found support and all of the trainers very helpful.All the learning materials were relevant and i found the website easy to navigate and use.Would recommend to anyone who are time poor and can't attend a campus to do training online.

3,2018-05-01T22:47:03.000Z,Work placement,"Work placementI struggled finding work placement on the Gold Coast. It took me nearly a year to finally get an organisation to accept me. The experience was very average. I reached out to Open Colleges but realised very quickly that I was on my own in this challenge.Recently, I found the Ohana, this dynamic organisation on the Gold Coast relies on qualified mentors to assist at their school and their Gen Z program. They require you to attend a free 2 day seminar before they accept you into the program. This seminar along with mentor hours qualifies for the work placement.It would be great if Open Colleges could recommend Ohana for anyone looking for someplace to do their hours."

The material provided didn‚Äôt explain much, it seemed they assumed we already know stuff like credit/debit balance. I had to spend a lot of time reading up on the internet and searching YouTube videos about it. I also didn‚Äôt like how some modules didn‚Äôt have much to do with actual accounting, and felt that time could have been used to do more hands on stuff. After completion of my course I don‚Äôt feel confidant at all stepping into the workforce even as a junior position. The replies from some teachers took couple days as well. It is particularly inconvenient if you are trying to finish your assessment on time."
3,2018-04-29T05:03:09.000Z,Great Resources - Terrible Staff Support,"This was a great way to earn your Certificate IV from home, great information and work placement modules, but in saying that staff will at times take weeks to respond to enquiries or mark your assessments. It can be very difficult to get in touch with professors and at times the modules are laid out poorly or grammar is incorrect. I am thankful that I already work in this field, as it may have been sincerely difficult it hadn't due to the lack of support, I don't recommend this if you don't already work in this field."
2,2018-04-27T09:09:38.000Z,My honest experience is I would look at alternative providers,"My honest experience is - it didn't start off well. Upon enquiring about this course I specifically questioned recognition of prior learning information. The ""sales"" person told me they can do it, there is no extra cost and I just submit the rpl at the start of each module. Turns out the information given to me to seal the deal was wrong. After having paid the amount in full I was not able to get a refund. I had many words with management who didn't believe me. After submitting the rpl it took 4 months to get feedback I was unable to commence any studies until I knew which modules I would get rpl for! Again after many talks with management and appologies I was given a 4 month extension added on to the course length. No that it was needed. Throughout the course the Grammer and mistakes are pretty noticeable. Poor for a education provider. Support was ok throughout depending on who you got. To finish I was so excited. Then the emails started coming in saying now you are in rolled in the next part of the course. Pardon! I did all the modules on the brochure! I called support who said oh no you have another 10 modules to go. I sent the email confirmation I had showing what I was sold. I couldn't sleep that night. I didn't want to do another two years! The next day I rang support again to further find out that the emails and information I was given is wrong I have finished. Soo the answer to the question 'would I recommend open colleges'... No I certainly would not."

The only thing I didn't like were the evidence components required of some assisgnmemts (video and audio) as being new to Melbourne from overseas, it was not easy for me to find participants to help me complete them and I didn't truly see how they were helping me learn. That was the only drawback I found, otherwise I would highly recommend gaining your qualifications through Open Colleges"
5,2018-04-24T10:33:35.000Z,Would use open space again,The material was easy to follow  and the website was  easy to navigate. My only complaints would be the mail box because you can't delete old messages and how slow it is to upload files.

I was very impressed with the learning material content, although some of it needs to be upgraded where links to websites have been disbanded.  Some of the assignments took up an excessive amount of time that I hadn‚Äôt anticipated on.  I was paranoid about sticking to the 100 - 150 words required, only to find that I was required to go over this to answer the questions completely.

5,2018-04-18T22:22:59.000Z,Thanks for the support and attention to detail,I have completed my certificate 3 in education support with open colleges. For the last 18 months i have had support either on the other end of the phone or via email with trainers and accessors. I would certainly recommend open colleges to others for their next career change or to expand on the knowledge base.I feel very confident with open colleges and know that if i referred someone they too would be happy with this study option.
4,2018-04-18T11:43:07.000Z,I had no major problems,"I had no major problems, help was available at all times, though I do feel some of the modules may need updating and also the instructions in the portfolio for submitting wasn't what you actually had to do, so maybe that needs reviewing. I have no real complaints, though I will see how the next two years go ."
2,2018-04-18T02:52:35.000Z,Would not recommend.,"Would not recommend.My experience with OC was, to say the least, mentally exhaustingIt's a 2 year course, which took me 4 years and an extra $1,300 because of the lack of clarification from the start of the level of detail they are after.Most questions they repeat that they want more detail, then in one question they say ""this is a more generalized question, dont be so specific"" - this can be very confusing.The questions are often too broad and not specific enoughFor example;A case study asks to write about an inpatient and discuss nursing care given.I hand 3 pages in, and get told to redo it because it has to be a case hospitalized for 36 hours or more. This would be good to have known before wasting time submitting.Although the assessors are easy to get into contact with generally, the feedback and marking time for admissions of portfolios are anywhere between 3 and 5 months. More assessors or less enrollments would be better."
5,2018-04-17T08:22:04.000Z,Great experience,"I had a great experience studying with Open Colleges. The learning material was really engaging, the assessments were really clear and relevant to the learning material. 10 stars should be given to Ean, my trainer.

This give me the flexibility to be at home with my family and study within the time frame that suited me. I could stop at any time and pick up where I left off when ever I needed without any worry. I would recommend open colleges to everyone and it would definitely be my first choice again if I ever decide to study further.  Ps Thank you for this great opportunity I have definitely enjoyed every minute.
4,2018-04-16T09:08:04.000Z,Overall Worth Doing,I enjoyed studying with open colleges. I found it easy to do while working full time and the allowances for extensions if needed were very helpful as life did get in the way on occassion.Being in Perth did make it difficult with the time difference of contacting tutors for help but overall they were very responsive.My only note would be that perhaps not every unit needs an audio assignment. I understand that they are important to establish how a student would communicate but some units I found it was pointless and it became difficult to find people willing to participate or a time where that was able to happen.I would probably study through open colleges again in the future.
5,2018-04-16T00:51:12.000Z,Excellent Learning Experience,I have really enjoyed studying with Open Colleges and have received excellent and useful feedback from my tutor. The communications from the college about administrative matters were also very helpful. My only suggestion is that the 90120 course in Professional Editing and Proofreading is updated to take into account recent technology changes. Thanks!
3,2018-04-15T09:43:50.000Z,Would I do it again?? Nope,"Course material is repetitive and assessment questions are ambiguous & open to interpretation. Need to read a lot between the lines. Assessors are helpful and accessible. Portfolio is a joke and desperately needs to be rejigged. I had a lot of trouble uploading photos and videos. Embedded in portfolio document, sent multiple USB's but all the material on the USB's was not uploaded onto their system once received, which was extremely frustrating. 5 months to grade 1st portfolio submission. Mark time definitely needs to be reduced. Think OC should cap their enrollments"

Support centre always did their best to provide excellent service. Thank you to kelly and the other assessors.Clare, the head trainer was amazing throughout the entire course and I want to acknowledge her professionalism both as a trainer and as a counsellor.. Her ease of being, her non judgemental presence and continuous positivity and support was truly invaluable and I'm deeply grateful to her and her colleagues."

3,2018-04-10T23:02:08.000Z,Open Colleges is NOT the way to go.,Open Colleges is unprofessional in letting a student start a course knowing that the course wont run for the allotted time. I was a transition student who was 90 percent through my course when i had to start at the beginning with no credits. While my assessor was fantastic the system is poor I had no end of trouble with the online submissions and wont be recommending the college. If the college knows the course is under review they should NOT be offering it. This cost me a whole years worth of work.
3,2018-04-10T04:34:03.000Z,The learning material occasionally had‚Ä¶,"The learning material occasionally had spelling mistakes. Assignments were written with very unclear instructions and was often hard to understand/interpret from broken English. Some multiple choice assessments had incorrect answers marked as the correct response. Technical glitches were also incurred - e.g. next topics not releasing automatically when the prior one has been completed and the total number of assessments for the course being displayed incorrectly at login. The number of inbedded videos in the last half of the course made the pages hard to load and navigate, but were very helpful for learning. Some links are also no longer valid so require updating.What worked well was the online 'drag and drop' function to submit assessments, and the ability to resubmit assessments with recommendations for improvement before final marks were submitted if the requirements had been misunderstood. Student Support were also very responsive and helpful over the phone."
1,2018-04-09T23:04:03.000Z,If I could rate lower I probably would,"If I could rate lower I probably would. I have poured quite a lot of money into my course and once paid Open Colleges doesn‚Äôt care if you pass or fail. I have tried to gain work experience through many places and I am being met with laughter and industry professionals saying to me that they never accept open colleges applicants because it‚Äôs not a highly regarded form of study and that our certificates mean nothing, and if they had an applicant with an open colleges certificate they would put it at the bottom of the pile. When signing up to my course I was not told how hard it is to get work placement and that there would be support the whole way through.Really disappointed that I have spent so much money and put myself into difficult financial situations so I could study and get my dream job only to be faced with the hard truth that what I have been doing wasn‚Äôt even worth it."

I had a lot of personal issues along the way, so it took me three years to complete. But all staff were excellent. I think I felt let down a little with the the study buddy system and communication amongst peers until I turned to FaceBook. Another issue I had was during the whole transition period....may need to be looked at.I found the online learning a lot more challenging than I had anticipated.  But I loved the content and the Interior Design Subjects. Thanks for the experience."
4,2018-04-06T05:59:07.000Z,Overall the course was good.,"Overall the course was good.Although there was a few things that could be improved.The student support team once contacted were helpfully and extremely motivating, although even when booking in a team to be called there was multiple (about 4+ times) where i never received a call without an explanation, was called or emailed saying my appointment had been cancelled with no help of rescheduling which on most occasions meant another week of waiting and then one time i was phoned and emailed to have my appointment cancelled and then called to say it was not cancelled ... Other times people were suppose to call for additional learning support blocks and were never called.Secondly the assignments are extremely repetitive although easy. I think it would be better to extend rather then slightly change them. This on occasions made it extremely unclear as i was basically repeating what i had done in a prior assignment sometimes in a different format or rather then an essay it was an audio.I enjoyed doing the course, business administration is usually a starter course so by all means it can be pretty boring anyway.Trainers were super helpful, although sometimes taking a few days to reply make it easier to get unmotivated to continue on."

The other thing that bit disappointing is the audio response which  I think not really necessary. But overall I got a satisfaction in completing the course.All the best."

Would recommend open colleges to anyone who's working full time and still wants to continue their professional development.
4,2018-03-30T04:04:36.000Z,Self Discipline Reaps Good Results,"My overall experience as a student of Open Colleges was very positive. All assessments were marked in a timely manner and questions answered well. What I would say though is that online study, whatever the institute you decide to do it through, requires a good degree of self discipline, dedication and patience. There is no one to bounce off, no immediate question and answer response, if you want answers you need to be prepared to do your own research and think beyond what is in front of you. As is the case with any study path ultimately the end result is a reflection of the personal effort a person has put in."
1,2018-03-29T05:50:08.000Z,Find a different provider!,"Poorly structured, releases electives first which were later no longer relevant to course under new legislation so wasted time. Core modules should be first. Outdated examples that dont apply to the average finance role. Work material was flawed, and based on feedback has been flawed for years and not fixed. Errors in quiz questions. No accountability taken by open college. Assesors are contracted so can only advise on the assessment. Course work is by a 3rd party providers so open college say they dont have controll of it. Incorrect information provided by student support.Basically stay well clear of the Bookkeeping and Accouting courses! I have not spoken to one student that had a positive experience."

I was not impressed that the course changed after a year of being on it and after getting 13 HDs I was only given one credit for my first aid course which I paid for by myself (not included in the course fees) and now I found out that they knew the course was changing but told no-one and new people joined up - that was NOT fair, the next year was good the support was good - assessors lovely.  Now it takes a week just to open an email just to tell you they will do asap your task then takes assessors 5 working days to mark and review, the staff cuts have been too much so now the support is good but VERY slow which if you only have 1-2 days around a job and children to work with sometimes I do not get an answer for 2 weeks - what a waste of time when it is so precious.  Personally, I am 60% whereas a year ago I was 85% in favour."

Online learning shouldn't mean disconnection.  Tutorials could be done once a month via webinars.  Also, when assessments are poorly worded and lack synchronization in questioning,  inaccuracies in student output and disruption to the students ability to understand the module of information occurs."

I received marks of other students by mistake which was completely unprofessional.The delivery of the course was old-fashioned. Why provide us with worksheets to learn from when we live in the modern age where we can engage in more interesting means like videos or PowerPoints?I've got to be honest, the knowledge I gained from this course was small. I probably could have educated myself quicker with a Google search.The certificate itself (Business Administration) was worth my time, but I would not recommend completing it through Open Colleges."
5,2018-03-18T02:19:30.000Z,A Great Experience,Open Colleges made studying online much easier by always being available to answer questions - even on weekends. The assessors were also very responsive and helpful through the message centre. I was given enough course materials to understand the units and produce appropriate assignments.

5,2018-03-17T08:19:00.000Z,Excellent guidance,I chose Open colleges because online study was the best option for me and the fee charged was the lowest compared to the other institutions.

So I had to start all over again with no credits. Why didn‚Äôt they warn me when signing up? Next, for the second course I was only given 10months to complete (until I rang up and this was changed). The time I could receive support was when I made an appointment, for in advance, so if it didn‚Äôt fall on a day my daughter was at daycare I couldn‚Äôt do it as was too hard having her home. Every time I rang ‚Äústudent support‚Äù they couldn‚Äôt help me, the only time they were useful was when they wanted to take my money. The only time I heard from student support was receiving my marks for assignments and if I needed to make a payment. Open colleges was good for being able to do it at your own pace whenever you wanted but very difficult if you don‚Äôt have flexibility, such as having young children."

Other than the video I will give much appreciation to the assessors who always do a wonderful job in marking my assessments. Thank you for the teachings.SincerelyChris

4,2018-03-13T21:59:13.000Z,Convenient way to study,I found the course material very extensive and easy to understand. The Trainers were always very quick to respond to messages and do the marking. There were some errors in the course material which caused some confusion at times but that was only minor and a quick message to the trainer solved the problem. I would recommend Open Colleges.
3,2018-03-13T00:42:59.000Z,"Overall a good experience, but the program needs improvements","Good:Pretty good phone serviceGood structure/layout of contentContent was clear and easy to learn from with pics, videos, webistes, textbook etc.Assessments were clear and so was feedbackSome assessments incl. practical assessments were flexible to a degree, which is important when the workplace has limited facilities/animalsPoor:Practical element was advertised to me as 'you only have to do 100 hours volunteer work in a captive facility', they failed to mention that a) no zoos in my area would take volunteers/students and I would have to travel interstate, b) That there was a logbook and giant portfolio to fill out, which required you to do things that were very difficult to do in some workplaces (take videos, get signed off on specific tasks that they don't allow volunteers to do for insurance purposes etc.). Open colleges needs to be forward in having a list of workplaces that guarantee work for students, and informing students before they begin the course about this list so they are aware of any travel they might have to do.Also, for an 'online course', they need a better way of displaying learning materials that don't take so long to load (a 56 page pdf with videos and pictures cannot be displayed on a single webpage, even with the fastest internet and computer, it's slow to load). In addition, assessments require you to upload 3-5 minute videos, but the maximum upload size is 200mb?! I had SO much trouble uploading things that were even 30mb. This is not user friendly for a course that is supposed to be all online.Modules need to open up as soon as you submit your assessment for the previous module. Why should we have to wait 5-7 days for assessors to mark it?Also why 5-7 business days to mark assignments? I understand that amount of time for portfolios, but one of my quizzes took 5 business days to mark, and my portfolio well over 2 weeks. The course is supposed to run over a year, 2 weeks to mark something is not great. It should be no more than 3 business days to mark normal assessments, and 5-7 for large assessments."
5,2018-03-12T08:44:03.000Z,A fantastic Experience.,"Studying with Open Colleges has been a lifesaver.I've suffered from anxiety my whole life, and it severely affected the way I learnt at a normal public school. I dropped out of Year 12 as my grades couldn't be saved and my anxiety worsened.Thankful, Open Colleges was able to let me study at home at my own pace and made me care about my grades. There were some great assignments that I did, but unfortunately, my final assignment was the worst one. Through help from friends and family, I was able to complete it which was a relief and made me appreciate the hard work I had accomplished over the 18 months I had been doing the course.I will 100% be coming back to study at Open Colleges, rather than worrying about which TAFE or University I should try to get into. The stress of no exams was fantastic and doing a little bit of my course each day rather than hours on end made the experience worthwhile."

Caused great deal of stress and ill health.Extremely poor course material - if I had not been working as a bookkeeper/accounts clerk I would never have been able to make any sense of the course.No academic support - Not told why you were marked incorrect, questions never answered.Extremely poor communications - if I had not made contact I would still be waiting for my Certificate to arrive...and it never would because they didn't inform me that they had no record of my submitting something."

Just links (often broken) to YouTube videos and personal blogs, or broad, shallow, uninformative blurbs that didn‚Äôt help complete assessments. I contacted them for help and they said they would follow me up - then didn‚Äôt. On several occasions. The wrong trainers were sometimes listed so I didn‚Äôt get answers to my questions for ages. Don‚Äôt do this course if you think you will learn sewing skills - you won‚Äôt (despite what I was told on the phone). Which is hilarious, because you need fairly advanced sewing skills to complete and pass assignments (though I was told when I signed up it was suitable for beginner sewers. NOT true). You will barely get instruction in pattern making. Just go buy a pattern making book - that‚Äôs all the information you get, anyway. This course is a joke and a total waste of money. Wish I could get my money back, because no value (aside from the few textbooks sent to me) was provided. You will literally learn just as much for free by googling, reading sewing blogs and watching YouTube videos. DO NOT USE OPEN COLLEGES."

Being an online course obviously it‚Äôs needed to go more in depth with assessments since the student & assessor never actually meet so the content (although daunting at times) I think is fair.The biggest let down for my course in particular is the wait time for marking the portfolio (the final piece of assessment).It‚Äôs one of the most crucial and time consuming parts of the course and to have to wait 5 months for it to be assessed I think was ridiculous. Obviously OC are either short staffed, or accepting too many students and the workload is too much for the OC staff.I have nothing but lovely words to say about my assessor when my portfolio was finally marked, she contacted me to say it was next in line, reviewed it within the time line she said she would and my resubmit was marked very quickly. So no problems there. I was very grateful to receive emails from her outside normal working hours.But 5 months I think is absolutely ridiculous to wait for a piece of assessment to be marked. It put a huge stress and frustration on the course and this needs to be reviewed.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend OC because of this as it seems putting on as many students as possible is more important than actually having the resources to successfully help students with their course.Again I don‚Äôt have a bad word to say about the assessors in the Vet Nursing Team, they were great. I think the problem lies with whoever makes the decision to take on so many students that the assessors cant keep up with the workload. This I believe is a common comment for this course in particular."

Every time I had to make contact with the student support team they were always very helpful and accommodating and would always find a solution. The most challenging thing about studying was the communication between the teacher and the student as this was never a quick process. As I am busy working and travelling for work when I get to study it was late a night or on the weekends and if I ever had a question it would usually take multiple days to reply which means your assessment piece is on hold for those days which can cause frustration due to the time allocation. I did find at some points when I asked questions about the assessment I wouldn't get much back which would mean I needed to clarify my question and wait another few days for the answer. Don't get me wrong I had great teachers who are obviously really busy with many students. What I would recommend is having a chat function on your site for teachers and students to communicate if they have a question about the assessment piece for a quick response. The only other issues I had throughout my studies were login issues which caused me not to be able to get in for a week with little communication. All in all it was a good experience. I am waiting for my Diploma in the Mail but the site hasn't updated for me to reflect 100% so there is another tech issue. Thank you for the experience.

It seemed it was easier for them to advise ‚Äújust google it‚Äù when a topic wasn‚Äôt understood during the assessment.The course was a Cert 4 in bookkeeping, however it feels more like an English exam as the assessments are written in a manner that is confusing and unnecessarily hard to understand.Don‚Äôt waste your time or money!"

Student Support never responded efficiently. My emails would either get ignored or I would get a response weeks later.I will not be recommending Open Colleges to anyone. Even the course information was incorrect on Open Space.Very unprofessional, inefficient, and unorganised"

4,2018-02-28T23:48:37.000Z,Cert 3 in Health Services‚Ä¶,"I found the Cert 3 in Health Services Assistance overall a very broad education. However, as a mature (50 y.o.) adult I found some of the personal development stuff a little over the top. It would be good guidance for a young person though. Also, I think the work placement would be quite difficult for some people to organise. I was very lucky to have known someone in a public hospital who was able to give me everything I needed.I received great support from my assessor Eve who pushed me through when I was stuck & encouraged me throughout."

The course content and assessments were interesting and the work placement was valuable and flexible enough for me to pursue my own areas of interest. My experience of the course was also impacted by the trainers."
2,2018-02-27T06:48:05.000Z,I felt that there was definitely not enough support,"I felt that there was definitely not enough support from the college. When I asked questions I would get very vague short answers, I don't feel like they ever made an effort to help people, 'read the supporting documents' was a popular reply....Shortly after I first started the course I received communication advising that they had changed the course and practically had to start again from scratch, it was so poorly handled and I know it put a lot of people off continuing. Recently I email asking to get confirmation of what assessments I still needed to complete as it is not easy to tell from your login. I received a reply stating there were 3 left for me to complete, which I soon had finished, only to speak to someone at the college less than a week later to say, no, you are not finished, you still have two assessments to go as a result of the change to the course when I first started!! Not happy! If you like the approach of having someone on hand to guide and help you through a course than I would look elsewhere as you will not get it there."

It meant that I could study when I was free to do so and work when I was needed rather than having to say 'no I have my course today' and miss out on a day's work as a result. It was a little slow in terms of all the papperwork be processed, but overall it was worth it.I'll be pleased when I finally receive my Certificate III in Individualised Support (Disability)."

3,2018-02-26T00:18:29.000Z,"Overall I enjoyed my Diploma, however...","Overall, I enjoyed completing my Diploma with Open Colleges however there is definitely room for improvement. I found, especially in the last couple of modules, that the learning material was not sufficient enough to complete the assignments. Also, the links in the materials are now quite dated, I found viewing You Tube clips for Marketing from the mid-2000s were missing information relevant for today's marketing. The Open College portal was also quite temperamental and would often crash. My tracking dashboard was always incorrect as it tracks against all 10 modules it seems and not the 8 which we are required to complete."
2,2018-02-25T22:37:18.000Z,Would NOT recommend! Don't get tricked in to it!,"If you inquire about this qualification - they will persistently convince you to sign up to a fortnightly debit for 18 months - they'll offer you a deal if you sign up immediately, it's just a marketing ploy. It is really not worth the money. Also consider having that amount of money direct debited - if you're on Centrelink support or have low income absolutely avoid this. It doesn't sound like much but on a week when you're struggling, it really is. There is no way of opting out of the repayments once you have started (unless you have crisis circumstances).Assessors rarely respond to student comments or questions and it is clear in the assessment structure and questions that little care has been taken to ask relevant questions. This certificate will not qualify you to work effectively with or understand young people - but having a certificate on your resume may give you the confidence you need to apply for jobs. If you're brand new to youth work It'll give you a basic understanding of everything you need to know (safety, ethics etc) - but if you already work in the sector I would really not recommend, instead seek professional development opportunities!! If you have just left high school, or, you‚Äôre returning to study - this is not the place for you. It is not supportive and poorly put together. A very small percentage of people finish. Go to a TAFE in person - or volunteer at your local YMCA and they will train you as you go."

I was able to get the help along the way that was needed, made a few friends though the study buddy process which will be keeping in touch with and learned to love getting back to the books all over again.The practical side was amazing and made it clear to myself that this was/is the right industry that I have chosen.  I am now working for the place that I did my workplacement for and loving every shift I do there.The staff/assessors continued to help me when sometimes I found it hard and everything just seemed to fall into line.  I will miss the atmosphere of Openspace where it was nice to go and catch up with others doing the same course as me, a place where I felt I belonged and was accepted/supported!  I will be going through Open Learning again in the future for study and have already encouraged a few friends to give it a go aswell.  Thank you Open College for making this entire process not only an informative one but also and enojoyable one.I DID IT!"

I only had my practical hours left to do when they updated their course, made me start from scratch again and would not provide an extension. I found i was often answering the same questions multiple time for different assessments, and when help was required the feedback given was poor. I also found the requirements for work placement quite repetitive. The material provided was often poor and filled with grammatical errors and resources we were unable to open."

The customer service team and other trainers, in particular Boris were outstanding, but I felt that the trainer assigned to me, Matthew Burns, was in opposition to me in a few areas, in particular my TE gym and tieing up the loose ends to have me certified to move onto my cert 4 studies.  Based on this experience I wouldn't recommend or revisit Open Colleges in the future."
2,2018-02-23T04:02:27.000Z,Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care,"When I signed up for the course I was told that as long as I had completed Year 10 and could write a business letter then I would easily be able to complete the course. This could not have been further from the truth! I found the course exhausting, stressful and the assessors for the most part very unhelpful. I would ask them questions and for the most part would get absolutely no reply. The written material provided for each module was often quite poorly written and I needed to do a lot of extra research to get a true understanding of certain topics. There was a couple of trainers that were absolute superstars but I unfortunately only came in contact with them as I was ending the course. Many of my now colleagues that have worked in the childcare industry for years (some of whom have completed their Bachelor) were truly shocked by the volume and complexity of the work I had to get through during my work placement (it was truly staggering) - which ended up taking far longer then I had thought it would as a result. With the greatest respect to Open Colleges I would not recommend this particular course - I would HIGHLY recommend (if you've never worked in the childcare industry before) that you do your Diploma on the job through another provider as I know for a fact that the workload will not be nearly as heavy."
5,2018-02-23T03:02:26.000Z,Review,I completed the Certificate in Professional Editing and Proofreading and would have no hesitation in recommending Open Colleges to anyone looking to complete this course.
3,2018-02-23T02:19:44.000Z,A little disappointing,"As my first foray into studying since leaving school in the late 70's, Open Colleges seemed a reasonable way to obtain a Certificate in my chosen field as I wished to study online, at my own pace. I found some of the course material lacking in substance (and definitely lacking in grammatical correctness) and I found I needed to do a lot of additional research to ""flesh out"" the subjects. If you wish to be spoon-fed up-to-date and comprehensive written material & resources, structured, regular webinars & tutorials and real-time feedback & help, then I suggest shopping around, this may not be the option for you."

5,2018-02-22T04:08:52.000Z,10/10 would recommend.,Completing my course in Youth Work has even very straight forward and easy to progress through. The site is set out in a very user friendly way and the contents are organised efficiently. I feel I did not waste any time reading unnecessary information and all the information was useful in completing the assessments and quizzes.The trainers and assessors were very helpful in getting every assessment over the line and provided great feedback in a timely manner.It was easy to manage time as it was easy to foresee exactly what needed to be done in each Module.I would 100% do another course with opencolleges for further qualification without hesitation.The site was also functional across all devices which made getting through the material so easy!
5,2018-02-21T03:25:25.000Z,Great experience,"Great experience! The material was sufficient, easy to understand and exercises of all range to gather experience.

The course info was very helpful but needed to be more thorough. the Assessments had a lot of grey areas where more than 1 answer could have been produced but the assessors seemed to only accept the answer they wanted which didn't seem to be how it would happen in the real world. all in all I was quite happy with the course provided and have recommended it to a friend.
4,2018-02-20T06:26:45.000Z,Open Colleges Review/ Diploma in Community Service,I would recommend Open Colleges for on line courses. All staff have been friendly and obliging with my queries. The only disappointment i have is sometimes not hearing from assessors for a couple of days. I did learn to be persistent with seeking answers. The price of the course was better than other comparable valued Institutions. I liked the format of the Open Space web access; easy to navigate around. I liked the flexibility of doing the course at my pace.

2,2018-02-18T02:01:11.000Z,Unpleasant experience,"It was quite an unpleasant experience for me as a first time student and being online. It wasnt made clear to me in the beginning that the course would change and I would need to start again after already completing3 modules. And then after finishing all Modules it took 6 more months to find placement. I will say that Open colleges  (Roberto and Paolo) were very quick to respond, once I had gone through the long process of sending in what felt like another long essay to prove that I had looked for placement. This process was very long and stressful and I believe needs looking into. Even a list of places that do take online students for us to look up.There needs to be more assessors out in the flield 3 for the whole of Australia seems to be lacking. And also More fulltime trainers to be available for help throughout the course.Thankfully my workplacement was wonderful experience with loads of help and actually Tafe trainers on staff. Although workplacement should have been about more hands on work practice I also found 8  hours of working and then going home for another few hours a day to do assessments far too much. The supervisor and your workplace buddy are all trained experts in the field and should be able just to sign you off on the tasks necessary. People who have to travel away from home and with families would find it all very overwhelming.I would love to do more study but will not undertake another course with Open colleges and would not recommend them for study."
1,2018-02-17T23:33:30.000Z,I will not be recommending Open Colleges to anyone,"I can only speak for the course I did, but I will not be recommending Open Colleges to anyone. In fact I will be actively telling people to stay way. Don‚Äôt waist your time and money.Many times the readings did not cover the assessment questions. Some of the answers and readings relating to the assignment question were often not available until the next module. So only once I passed a module would I be able to see the relevant content.I found some of the staff very patronising at times and would have to wait weeks for something to get done on their end. One question I asked about an assignment was answered 2months later on the forum.The work placement component of the course was heavily reliant on the student being taught by the workplace taking them on for placement.  Considering this I found it shocking to know that my boss was never asked about her qualifications or any details about her business (luckily she has been teaching for many years and was a very supportive mentor).Once I had finally completed all the assignments and had been congratulated for finishing, I contacted student support to ask what I needed to do now.  I was told that they could see I have completed all the required assignments and that I was done. 3 weeks went by and the very week my course was expiring I was contacted saying they had updated an assignment and I would need to re-do it before I can graduate. I had completed that assignment 6 months ago and it was updated 4 months later. I found this completely unreasonable, unprofessional and immensely frustrating.Overall I feel the knowledge I have gained from this course is less than adequate. It was a very disappointing and frustrating experience."
2,2018-02-17T23:18:27.000Z,Regretful course.,The actual content was good. Learnt a fair bit. But would love to learn more about the law and policies more in depth. But the service and getting help was horrible. Waited days and even then the reply most likely was not even helpful. Felt like there was no communication or community. No since Of help or guideness. Would never do an online course again.

Looking back I have to say I enjoyed it because it was so diverse from what I have been doing most of my working life and Defence Force career. The two placements really cemented my desire to be part of the aged care industry. In saying that, those placements expanded my ability to get through the rest of the modules, particularly Module 4 relating to dementia. I had some difficulty with the video submissions for Module 3; such as material being submitted and lost but we got over that. The very nice and friendly email notifying me of completion once assessment 3 from Module 8 was assessed was just brilliant and more so when I got home yesterday and found a nice white envelope on my doorstep containing the Certificate III and transcript. It's been a terrific experience and most rewarding - thank you all at Open Colleges!"

Their openspace page was easy to access and understand. (Although unless it already exists I would love an offical iPhone app for it as it‚Äôs very laggy using the website via mobile and even deleted my info on my profile once logged in on my phone) It‚Äôs nice to receive emails to indicate how much longer you have until your course is finished but I would like someone to actually call and get in contact should I be falling behind and have a certain amount of time left as this happened to me twice. However everything else was very positive about Open Colleges and they way they operate. Kind, friendly and fair with grading, I would go with them again for any future course I may pursue. Thank you!"

1,2018-02-14T22:24:16.000Z,I would never study with Open Colleges‚Ä¶,"I would never study with Open Colleges again.  As a professional who has worked in banking and finance and done financial accounting courses in the past, the quality of the course material for Cert IV Bookkeeping was very below standard riddled with accounting errors, spelling and grammatical errors.   I lost motivation.  Delays with activating MYOB files, ambiguous materials and instructions and lack of student support kept me stopping and starting activities and assessments.  There was only one Assessor who deserves a mention and her name is Kimberly Kim.  She went out of her way to help students.  There are 2 assessors who I sometimes felt I was training the trainer.  One arguing with me about an error in the material, telling me she has a master‚Äôs in accounting only to end up telling me I was right. The other assessor provides cookie cutter feedback.  Module 9 Complex spreadsheets and Budgets had college errors in the assessment.  When given a figure to make sure I was on track, I found the college had not even applied an increase to an item which we were expected to do in the assessment.  When I queried this the response was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give students the answer‚Äù.   I‚Äôm not asking for an answer, I was asking to understand why her figure was wrong.  I didn‚Äôt get any response.  Another Assessor rejected a submission because he said, ‚Äúthe verbal recording was not long enough‚Äù.  We had to verbally record 2 short answers which at the most should be around 3-5 minutes. After I complained I found there was no minimum length for the recording.  Module 8 for Document Creation was the most useless module.  We were given templates (not ones we had to create ourselves).  It was more about drafting and finalising emails, memos and minutes, tracking, using spelling checker based on a scenario but applying their style guide which was probably the ugliest I have seen.  Most students including myself found it was easier to skip reading the modules and just go to the assessments and use Google to help us through.  When you provide feedback to the college you find they don‚Äôt take it on board nor correct the mistakes you find along the way.   I have recently completed the course but the poor structure, the delivery and below average course content are not enough to give you the confidence to work in the field.  Many students I have also helped over the 2 years don‚Äôt feel they have the skills to enter the field of bookkeeping.  I remember when I originally signed up that I asked about whether we would also be learning Xero and was told we would be but only MYOB was used in this subject.  It‚Äôs the usual sales tactics to just get your money.  When you sign up you are given only a certain amount of time to opt out but unfortunately, it‚Äôs way too early to know the frustrations that loom ahead."

But after the government interfered and changed the course content, I was forced do a Statement Of Attainment in Fitness before I could start Cert IV. This added an extra year to my studies, and then when I finally was able to start Cert IV, I discovered it was over double the length of the Cert IV I originally signed up for (with 9 modules instead of 4). The experience was therefore not at all what I signed up for, and if I could get a refund and not do Cert IV, I would, but Open Colleges will not do that, despite the fact that the product I bought is vastly different to the one I've experienced."

The Order of studies and Grades sections of the websites made it difficult to know where you were up to and the results column wasn‚Äôt showing updated results.There were some broken links in the course notes and probably way too many links to other sites.The tutors were fabulous."

I had to face tremendous hardship just to install those in my computer. Even it is uploaded in the system you hardly can work on it. So much technical issues arise which was absolutely unexpected for me. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on learning materials for all the technical issues by solving it. Secondly, the assessment they provide to complete  which have hardly 10% resemblance with the study materials which is absolutely unfair. If you don‚Äôt provide proper material how someone will able to finish the assessments. Study materials are not good enough to complete the assessments. Overall, I had really an aweful experience and I don‚Äôt think I would ever undertake any course by open college in future and recommend anyone to do any course in Open college. I feel like I have just wasted my time, effort and money by doing the BAS registration course. I hardly got any skill related to BAS. I finished my Masters and currently doing CPA but never face any  hardship like this in my entire education life."
2,2018-02-12T06:20:14.000Z,"Honestly,","Honestly, some parts of the course have been great, but most of it, not so much.Lots of waiting around and lots of getting mucked around. There are so many people involved in the process so it makes it so hard trying to communicate any need, you are also waiting daysssss for any reply and for grades you sometimes wait weeks.For the amount you pay you would expect a smooth process, this is not the case. There had been so many 'delays' and 'system issues' that it had made it so hard to even graduate, I thought I never would graduate.The material you learn is great, the assignments however seem poorly put together, especially the work placement portions. The course was also changed MULTIPLE times resulting in having to redo assignments that had already been completed.Overall if I knew what I know now, I would have never signed up with this institution."
1,2018-02-12T05:28:23.000Z,Absolute nightmare,"I started My Cert III in animal studies with a very positive mind set which deteriorated quickly. Most of my assessors took months to respond to my questions, I'm still waiting for answers to questions I asked back in June/July 2017. Some just new very little about the module they were supposed to be marking. Student support was very inconsistent, first I was told that a re-submission would take 5 business days to mark now I'm being told 10 business days. Their debit success team has charged me extra at least 15 times now, given a few were reasonable, but others were absolutely wrong. when confronted about it their response was pretty much ""too bad"".Now lastly I've been screwed around time and time again by the assessments team who know what a deadline is and just choose to ignore it. I've had to apply for my second extension because they conveniently couldn't mark my work and hand it back to me before my course end date, and naturally it takes five days + to re-mark 2 wrong questions. you know what can help with that a priority queue. Long story short don't trust this company, they don't care about you or your learning, they just care about your money. Which trust me you'll spend more than enough of ;)oh and save me your response open colleges which will definitely tell me to contact student support, I contact them almost twice week only to have them rush me through the phone call and not listen or resolve anything.Thanks,Olivia."

My course criteria was changed one year in so I found myself starting over which was rather tough, alot of the work I had done no longer applied to the new course criteria.  Unmotivated was an understatement.  However, I pulled myself back into learning and finally finished my diploma.  The assessors have been lovely.  Open Spaces not so lovely."

There should have been a list of things to complete with an average time frame of each.  It takes way to long for assessors to grade students work and I ask student support the same question multiple times and still have to follow up my enquiry several times.  They are very helpful when you do finally get in contact though.  I believe open colleges just need more staff and need to adhere to student enquiries within the same day."

The trainers and assessors were helpful and highly resourceful and the overall online learning method was fun, insightful and flexible to meet my needs as an individual currently on maternity leave. The learning resources were excellent, however the assessment resources could use with some improvement. There needs to be more clear and concise assessment instructions and questions for the learners to respond to. At times I did not understand what I needed to do or was asked from me."
3,2018-02-06T06:29:07.000Z,Cert 4 AHA (occupational Therapy),"It took 3 mths to get RPL sorted. Then I had to go to a JP to get it certified, when It could have easily been certified by a member of Aust post,  RN or a Teacher etc. In a small town (that I live in) like Manjimup in Sth Wst of WA it is very hard to get a JP to sign certifications.. My cert 111 was not recognized even tho I had also done my Cert 1V in Aged care (which supersedes the cert 111 anyway). I was told once I had done my work placement I had finished the course. I didn't  know I had 3 more Modules to do. I think things were not explained in detail and I felt lost, bullied into getting started and overwhelmed with understanding the computer technology/system used. Perhaps more detailed explanation is needed for the overall course (before payment). A run down on how to navigate through  the course is available but I am a computer novice and found many things difficult to understand. Perhaps that is due to the fact I was born way before this technology was mainstream.  Over all tho I had an experience I was satisfied with. The support staff and assessors tried hard to help whenever they could. I don't think the course suits Western Australian students very well as the time difference is a big problem.(2 or 3 hrs difference).  I know this is probably the way of the future but its not for me. I don't think I will be doing study via on line courses in the future if I could possibly help it. This is not a reflection of your course just that I struggled to enjoy the experience. I would like to take this opportunity however to thank my assessors (especially Renee Pont ) for holding my hand and dragging me through this course every step of the way. It has given the ability to do my job in a professional and confident way. We did it guys! THANKYOU again."

I did a Business Administration course because I wasn‚Äôt too sure what to do career wise and believed that this was a good starting point for many opportunities. The start of the course was relatively easy and they provide you with booklets and information for the whole assessment. There is more then enough support from them as well. They extended my course when they could of easily just charged my to complete the course. They were very supportive with a large platform of other students to connect with and teachers both ready to help you either through email or over the phone. I worked full time and completed this course in my down time and weekends when I could and there‚Äôs no rush to get things done with no timelines just a overall ‚Äú12 months‚Äù to get it done by rather then assessments being done by a certain date. Very achievable and would recommend to anyone who asked. Also very affordable, where you can pay in one go or on a plan which I paid off before I even finished the course, so no need to worry about it once the course is finished !"
5,2018-02-02T07:23:44.000Z,Best Online Course!,I completed the Certificate IV Professional Writing and Editing in January 2018.  Open Colleges provided the best online course I have ever completed.  The material was vibrant and interesting.  The Assessors were prompt to respond to my queries and they always marked assignments within 24 hours.  I have gained so much knowledge from completing this course and I hope I can study with Open Colleges again in the future.

I would definitely recommend Open Colleges to others and continue further study with them, as I found the prices are very competitive, the study website is awesome, and the staff are very helpful and understanding.The only thing I didn't like was not using the study buddy system, the whole time I studied I was too unsure of what it even involved to want to use it. I think it would be helpful to 'show' what it can do rather than tell. (still unsure if I would have used it though anyway)"

2,2018-01-30T03:57:11.000Z,Studying online,I believe I didn‚Äôt recieve the amount of support needed in this course to be able to study online. I found that I was expected to produce assessments at a level even my supervisor found hard sometimes. This wasn‚Äôt ideal for someone learning. I also found time an issue as a lot of the time I didn‚Äôt recieve my assessments back with in a reasonable amount of time due to college circumstances. The online forum was exceptional however needs to be updated since the expiration of a lot of assessments. I also found I spoke to too many people about one issue and got different responses and had to meet different requirements for each person. Overall I was able to navigate the online forum well and for the most part did my best. I believe this could be a great college however I wouldn‚Äôt recommend open colleges to my family and friends at this point in time.

I do feel it's hard to learn the practical side without the direction you need to watch a lot of on line videos and do a lot of practice on friends. it is also expensive to buy all the products and equipment that you will need to learn the different parts but over all I loved it and had the freedom to to it in and around my commitments ü§ó

3,2018-01-28T22:26:16.000Z,I learnt a lot but ...,"I learnt a lot but I didn‚Äôt like the Pinterest experience.  I was sometimes waiting a long time for a response in my photos. This make the process longer. When I was waiting for a response for so long and then when I got the response and it was negative I could have spend that time retaking the photo instead of waiting so long. Therefore, my one comment would be to maybe put more trainer on instead of having one trainer on 5 levels. Which lengthens the process when that person has to go through so many photos. Having more trainers would shorten the process and limit the frustration from students. This would then make the course flow much quicker."
3,2018-01-28T13:10:01.000Z,Project Management,The course is based online. Some areas that could be improved are the navigation of the modules - reference numbers are confusing to locate particular sections. Most modules require a voice recording as part of the assessment. Most modules and links need to be updated to be current and work correctly.

2,2018-01-24T06:35:46.000Z,Inconsistent and needs improving,"Inconsistent and needs improving - I enjoyed the course and assignments, however a lot of the questions were not worded properly or were misleading and did not fully outline what the assessors were asking leading to unnecessary resubmissions. Also in some cases the information was not delivered or taught before it was assessed, for example: some of the answers or information relevant to the current assessment were either not provided at all or not available until the following module and assessment. Overall the course was informative and enjoyable however the course information and assessor/trainer's opinions were often inconsistent and not very helpful."

2,2018-01-22T23:12:14.000Z,No Support,"Open colleges let me do 6 months of my 18 month course and 6 months in, with zero notice told me my course was getting changed. This meant all the work I had done was not needed in the updated version. None of my units were able to be transferred and I had waisted 6 months with nothing more than a sorry. The only notice I recieved was an email saying to hold off on my work until further notice. If the course was to be changed surely someone could have mentioned when I signed up for the course as there would have been some prior knowledge on open colleges side. Had I known this I could have commenced 6 months later. The change meant I finished my course much later than I had expected which effected multiple aspects of my life.Another issue I had was the turn around with communication from the support team/assessors. Assessments usually had a 3 day turn around for submission  which was fine, however any time I had a question for an assessor in regards to any of my work, sometime it would take weeks, which sometimes would only be answered after calling the support team to also try to contact my assessors.Work placement was a lot harder to find than Open colleges assured me it would be, even though I live in Melbourne Cbd. For my course, most main hospitals and clinics would not accept me for placment as I was not at one of the main University's here. Again Open colleges would not assist me with this until I had spent nearly 2 months looking. A list of places that Open Colleges knows will accept students for work placement would have been very helpful. Once Open colleges was assiting me, the only place they could find was a 4hr round commute from my house as not a lot of places want student's not doing a full degree.My assessor for my work placement at Open Colleges was lovely, but was also extremely hard to communicate with as he was usually only available on Wednesdays and therefore took a long time to get work checked by him for submission and receive any feedback.  A few times we had schedualed phone calls but he forgot to call.  It made my time feel extremely unvalued. For a course that says you will have plenty of different support and assessors to help you, you are really very much on your own and when something does go wrong, the response time is extremely slow. A lot  of time was wasted in this course and I would probably not use Open Colleges again."
5,2018-01-22T21:35:59.000Z,Thank you Open Colleges,I would strongly recommend Open Colleges to anyone that wishes to complete further studies or are wanting a career change.All the trainers were so helpful and the feedback and information that was provided was fantastic.

4,2018-01-19T03:37:56.000Z,Overall the course,"Overall the course, the material, student support trainers and assessors  was great.  I did encounter a few frustrating issues along the way, and mostly I did receive the support necessary to overcome these issues.I did however find some of the course material and assignments confusing and quite jumbled. I also found a few missing items in some of the course material, and also found that course material needed for an assignment in a said module only appeared in the following module.  Also my modules did not match with the trainer/assessor modules when i referred to a module the numbers did not match up.  I personally would have liked to do the books in an assignment from start to finish, that way all the learning material would have been put into practice from the start to the end and perhaps a better understanding of the accounting system, to see how it  all falls  into place, much like the module for the payroll, this same goes with the BAS module to have done the complete month would to me be more beneficial, but perhaps that was not for my course.Overall I am happy with the course, I certainly learnt a lot, and even though one module leads on to another, it would be beneficial to have all modules open so that if you are stuck on a module, you can move on, I did not study for nearly 3 months due to a real problem on one module which made me loose interest, and self doubt.Thank you and I hope this helps somewhat, at this stage, that is all that I can remember of the issues I may have had, but the support was great, however sometimes took a little too long for them to get back to me."

Very happy and with the Consultant who just did my new paperwork Ebony Carrick, great person to chat to you when your making a decision such as direction to go in, I found her very helpful, great person for first point of contact for people new to studies."

5,2018-01-15T22:38:22.000Z,Just do it!,My experience with Open College has been awesome. The system worked seamlessly for me and any issues I had were resolved quickly. The chance to go to Fiji to do my work placement was a life changing experience and one I'm sure I wouldn't have been offered elsewhere. My assessments were marked quickly and fairly with positive comments and feedback. I am now looking to do further studies and will be doing it through Open College.

2,2018-01-14T00:24:39.000Z,This was my first online learning ‚Ä¶,"This was my first online learning experience. I felt like a number rather than a student. The content available was okay, but I found many errors in the physics and maths sections, which initially made me think I was making mistakes but it turned out to be untrustworthy content. Messaging the various teachers I had didn't really help me - there were 3-5 days delay in responses. This meant I'd hit a roadblock and either have to wait and stop studying creating timely delays, or go on with study, feel confused, get a reply finally, reply back and forth a few times, and it'd take weeks to resolve. It's not the individual teachers fault I learned, they're employed as contractors who already have full time jobs. So we get tiny minutes of their time. This offline messaging made it very difficult to discuss maths in detail. It was easier to go on YouTube than engage with a teacher. As this was only a Cert II it wasn't too complex, but I definitely struggled with getting into the maths as I couldn't easily get questions answered. I suppose it forced me to try different approaches to resolve my issues, but the cost of the course and the way it's sold with 'teacher support' is a joke. Overall this course let me get my Cert II while I still worked full time, but I was pretty unimpressed."
4,2018-01-13T12:46:48.000Z,Open Colleges provided a wonderful foundation to then continue studies in a new field,"Open Colleges provided an excellent depth of knowledge for my Certificate IV. The majority of the assessors are extremely helpful during your studies, and the support team are fantastic. However, numerous spelling and grammatical errors on the reading material paired with disorganised communication for the work placement made it seem less than professional at times. Overall I have generally had a very positive experience studying with Open Colleges and would reccomend."
4,2018-01-12T15:46:03.000Z,The Open Learning concept is great,"The Open Learning concept is great, if you are the right person for it. I personally struggled at times with the freedom of no dead lines as well as the open book quizzes and assessments; as they resulted in me not feeling like I have learned all I can from this course. However I am sure that experiences would differ depending on the individual"

However, studying through The Open Colleges, they make it easier by having helpful student support and trainers who provide prompt replies to questions.Thank you, Open Colleges.

They then went and spat in my face by refusing any kind of refund as apparently their admin costs were over the $1000 plus I had paid them.Not a very professional company at all I felt like nothing more than a walking cash bag.Edit : So I got in contact like they suggested and they sent me email saying I could dispute them not providing a refund if I use their mediation services which charge a straight up fee of $440 and then an hourly fee of  $165 after the first four hours. I may have thought they were dishonest before now I think they are downright sick, ignore the curated reviews and avoid OC like the plague."

In saying this though the assessors were really helpful in explaining how to complete the assignments. I also found that my trainer Holly was really helpful in all aspects of the course. She helped me in most of the modules as welll as the assessors.

Unfortunately, some of the material hasn't been updated properly so some of the links weren't working (pages didn't exist anymore).In addition, I experienced a lot of miscommunication with the trainers & student support so when I thought I already met all the requirements I was then told I needed to do something else. At the end it got resolved but it took me since April until now to get all sorted so I was a bit dissapointed with the whole back and forward.But anyway at the end I was able to finish and the experience improved.Thanks"

So a employment agency advised me to up my skills and recommended a Cert III in B/Studies, so I browsed online and found this Open Colleges one. I enjoyed it and learned so much. When I was stuck I received help and advice. I found the workbooks to be thorough and will keep them to refer to when I DO FINALLY get a job! I found the course affordable yet not so cheap that you question the actual certification."

I cannot thank you enough for the content of the course and the way it was delivered. Carolyn Wyrsch"

There were many times when they went above and beyond to assist me with any issues or queries I had about my studies. The assessors are always prompt to reply to my emails and messages, as well as providing me with essential feedback for assessments. Overall, I would definitely recommend Open Colleges to anyone as an online course provider."
2,2018-01-08T11:11:07.000Z,Tough going,I left a high-paying full time job in the hope of changing careers and took on a Cert IV photography/design course. I was really disappointed with the lack  of support and interaction. There was little community feel. The feedback from trainers was really light on. The course-ware was about 5 years out of date which is really poor for such a course. I finally finished the course but am left feeling now that it was a waste of time as I don't feel like I have the skills or direction necessary to embark on a new career.

2,2018-01-06T01:49:22.000Z,Dose anyone review the study material before giving to students?,"Your study material quite often has nothing to do with assignments. Assignment questions are not clear and can lead to incorrect answers. Markers expect information supplied in assignment answers that was not asked for in the assignment questions. Why did the section teaching you how to use Microsoft work, excel and power point 2013 versions in 2017 come in section 8? we have been doing assignments with those programs for the whole course. Teaching how to use them might be a section 1 priority. Also why are we learning 2013 versions when its 2017-2018. They have no relevance to the current programs as they have been updated for easier use. The Help section and google were more helpful than the 2013 versions of the Microsoft programs training. In the first assignment for section 8 the assignment asked to use a font that doesn't exist in Word 2017. Even though I've completed the course now I still don't feel like I could be a competent bookkeeper, because I feel more examples and activities of material needed to be provided, to drill the methods into the learners. Does anyone check the comments or edit the learning material? there are comments to other learners explaining where an example has the wrong information from 2012, yet no-one has bothered to update the material and fix all the mistakes. I spent a day trying to learn a method, not getting the correct answers only to find that open colleges had supplied the wrong information. Although the material is badly structured and not proof read, I did enjoy learning in my own time. I would perhaps do another course online sometime, though possibly not with open colleges if all their course's are so badly set out."
2,2018-01-05T21:42:42.000Z,Terrible,"Terrible. Don‚Äôt study here. No one even recognises Open Collges so if you want to do further study at Uni you won‚Äôt be able to RPL. Plus not much support, generic feedback on assessments. The best support came from other students on a facebook group that students made themselves."

I found it very hard to find people to assist in completing my assignments (recording conversations, peer reviews of documents) which delayed my ability to complete my course.I felt that the last three modules were irrelevant to book keeping and unnecessary for anyone who has worked in business before. You should provide recognition for prior learning.It‚Äôs alao disheartening that the cover page never shows you are 100% complete.The assessor were helpful and provided timely responses."
3,2018-01-05T00:09:24.000Z,Ok but in my honesty could be improved.,Open Colleges was an interesting experience. To be honest I will recommended if you can balance out your time among other things. It would work for me If I had a correspondent keeping me in check with the workload via phone calls like how the work placement setup works.

3,2018-01-03T07:05:45.000Z,Very mixed experience,"The materials are really subpar - incorrect spelling and grammar throughout, as well as unrealistic scenarios.  There was absolutely no interaction with other students so it was very simply read modules and do assignments. Was also disappointed in some of the academic support, which was nearly non existent from some advisors.In open colleges credit, it was very accessible in getting the work, and feedback was always given and assignments graded quickly.  I may study with them again, but I feel like I would ensure that there was more stability with the support if possible. I had about 6 advisors during my time, which is so up and down. My last advisor was brilliant though and should be commended!"

3,2017-12-30T23:32:24.000Z,overall enjoyable,"Content was good, platform was good and was updated part way through my course. All assignments are case studies with some video/audio role play components. Found the assignments difficult to understand in terms of flow; it wasn‚Äôt always clear what was being asked as questions were quite vague and had an excess of information or examples which conflicted with my understanding of what was being asked.Use of the platforms messages weren‚Äôt effective, I struggled receiving replies and took a few weeks to get answers. I prefer to have correspondence in writing so I can refer back to information and have limited time for phone calls. This was stressful at times but course/assignment assessors are very helpful and willing to give second chances if your assignment isn‚Äôt quite connecting or complete.Overall good experience and would consider use of Open colleges again in the future for other diploma or similar courses"

3,2017-12-28T21:34:21.000Z,Challenging- but you gotta do it,"This course was challenging, and thorough, and has exposed my workplace as being deficient in processes in a number of areas. I found as I went I could implement straight into my work role. I could see immediate benefit however, a number of these processes take time I didn't have to implement, rather I used as a guide.This course has made me ask questions of my workplace. To question current roles and job descriptions, to look at how effective my current role is.Thank you for providing those skills.The remainder of my feedback is based on who I am and what i needed.When I started it was like a punch in the face- I didn't expect the workload to be what it was. I needed hands on support and a bit of tlc, and to begin I didn't feel I got that from the portals we could raise questions on. I wanted to clarify responses from the assessors but was advised they were under no obligation to respond. some of the responses I did receive where way above my level of expertise-so for the first few months I felt overwhelmed.( yes I think I needed my hand held :-)The student support team helped me as I worked through my study program, changing and revising as things came up in life, and that was a breath of fresh air.As I worked into this I felt more comfortable with the process, the line of questioning, and the feedback, so now after 18 months I was rarely flustered.I would recommend an Open Colleges course for sure.I would also recommend, where possible, that open colleges attempt to assess the students on what works best for them.I like to talk to people.I like to interact with people.While i understand this is an online course, I felt that I was unable to reply to the assessors with a simple 'Thank you', or a comment further about a grading i received.I look forward though, to receiving a shiny certificate that I can then present to my workplace, and start to make some change."
4,2017-12-28T03:40:10.000Z,I completed the Diploma of Accounting ‚Ä¶,"I completed the Diploma of Accounting through Open Colleges.  This is certainly a challenging course, would not recommend it unless you have sound experience as a bookkeeper or similar role as you need to have a good understanding of accounting concepts and processes.  Definitely need to set aside 6-10 hours per week as this course has a lot of learning material to work through.  It is self directed learning, very different to classroom environment so you do need discipline and be proactive in your learning as the time will go by very quickly.  Even though there were a few hiccups along the way, overall, I am happy with Open Colleges and would recommend them"
4,2017-12-28T01:06:59.000Z,A good online option,"Course work good. Trainers helpful. Would have liked a few more resources provided, much relied on own web searches which can lead to incorrect info being learnt."
4,2017-12-27T21:06:53.000Z,My experience so far,"My experience so far, has been very positive for the majority of the course.The only problem I have been experiencing, is not being able to enter the Open Space site. My login has been mixed up and it doesn't matter which login I use the page won't load up and comes up with 'Federation login error' and lots of codes, which is preventing me to commence the new section of my course.Other than this problem, all aspects of Open Space have been great. The people (Trainers, Assessors and Student Support) have been very professional and happy to help with my enquiries/questions."

2,2017-12-27T08:46:58.000Z,Poor quality study material,"Course material had a lot of errors and mistake which was picked up by several students more than 6 months ago but was never updated, this makes online study more harder than it should be. Poor quality proof read before published and erros not rectified even was pointed out.Some assessor that I came across were helpful, but not all are the same."
3,2017-12-27T08:37:18.000Z,Not for Procrastinators!,"This type of study is not for some-one who cannot manage their own time; as there are no deadlines per module it could be very easy to leave until there is too much work to be done. Although there was some email reminders and some follow-up I think it should be really put forward to potential students that they must manage their time!In regards to the bookkeeping certificate IV, I do have accounting experience however it would have been really challenging for those without experience. I can't recall there was an entry requirement.I did receive individual help when I was motivated to ask. I think the OpenSpace forums are not utilised enough; mostly when students asked a question on the forum they were instructed to email the assessor directly. It would have been more productive and inclusive if the assessor responded on the forum for all students to see and participate.Joining a relevant Facebook study group was very worthwhile.Another motivating thing would be to have occasional webinars on each module to interact with assessors as a group, eg. one webinar per module per month run by assessor to check-in with the students doing that module.Early in my course I had the opportunity to attend the college premises in a group setting to finalise an assessment with some teachers in a classroom setting. I found this really beneficial. It was only offered once for one module."
3,2017-12-26T23:23:57.000Z,Excellent staff and course materials,"Excellent staff and course materials. The website had some issues either bug or upgrade causing login problems mid way through my course and they lost settings on 3-4 multiple choice quiz tasks that I had already passed. Then after being 100% complete I called and asked where my certificate was and they said I needed to provide evidence of a White Card. Note: There was nothing in my outstanding tasks on the web portal that said you need to submit a white card.I had completed this training on line and after forwarding the email from the education provider confirming my attendance and passing the material. I was instructed by Open Colleges admin to print the certificate of attainment and physically take this to a GP to have it signed. The GP could not sign the printed document at face value, so I had to go home and take my laptop to the GP login to my email account, download the attachment in his presence and then he confirmed the print out was the same and signed.I then went home scanned this signed document attached this to an email and sent back to open colleges.Really stone age process that totally detracted from the course experience. The white card training needs to be integrated into Open Colleges or they need a partner they can trust and integrate with electronically.Still worth doing and would train with them again as the course was good, but yikes the pain of going through the above I can't rate higher."

5,2017-12-21T23:44:37.000Z,A great way to a new career.,Open Colleges was a great way to gain knowledge that relates so well to the workplace. I've had an extremely challenging year and they were very supportive. The trainers challenged me to try harder. They gave timely and encouraging feedback when I did well. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending.
2,2017-12-21T15:58:07.000Z,Not for the weak minded or willed. Very testing,"I am not going to lie about this course. It is very expensive and I find it to be very very poor in quality, support and outcome. I like to study long distance and have with other providers that were much better than Open Colleges. The course material is very poorly worded, laid out and is very hard to understand purely based on how rushed and sloppy it is. There are much easier ways to lay this course out and I was constantly frustrated with the way it was presented including spelling mistakes, wrong word usage etc. There is no ""staff"" support. You call the call centre and they read the question and then refer you to email your teachers. Who mind you, hardly ever reply. But the worst part? I had to find my own work placement and then have an Open Colleges assessor come to the placement. It was quite literally the most insane experience of my life. Firstly, the assessor was so unorganised getting back to me about a date. When he arrived he was rude to my work placement, and down right rude to me. He put me on show in front of my peers and I was humiliated. After he left, I had other work placement students say to me ""I am so glad I went through TAFE. Your course is a nightmare"". And yes I have passed but I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone with no experience in the industry, anyone with children or anyone that really requires help and support. A really bad waste of money and time. Sorry Open Colleges but you are not a good institution and I would not recommend you."

"" . This is frustrating particularly if you have waiting a couple of days for an answer.My expectation is the email is forwarded to the correct person to assist the student.Suggestion - Provide a list  In additional resources which contains the contact person for each subject  ."

4,2017-12-17T04:05:58.000Z,Learning with Open Colleges,Once I understood the learning online process and understanding how to self motivate and manage my units I found the process easy.More basic information at the beginning of the course re housekeeping like uploading of videos or audios and that I could move forward on another unit while waiting for feedback on a submitted one would have saved me time in the beginning.I enjoyed the course material and I learned skills that are relevant to the jobs I want to have and I would recommend this course and would look at Open Colleges for future learning.

5,2017-12-15T05:44:13.000Z,Honestly- I really enjoyed my time with Open Colleges,"I‚Äôve studied online in the past for university and so I am no stranger to online learning. I really loved learning here online through Open Colleges. The layout is so easy to use. Teachers are really responsive and willing to help. And students can call and staff are friendly and helpful on the phones. My only negative (which I think this is the same for all forms of education) is the price. But really, apart from that, 100% recommend studying with Open Colleges."
4,2017-12-13T10:26:43.000Z,Outstanding!,"This was my first ever course let alone course being undertaken online. I found my treatment and experience with my trainers outstanding.Easy, timely responses from both learning support and my trainers, making my overall experience very useful, and enjoyable.I'm actually starting a Cert IV with OpenColleges mere weeks after completing my Cert II.OpenColleges cares about each individual, and they're learning and achievements, overall outstanding!"
3,2017-12-13T08:42:35.000Z,Mixed review - good and bad perks,"Although my Open Colleges experience wasn‚Äôt as bad as others I‚Äôve heard, it still wasn‚Äôt great. Luckily I was already working full time in the industry that I studied, otherwise there is absolutely no way I could have completed this course.I found the marking was completely inconsistent and in some cases unfair. One assignment I got a credit for, though all the feedback said was ‚Äòfantastic answer‚Äô, ‚Äòwell researched answer‚Äô ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, etc. Then when I asked why I only got a credit, the response was ‚ÄòI give marks based on your answers. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing‚Äô. To me this is unacceptable, after paying as much money as I did for this course to be told that, and not how to improve. (Opilla)The work placement portfolios were beyond excessive, and the amount of signatures required is ridiculous. Lucky I work with a wonderful team that supported me with it, but for a poor student with not much experience working in a foreign service, this would have been awful to put the student through that. I haven‚Äôt seen the new portfolios so I hope that they have been updated in a more realistic way.Lyndal was amazing. She is one assessor that I honestly can‚Äôt thank enough, she really went above and beyond to help me. Thank you Lyndal.Rebecca was wonderful on her workplacement visit - she gave great advice and some cool new ideas and perspectives. Thank you Rebecca.Overall, my experience was average. I feel as though there isn‚Äôt a huge amount of support from Open Colleges, but it could have been worse. Maybe for future reference with future students, it might be nice if someone ‚Äòchecked in‚Äô with students every now and then to see how they‚Äôre travelling and if they need help with anything. I think this would help keep students motivated, as there were months at a time at times when I wouldn‚Äôt have any motivation to study. Whereas, perhaps if I‚Äôd had a message from an assessor or someone just to say ‚Äòhey how‚Äôs it going, is there anything you need assistance with‚Äô Etc. I understand it‚Äôs our own responsibility but it would be nice to feel like our assessors actually cared about us.Also, I was VERY disappointed with how my official certificate arrived in the mail. It was in a flimsy plastic sleeve, in which it has been sitting curled up in my mail box all day, so when I got home the certificate was all curled up. After slaving away studying at my computer for two years, working full time with two part time jobs at night and weekends, actually finishing this was so important to me and that certificate meant A LOT to me, to just have a bent, curled up one now that has creases in it. You could have at least put it on top of a piece of cardboard with a do not bend label on the envelope.Anyways - I am grateful and happy to be done. Towards the end staff were very helpful with getting my transcript and certificate posted out to name quickly as I had a diploma job offer at work and they needed my stuff ASAP, so thank you very much for that.Hopefully you can take what I‚Äôve said on board :)Thanks heaps, Bonnie"
5,2017-12-13T06:59:44.000Z,I love studying through Open Colleges!,I love studying through Open Colleges!!  Have studied through other institutions and find their support far superior and feedback on assessments very good. Would highly recommend them.
4,2017-12-13T06:25:30.000Z,Quality Information,I learnt so much in this course that I didn't expect to. It really opened my mind to the possibilities of improving the lives of others and also led me to look at ways in which my own life could improve. The course content was highly relevant and it's such a relief to be able to study without having to travel to a classroom at fixed times. Thanks Open Colleges!

All the assessors work close along side you and all assessor want you to succeed and do well, in all aspects of your work. The assessors and student support team are so amazing and caring towards there students. Their happy to support you at all times, I went through the loss of family members and personal medical issues throughout this time and the student support line is amazing, and have excellent contact hours. I would always call weekly with millions of questions or in a stressful confused situation over an assignment and they would always put me at ease and guide me in the correct direction. I would definitely study with them again after having such an amazing experience with open colleges through so many life's ups and downs, I still completed my diploma in the end!So thank you open colleges, kind regards Kayeleye Goddard"
1,2017-12-10T03:44:50.000Z,a laughable experience,"For your own sanity, don't study with open colleges. I did a cert 3 in early childhood education and care, and wished i had read reviews before being pushed into the course from there pushy sales people. I can only speak for the course i did, but everything about it was disorganised and the standards for a cert 3 were ridiculous, many people i spoke to doing the same course but as a diploma said that most of the things they were doing were exactly the same as the cert 3 work. The markers are terrible, half the time i would receive someone elses work back, or the feedback would be copied and pasted and not personalised at all. Some markers could not even write in proper english. Most of The student support team are rude when you have any troubles and send you away without a solution. It would take up to 2 weeks to get a reply back from the markers or anyone on openspace, if you got a reply at all. There is a lot more that i could write about open colleges but its not worth my energy, and i can tell you, its not worth yours either, FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
4,2017-12-08T22:59:44.000Z,Perfect for a self motivated learner,"Perfect for a self motivated learner, a bit of a wait time for marks but that's just because there are so many students and limited assessors. Extremely helpful assessors and student support."

However i wasn't able to find any and student support provided me with an alternative unit right away."
5,2017-12-08T03:35:14.000Z,Definitely recommend Open Colleges,"The staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.  The course was comprehensive and I felt that the course work and grading was fair.  Communication was professional and helpful.  I would not hesitate to recommend."

I also asked trainers to call me as i needed help with assignments and they wouldn't call me."

3,2017-12-05T08:49:17.000Z,Difficult but fulfilling,"I found it a little tricky organising work placement, feedback from the school was that something which should be quite simple turned into something difficult.  I also asked a number of times where the interview questions were and ended up being sent them after work placement was finished as I didn't actually have them.  It was quite difficult doing the electives not having a webinar and not knowing what was expected.It was a challenging and difficult course, but am relieved and feel a sense of achievement that it is finished, I certainly learnt a lot more than I knew before doing the course."
5,2017-12-05T08:10:55.000Z,Open Colleges are amazing,"Open Colleges are amazing, I have graduated my first course and look forward to enrolling in more in the new year. I definitely recommend OC to anyone and everyone as they will surely help you to follow your scholastic dreams.

Also try to expand your horizons and try something different. OC can open many doors to you.Cheers, Cazz. C M Holloway. 5/12/17"

2,2017-12-04T22:15:19.000Z,Things to improve,"There were many factors that contributed to my low satisfaction with the course.- the study materials are insufficient, especially those which are supposed to prepare students for practical tasks, like bed making, PPE or manual handling techniques. What we get is a set of videos from youtube, each one, from a different author, which are not very instructive and following them later in the preparation of the assessment results in a unsatisfactiory mark.- the questions in the assessments are very poorly formulated. They are obscure and imprecise, and this results in a lot of confusion and the necessity of contacting the assessor for a clarification. I suggest that the authors of the questions give them to be proofread by a student first before attaching them as a part of an assessment, to verify whether they are understandable,- the wait for the feedback on a assessment is way too long as very often it would be 10-14 days. This unabled me to be fully in control of how long I take to complete the course. Three assessors is just not enough to run a course with so many students. I'm sure that they are doing their best to help, but there really is a desperate need for more assessors."
3,2017-12-05T01:17:33.000Z,It was very challenging.,"It was very challenging.The tutor are very helpful, Holly was exceptional, but is not easy doing it on your own. The Course material wre not easy to go through.I took a tough risk,  but never ever again."
4,2017-12-04T03:10:04.000Z,CERT IV Bookkeeping,I really enjoyed doing this course. It was a bit challenging in parts and found that the assessors were quite helpful with the questions I had.It would be great though to get some sort of notification that assessments have been graded. I found I had to go in every day to check and it got a bit tedious.The support staff were very helpful as well. I would recommend others to give it a go.I'm now looking for the next course to do.Thanks for the experience
5,2017-12-04T02:19:22.000Z,Just completed!,"Studying with Open Colleges has been a rewarding experience, with the latest material, friendly help and support available and encouraging assessors. I have already made recommendations to friends."

Only heard from them  when getting a reminder course is nearly over or feedback from an assessment.I feel an email or message once a month from an assessor or trainer checking in could be encouraging and gives the student a chance to voice concerns or ask for help when they may normally just give up.The errors in the course notes also made it particularly difficult to understand what to do

2,2017-12-03T03:36:10.000Z,The course and assessments need to be updated regularly.,The course material took much longer to cover that the suggested time.The assessments need to be reworded  as they are difficult to understand what is required.  The  assessment also need dates to be reviewed as they refer to the incorrect years. The quizzes also need to be updated with current information regarding current Luxury Car Tax rates not rate from 2 years ago.
3,2017-12-03T02:16:29.000Z,Hugely dissapointed at mid-way grade changes,"I cannot fault the course content. I cannot fault the trainers. I also cannot give a 5 star rating due to my massive disappointment in changes to the grading system half-way through my course. To have my final assessment record show a consecutive run of high marks, to then the last eight showing 'Satisfactory', when I recieved HDs on ALL of those, in my feedback comments is, to be honest, disgraceful. I worked very hard to gain the highest marks I could, and deserved to have those HDs show on my final record. Grading changes should have been implemented from the beginning of NEW student's courses, not made inconsistent for those of us who were half-way through. Again, I cannot fault the trainers and course content."

3,2017-12-02T22:29:53.000Z,Average Scoring,I give 3 stars due mainly to the course and the material. Some of it didn't make sense most of the time even though there is a lot to take in i think some of the material was not necessary. The assessors were very helpful i must say and they were definitely there when needed and there feedback was always helpful. I have to give an average score mainly to the course itself. i think it needs to be reviewed and spelling errors to be corrected.
3,2017-12-01T03:42:25.000Z,Good for flexibility,"I chose to study with Open Colleges because of the flexibility (I work full time so needed to be able to study out of work hours and around life happenings). Open Space changed significantly (for the better) over the time I was doing my Diploma. All staff I spoke to were helpful and supportive. Webinars were useful for completing assignments however, some webinars were just the trainer reading out the information on slides which was not much more helpful than just reading the assignment/slide myself.My biggest pet peeves were: a) some of the additional resources were not correctly referenced in the related assignments. This meant I was unsure of whether I was using the right resource to complete my assignment. The alternative was messaging the trainer for confirmation, which leads me to my second pet peeve...b) I think the turn around time for responses to messages is two days. I know that's pretty standard, but with limited time to complete study, it was sometimes frustrating to have to wait two days to get an answer to a ""Yes/No"" question.Overall, it was pretty good."
3,2017-11-30T22:30:10.000Z,I had some negative experiences,"I had some negative experiences. Firstly after completing the first 2 subjects, the whole course was restructured and I had to start all over again.There were a couple of subjects that I felt had very little to do with what the course was about and seemed like ""padding'.Too many assignments required participation from another person, and it was extremely hard to pin down my busy husband to help.When I had finally completed the last assignment, it was verified that I had finished, but no certificate was forthcoming. Some unhelpful front line staff informed me that I still had 2 assignments to do, she refused to listen or put me through to someone who could help. As it turned out I didn't have any more to do, but I had to complain to one of the coordinators to get it sorted.On the positive side, the coordinators and assessors were knowledgeable and helpful. They gave detailed reviews of assessments.Overall the course material was relevant, and I am pleased to say that I already have got a lot of work in my chosen field."
4,2017-11-30T14:51:26.000Z,Overall,"Overall it was great & intriguing. There were technical difficulties - such as errors - with the website sometimes, but other than that, just fine."

All support staff, from tutors to administration were extremely helpful and supportive during the transition, and in helping me complete my Cert III in Education Support.  Highly recommend Open Colleges."

Omgoodness, Where did that time go ?. I‚Äôm happily married and a mother of 3 sons, so my life is eventful and full on . So I decided it‚Äôs time to take up what I started when I left school all so many moons ago . It was Working with children when I looked back over my reports , Early Childhood studies was where was I heading then but my parents had seperated, I was the oldest out 3 of siblings, my role was to support them. So my plans for the future were sidelined for a while . Quiet a while .I have been in retail fo 26 years so I decided this year it was time to make some changes and follow a different path . My goodness it was daunting to consider as I hadn‚Äôt been in school since two decades plus had passed .After I completed year 10 I headed straight into the world of retail, where I have had a long stint and been a successful Manager of many years  but It was time ..... the year of 2017 was to take a huge leap into the unknown and get back in the path I started so many years ago . Study.  With support of my family and friends I chose to study to be an Education Assistant . As I have 3 sons , I had the opportunity to successfully run a playground for 2 years in 15/16 at my local school . I loved it . My close friend at the time said to me , how amazing I was with children.  Now this is where Open Collleges came along . I knew about them as I had seen advertising online ,so I started  to read about studying to be an Education Assistant online  .It my mind ‚Äú No way I can do this !‚Äù but I typed in my details and sent for some information. I um and arghhhed after several emails and a phone calls but they were persistent for me not to give up my return to study  . Then one day in June 2017 , I rang and said Ok . Let‚Äôs do it. My start up support team where so supportive and understood my nervousness and reservations, They made me feel that I was capable and I would have support all the way.   .... I signed up , then fate decided to through a car accident at me the same week , ending up with whip lash and my car written off, no fault of mine  !!  I actually thought at this point that this was a sign to not continue or start with my studies .what was I thinking .??? But with guidance of my assessors . High five to Tim and many others. I was reminded I had time and I can do this,18 months actually ....It was hard to juggle a family , still work and continue on with my everyday crazy life with my sons now throw studying online in the mix !!  I was now in a study Abyss . I lost my husband for a while in my Craziness ( he was my rock ) ... but  the one thing I constantly had was the the support of Open College assessors , my family and friends . They believed it me . I really think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about .For me, I throw myself into things and give everything I have and get the job done no matter what it takes . I had many times of self doubt,frustration  even cried  thinking I‚Äôm in too deep but I was supported and talked through it everytime with professional support staff and assessors of Open Colleges. A phone call or email away .I smashed it through , in 5 months actually with great results, which is still a massive shock to me and freshly digesting .I made many mistakes along the way cried and laughed but still soldiered on . I was a night owl studying machine but with the guidance nothing was impossible to tackle or handle .Help is always there . My challenge was completed 29/11/17 . I have graduated as an Education Assistant and my new journey is just about to begin for 2018 . Thank you Open Colleges for having faith in me . I‚Äôve done it !! I fully recommend Open Colleges to leap yourself into your new career change or new study path  .. Thank you to all my Assessors . They taught me how to study again online .Forever grateful xx 10 stars"
4,2017-11-29T21:16:17.000Z,Studying Aged Care @ Open Colleges,"Studying Aged Care @ Open CollegesOverall the experience was a positive one; I had few difficulties navigating through the course materials and satisfactorily completing the assessment tasks.  I was fortunate in obtaining a work placement at a very good residential care facility.The main criticisms I would have concern the quality of the course materials and assessment tasks.* Some aspects of the material presented is repetitive in nature.* There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the material that need to be fixed.* Some of the assessment tasks are somewhat ambiguous and their wording could be improved.* In many cases the assessment rubics fail to provide any real assistance as to what exactly is expected in the task; many state that to attain a satisfactory the student must satisfactorily answer the question.  Specific details should be included to inform the student as to what is required for a satisfactory response.The support provided varies depending on who you get to talk to, with some staff particularly unhelpful.  The assistance provided with obtaining a work placement is limited.  In most cases, work places expect to be dealing with the college and the application process is more difficult without the assistance of the college.  Some work places will not even accept individual students.However, I found the standard of technical support to be good."

4,2017-11-27T00:36:31.000Z,Great foundation for further studies.,"Course material is generally up to date, well presented and engaging. I found some of the links have been lost and occasionally the solutions are incomplete or missing (IT issue). There have been some instances of lack of explanations for acronyms and worked examples - nothing some diligent independent proofreading can't fix.The trainers are helpful, if sometimes a little overloaded with work. For some reason the trainers often have issues accessing the course material you ask questions about, that is frustrating for both parties.The assessments are great learning experiences and at times pretty challenging. The assessors generally leave useful feedback, some are better than others (more comprehensive), and some are noticeably harder markers than others. The webinars are very helpful.The non-academic staff (when you ring up) are excellent.Overall I found the course good value for content and relevance. Proofreading the material will pick up the repeated paragraphs, spelling/contextual mistakes and missing bits and pieces, and at times it is obvious the material has been directly transferred from elsewhere and hasn't been modified and updated. I feel these issues are underestimated by Open Colleges in its negative impact upon an otherwise excellent course."
2,2017-11-26T23:12:02.000Z,Wouldn't study with OC in the future.,"I found OC to be extremely unorganised, the Assessments took over 5 days to be marked towards the end subjects, the Teachers sometimes took over the given 3-5 day mark to answer questions with some not responding at all.  The materials when printed out, missed out a lot of the content that is on the screen. Loads of spelling errors, missing information in the texts, assessments weren't specific enough where the Assessors would come back and say 'something more is needed' when you've answered all the questions in the assessment - it goes on.This may seem trivial but for all the hard work I put in and completed this course, I didn't even get to see the 100% completion graph on my profile.  It only went to 91% (as they changed some modules and assessments along the way) and I did not receive my Congratulations email like everyone else, which I was hoping for after the graph didn't change. Small things like that can make a world of difference to some people.The other students in the course on the other hand were fantastic.  Once I found the FB page and even created one for myself and some struggling students, there was a huge amount of  support towards each other where everyone lifted each other up which was a tremendous help seeing as there isn't enough support from the people at OC.  THAT is how I got the majority of this course completed.I wouldn't study through OC again."
2,2017-11-26T20:23:26.000Z,Inflexible study-at- home course.,"Firstly, the course material provided was very easy to understand and the Open Space website is great to use. Being able to download assignments quickly from the site is excellent. The assessors send back grades promptly with feedback.Now for the negative. Out of the 9 modules my course had I was required to do 6 audio/video components. This required me to either team up with an 'unknown' study buddy on the internet, or ask one of my family members or friends to do my assignment with me. I absolutely hated asking my family to help with MY assessments.  Most of my family are shy, and didn't want to be recorded, and my husband works away in the mines. What really frustrated me was when I called Open Colleges about this issue I had, they told me there's nothing they can do about it, I must get them done. I even offered to submit the scripts I had prepared as evidence of what was going to be said. They then said they needed proof that I am able to 'talk to someone'. I told them that I am already employed in a position which would requires this qualification, so clearly I can talk to people, I just needed to finish the course because I paid A LOT of money for it.  This didn't matter.I ended up finishing all my assessments, minus these components, within several months, but due to this difficulty, I put off completing my course up until 5 days before the course deadline. In the end, I asked my primary school aged daughter to help me out. The fact that she can't read with conversation fluency made it obvious we were reading. Even still, I was graded with a number of High Distinction. This just proves that it was really unnecessary to prove that I can 'talk to someone '.I think the fact that all my other assessments which were submitted, which didn't require an audio/ video recording, were graded very highly should've been enough evidence that I knew the course content very well and should've been excused from doing these recordings."

They say they will sort out the issue but 4 or 5 days later and I haven‚Äôt heard from anyone and because our study is time precious that puts a real burden on me to have to chase things up that I shouldn‚Äôt have to be doing.Finally I discovered on numerous occasions during the learning modules it says to refer to module 3.5.1 for example.. however as you open that part of the module you realise it has nothing to do with the topic your currently studying.. that needs reviewingThanks"
1,2017-11-24T05:30:19.000Z,Dont do it.,I did cert 3 health services assistance.Got assigned the whe wrong stream in the course and when I enquired about it they said there was only one stream but later on I learned that there were 2 and I did the wrong one but by that point I had finished. They keep saying they will call me back about it but dont.Every single assignment is a 100% pass mark. So your first attempt of every assignment is basically just to figure out what the questions mean. The questions are very vague and they want very specific answers.I had to make videos when I was assured there wouldnt be any requirement for that. If I had known what the course would be like I never wouldve spent $2273. I would have gone and done individual support at tafe which would have been so much quicker.I wanted to do this online to save time because the tafe courses were 6 months and I ended up taking 18 months. The last year I have also been a full time uni student and can honestly say the first year of biomedicine has been easier than this course.Even now I have the certificate I still regret ever signing up for this. I  wish i had read reveiws or joined the facebook group to ask if I should start the course.

3,2017-11-21T03:44:09.000Z,"Mixed review, but mainly disappointing level of admin support and communication","Positives: I found the feedback from the assessors very helpful, and they were supportive and constructive in their comments, but the negatives made the process, especially towards the end of the course, very stressful:- I finished two weeks ago, and Open Space is still showing that I am only 74% through the course, despite my having contacted student support.- For the unit(s) that had more than one part, it was unclear that each part had to be uploaded in a different section. When I uploaded all of my coursework in one place in error, I was not advised of my mistake. I only found out when I queried my status showing in Open Space a few months later- I did not receive any communication telling me that my maximum completion date was upcoming. I had this date in my calendar, but it was disappointing not to receive a reminder. I received an email the day after my completion date telling me it was a shame that I didn't complete, even though I had completed and have received notification of this from my assessor and from student support.- communication in general is not great and inconsistent- some of the information in the workbook is incorrect, and I was marked down because of it; this has been brought to Open Colleges' attention so hopefully will be resolved- many of the hyperlinks in the workbooks are out of date or don't work."

5,2017-11-21T01:55:09.000Z,Thankyou,Thankyou. It was a great course and I have learnt a lot. I was about ready to give up because of having to find work placement on my own but the support team at open colleges assisted and managed to secure work placement for me. I have now graduated and am ready to look for work.
3,2017-11-21T00:54:58.000Z,Communication needs work,"Communication with student support is not great, important information is not always communicated. All information relative to someone's studies should be given when a request is made and not after the fact.Trainers and assessors are wonderful cannot fault them in any way. They are informative, helpful and easy to work with at all times."
4,2017-11-21T00:36:37.000Z,The best way to work and learn at the same time.,"So far, the whole experience has been reasonably easy to navigate while I work full time, enjoy my life, and run my small business. Because you don't have set dates to hand in assignments you don't feel the pressure or the rush of a traditional school setting. My literal only problem has been that when you do have a question to ask, the 3 day turnaround can throw off your rhythm a little bit so you find yourself losing track on the odd occassion. Thankfully because the materials are in depth enough to avoid that most of the time it didn't cause me many problems. It's just nice to have a school experience where the school doesn't believe they should be the centre of your attention all the time at the expense of the rest of your life - unlike most traditional college settings."
2,2017-11-21T00:02:03.000Z,No good.,"The course content was hard to decipher, there was missing and inaccurate content. Uploading video assignments did not work as per the instructions. The tutors were helpful to rectify, but many hours were lost trying to fix the issue.The systems were down far too frequently.For a person who has very very minimal time to study, it needed to be readily available when I needed to study.I wouldn't recommend this to my friends and family."
4,2017-11-20T12:57:05.000Z,My experience over all was good,"My experience over all was good, however, during the period of my study, there were issues with Open space that hindered my advancing through the coursework in a timely manner.I also think that it would be helpful for students, if tutors could send a quick email acknowledging receipt of assessment pieces.Another point I would like to raise is regarding the purchase of additional periods of study: On two different occasions, when I paid for additional time, I was charged twice for my course extension. Each time the additional funds were refunded, however I am surprised that this error occurred at all. There needs to be better checking and communication between departments at the College.Thank you for your support while I was  student.I hope to return to undertake further study in the future, if you will accept my enrolment in the future.RegardsHelen Maree Barrett"

Working for 5 years straight after, going back to studying was the last thing on my mind. With some changes happening within my field of work I was placed in a position where I had to re-evaluate, what am I going to do now? Having a mortgage I really needed a place where I am able to still work fulltime until redundancy is given. I came across Open Colleges online and that was it. The whole experience was perfect. Angela called me when I enquired about Dental assisting3 and gave me all information I wanted to know along with course details and pricing. Everything being online besides the work placement part has been a breeze. Communicating with students and our trainers through Open Space is great. Everyone on there is there to help each other.

I asked a friend who is a nurse and her husband  who is a doctor to help me with them after I had failed them once and they also said they are very ambiguous. They and I felt a great deal of the material was to become a nurse, not a PCA or a Community Worker. I have worked as a PCA and a Disability Support Worker for 36 years and have never come across a lot of the material we were asked to learn. The student support team was fantastic. I enjoyed the course, but I feel a lot of it was ambiguous and irrelevant."
2,2017-11-20T20:38:51.000Z,A Mixed Bag,"Well, after that reply from Open Colleges I have to downgrade my review - it seems to me they've simply tried to 'talk-up' my review and avoid the issues I've raised. Well, guess that explains how they arrived at this poor situation? They still need to the learn lesson that any business has to set their customer's needs as top priority.The trainers and assessors were excellent - positive, supportive, friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. They were relatively prompt too. They are the ONLY reason I've given 3 stars - it would have been much less otherwise.The course content was 'thin' in some place and there were quite a few broken links throughout.The admin and technical staff were severely lacking - there was an ongoing issue with the site, which they were aware of, and no explanation or support for me - they never once returned a phone call to me when I had a problem and were not always cooperative and rarely proactive when I called them. They simply set up a clunky and unprofessional work-around to the problem."

1,2017-11-13T23:22:55.000Z,NEVER SIGN UP WITH THESE PEOPLE,"At the start everything seemed fine. Until my daughter got quite unwell and I had to cancel my course I informed never got a reply. So I called and he told me I needed to contact the special consideration team he was very lovely wished my daughter to get better and told me what I had to do and so on. So anyway I emailed them and that's when it all started. So I asked for it to be cancelled and be refunded from the time I stopped doing the course. They asked me to send documents which I did I had the proof for everything. Then they told me to keep resenting them pretending they didn't receive them. Then they made a decision to extend it 3 months and pause taking payments out. I told them I can't do this as my daughter was in and out of hospital appointments. I got no reply so I called the next day and supposedly the guy was sick. Then I kept calling and still wasn't in. Weeks went by and they still kept taking money out so my mum called and they said the guy was on holidays now. anyways so I kept seeing when he was back in and they literally ignored me. So then I said I'll be contacting the ombudsman and then they magically replied saying they cancelled the course and refunded partial of my money. I was intitled to 1,950 and I got refunded 750 :/ I called consumer affairs and they told me they couldn't do this they were only aloud to take a percentage which I already took out as I paid the fees at the start of enrolment and the month of February so all together 500. They told me to contact them and demand my full refund back or take them to VCAT. So I emailed them and there saying they'll give me an answer in 10 days which is such a joke when I've already waited 3 months. So 4 days in the 10 day wait and they still can't give me an answer. So if they don't my next Monday I'll be putting my documents to VCAT. It's bloody crap when you do everything they ask of you and it says it in there contract yet they try to find a reason to keep your money. They emailed once saying they were keeping fees because they send documents out it's an online course how can they send it to my address haha üòÇ hopefully gets sorted soon though as I'm so tired of it I'm already stressed as it is with my daughter."
3,2017-11-13T22:39:32.000Z,My course experience was ok,"My course experience was ok, I found it difficult not having face to face contact with the trainers and other students. Finding work placement was a challenge as many facilities have contracts with other training providers and hadn‚Äôt heard of open colleges. Some of the feed back from some assessors was unclear and waiting for a reply was sometimes inconvenient so finishing some assessments took longer to complete.The study buddy system didn‚Äôt work for me as you work at your own pace as do other people."

Why not send someone out to do a day watching the person at their work placement?Also, the assessments were ridiculously marked. I got them returned lots to add one or two things that gave me a high distinction. Why not just give me a distinction and not bother sending it back? I don‚Äôt need a HD to pass the course. Ridiculous.My assessor Stephanie was wonderful and she is the only reason I am giving 2 stars. Zero would be given if it weren‚Äôt for her."

2,2017-11-09T04:45:37.000Z,The education of their students is clearly not their main priority,"The admin support staff were polite but that's about where the good experience stops.Some course materials weren't very educational - often stating common sense instead of research based information.  Sometimes a quick google search would turn up direct quotes matching the learning material which were never sited in the learning material.  Some course materials had spelling mistakes and gramma errors making me question the editing process.Assessment questions were often worded poorly leaving students struggling to understand what the task actually was.Trainers and assessors would very rarely respond to questions regarding material or assessment.  When they did it was often to simply re-quote the assessment question back at you.I was forced to transition into an updated version of my program, but the way they chose to restructure the new program left students with next to no credit points to transfer and nothing to show for the previous study. Basically we were forced to start again.I would not recommend study with Open Colleges as the education of their students is clearly not their main priority."
1,2017-11-09T03:40:22.000Z,One of the worst experiences ive had ‚Ä¶,"One of the worst experiences ive had with studying. I received no support from the assessors. I would need to send multiple emails to get a response and the response would say something like ‚Äúread module X, X, X, X and X to get your answer‚Äù. What kind of help and support is that???! Also i had to re-do module 1 and 4 again once i‚Äôve already completed it without no warning to at least say ‚Äúdont do these modules yet as we will be updating the module on the xx/xx/xx‚Äù. Also if we have already done the module we shouldn‚Äôt have to be made to do it again, the students who havent complete the module yet should have to do the lastest one. This is really demotivating and discouraging especially when you are doing it part time. For re-submissions some assessors were great at telling and explaining where you have went wrong and how to fix it but others (Charmaine) just say everything that is wrong with it but not how to fix it, or will say ‚Äúi will send you this, and this to help you understand‚Äù but never sends it. She doesn‚Äôt explain anything clearly. I had to constantly call my prac cente to help me and this is not their job to do this. I was lucky and fortunate to have a prac centre as supportive as i did but others wont be as lucky as me. Most times when i was stuck I wouldn‚Äôt even message the assessor because they dont help, its like they are only employed to mark the assessments and the students are left to fend for themselves. I would not recommend this place to anyone."

Staff were very helpful and were prompt.Thanks to all managers and all open colleges staff, and I will  be recommending open colleges to all my family and friends because of the student support resources and helpful staff who really take the time with patience to understand weaknesses and provide support accordingly.Furthermore, I am deeply appreciative to all open colleges managers, staff and student support team especially to Melissa Nettle, Ruchi Makkar, Suellen Freeman, Angie Kasper, David Parasol, Lorraine Danos, Peter McClatchey and Joel Borwn.Honestly, you guys have done an amazing job!"

But staff were very helpful (when I got onto the right staff member who was willing to assess what was going on) and I was able to complete my studies. Assessors gave good feedback and Im overall happy with the course content. In the end staff did everything they could to see me finish my studies, I would recommend studying with Open Colleges."
3,2017-10-30T13:45:11.000Z,Flexibility,Next study period only opens after your previous study period assessments have been marked complete which after submitting take between 3-10 days for feedback. Does not allow for flexibility.

Quite often you are wanting to continue with an assessment and you may have to wait up to 4-5 days to get a reply to a question.  Have a look in the notes sections where people are asking questions.  Many are frustrated as their questions are not be answered.  Many of the links in the workbooks do not work.  This needs to be rectified.
4,2017-10-29T23:59:59.000Z,Course was challenging,"Course was challenging, but always got responses in a timely manner and found studying with open colleges really worked around my lifestyle. I was able to still work and be a mum, as there is no pressure to attend classes or have assignments in by certain dates."

Finished the entire course then after 6 weeks of no news, contacted to find out I was required to do a quiz  which was blamed on the transition, however I had finished this module by the time the transition occurred. Told it still had to be completed. I failed twice as I hadn't re read the notes - after all I was under the impression 3 years of hard work and study was finished 6 weeks earlier. It was a very unprofessional way for them to handle the situation. I am still very angry about the whole situation."
3,2017-10-27T03:36:40.000Z,Studying with Open Colleges definitely ‚Ä¶,Studying with Open Colleges definitely had its pro's and con's. At times it would take more than a week to receive results from assessors which was quite inconvenient especially when assessments followed on from the previous one. So I would end up not being able to study during that time as I was waiting on answers. Errors in the material were quite often found which made it hard to learn.

Being a mature age student & not having studied intensely for a long time, I was happy with the help I received when I needed advice, queries or guidance from trainers & support staff. I would recommend open colleges to anyone looking to further their studies or embarking  on a new career."
4,2017-10-25T03:27:07.000Z,Studying is fun!,"I have enjoyed my studying with open colleges I found it very easy to just log on and read the information then do the assignments.  The support that I got when I got it was great, it just took a bit of time to get a response but I do understand their are limitations that are unavoidable.I was so amazed and thankful to have such caring and helpful trainers throughout the journey (Lyndal especially!!!) it helped to take the stress off a lot!"

3,2017-10-24T08:16:13.000Z,3 stars but could really be 3.5,"I gave a 3 star review but could really be 3.5 stars. Overall I enjoyed my learning experience. The online framework had issues and it became more difficult to access course learning material - there was no real flexibility, you had to view the material in an internet browser. The support staff were really helpful over the phone. The facilitator was not contactable, I ended up calling the support team as they did not respond in a timely manner. Most assessors were easy to talk to and responded quickly. Some were certainly more engaging than others and gave useful feedback on assignments. I think for how much a student invests in a course, it would be nice to see updates with progress tracking. Two years is a long enough time to stray from the path and ultimately loose track of how much work there is. An automated email or even a phone call to touch base. Because the modules unlock as you complete them it is hard to gauge how long each section should/could take to complete. I think the majority of the course material was relevant and interesting. I really enjoyed the assignments."
4,2017-10-24T03:44:19.000Z,Overall Very Good,"I found that the course covered a variety of topics application to todays work force.  It took me out of my comfort zone and made me stand up and address my work colleges which is something I don't do.I found the information in the assessments scattered and in some places hidden.  eg.  One assessment was in the video assessment section.  I thought it was just to upload the video, but there was another assessment part there.Over very good."

The trainers and assessors were just great. No question was ever too silly or too hard. Their support and guidance was always appreciated."
4,2017-10-24T00:26:26.000Z,Overall pretty good.,"The course and trainers were very good and I‚Äôm a naturally motivated person so studying online is a suitable delivery system for me.  (I studied and graduated a HR degree online through USQ) Some of the issues I found with the course that could be improved in the future were:1. I prefer to print the study material, highlight and take notes. I often found that the material that was printed was, at times, significantly different to the online version.2. Some of the examples contained within the study material was not adequate to complete the assessments. Whilst it is fundamental to learning to to be able to conduct your own additional research, I still think it is necessary to be given more adequate examples within the course material.3. The timing taken by some trainers to answer queries was a bit long.4. Some assessment questions weren‚Äôt structured properly or were a little ambiguous so you had to ‚Äòguess‚Äô at the meaning of what was being asked.Overall the experience was good."
2,2017-10-23T23:08:44.000Z,C Grade teaching institution,"This course was sold to me as being self paced and that I could finish it in as little time as possible. Instead, after completing the first 6 modules, I discover they hadn't finished writing the curriculum and I was forced to wait an additional 3 months. This, coupled with their poorly worded questions which are there to ensure you fail your first attempt at any assessments (I can only assume this is to make it look like they're assisting you study), high staff turnover, poor communication and buggy online submissions, led to an all round terrible learning experience. Although I have since passed my studies this is in no way attributed to any help from Open Colleges and I will never enroll in any course offered by them again."
1,2017-10-23T06:56:27.000Z,The learning part +assignments was ‚Ä¶,"The learning part +assignments was pretty good.the reason I chose an online study was because I wanted it to be quick.The only thing that hold me back was Open College.I had to call more than 20 times, I had to chase people to check my assignments, I had to find out myself who is in charge of me, again and again.I'm still doing it.very unhappy."

I am hopeful that completing the course will make me a little bit more marketable and job ready."
4,2017-10-23T00:43:57.000Z,Online Diploma - the good and the not so good,"The good:  generally the material was engaging and relevant, and the turn-around on assignments was excellent.  I really enjoyed the course and would recommend to people who learn well using an online environment.  You will need to be self motivated but you've got more than enough time to complete the 8 modules within an 18 month period.The not so good:  The links contained in the material were often not working, and some of the material was a little dated and needed updating.  I was disappointed with the Certificate I received (it's pretty underwhelming) and the transcript that accompanied it.  I was expecting something a little flashier and a transcript that listed my grades across each module.Overall:  Recommend this as good value for an online Diploma."

4,2017-10-21T08:23:59.000Z,Great communication and very helpful.,"Great communication with all assessors and grading via open space. Very easy to navigate the site and prompt with all help I needed. Only, I found out about one assignment I had not completed, unaware to me, right at the end. Would have liked to be alerted of that sooner. I guess that's what online study is for, learning to be self responsible, I should have been more switched onto my status.Pretty happy otherwise."

2,2017-10-20T19:55:54.000Z,Diploma of Early Ed Course Review Open Colleges,"I found that a lot of the course material links did not work, so therefore had to research the material myself. I enrolled for a diploma course and the course books provided referred to cert 3 books, so again I had to purchase additional books to understand course material.I was also very disappointed to get to my last module and find that we were required to complete additional work placement with no reference to this prior.Some of the assignments were not relevant to the industry, and I write this honestly as I was fortunate enough to gain employment within the industry about half way through my course.I liked the aspect of online training and learning at your own pace with no deadlines for each module, but I wouldn't enrol in another course with them again.Some of the assessors were great and provided helpful feedback as I progressed but unfortunately there was one assessor who wouldn't clearly read my work and ask for resubmission even though my answers were originally there, which was extremely frustrating and time wasting.The course material changed throughout my study so I was required to redo modules even though I had passed. I was given the opportunity to either finish the course within 5 weeks or redo these modules. I think this was completely unrealistic and given that the reason the study material changed was due to legislation, the college would have been aware of this information a lot earlier."
5,2017-10-20T09:19:07.000Z,Great organisation to study with,"I was very impressed with the software for using the course material. For vet nursing, the trainers and assessor were amazing, marking assessments quickly and always giving great feedback."

It gave me a great deal of knowledge about the industry and it encouraged me to go further in writing as a career.The trainers were beyond excellent. They are skilled, knowledgeable and always available. They made the course very enjoyable. Major kudos to Annette and Nadine.The support from other areas of the college has been fantastic, helpful and accommodating.The course revealed my limitations. But it also showed me how to overcome those limitations and hopefully succeed in the writing industry.Love your work, live long and prosper."

I aslo found that that the open spaces site was useless, takes you 20 minutes to find the number to give them a call, didn't track my progress accurately and the size of documents allowed to be uploaded is often to small. Overall I did not enjoy my time studying with open colleges. I also found that the support that I got from my trainer was poor."
4,2017-10-19T06:49:26.000Z,I have learned the Certificate IV Project Management. I managed to obtain 'Top Marks'.,"I was learning Project Management. All of the teaching staff and with marking of assessments that I had written. Were all good and very helpful to get along with.I had serious surgery in both left and right of my eyes. My disability from retinal detachment and cataract surgery is taking over one year to recover correctly. I currently have much difficulty reading. Viewing two images closely overlapping both eyes at ~ 75 degrees.All of Open Colleges administration were very good to me with this area of my health and allowed my eyes lengthy healing time (study extension time) for this. Before I am healthy enough to begin again to complete all of my study to complete graduation.However, one day on weekend during September of year 2017 school holidays. I had difficulty explaining my disability and correcting this to obtain my correct information needed; relating to the College's web page Open Space\Grades. Which I found was confusing and difficult to read.  Both because I was trying to read this web page from my home PC screen, and ... From talking with a young female member of Student Open Learning staff by the telephone communication.Thank you all kindly."
3,2017-10-18T23:25:48.000Z,Overview of my experience,"Turn around time on the portfolio marking was too long. (2-4months initially) Often student support did not know how to help me when asking for extensions or to check if my work had been received. When I was asked by the course co-ordination to check my USI number with student support, student support said they could not check it and had no access to my number, even though I had given it to them before."
4,2017-10-18T21:30:46.000Z,Great,"The trainers were very helpful, however can proceed in markings quicker. Over all fantastic experience i will recommend Open Colleges."
1,2017-10-18T11:51:20.000Z,I am so disappointed,"I am so disappointed with Open Colleges. I re-enrolled in a course because family illness prevented me from completing it in 12 months the first time.On calling, the sales person promised I would not have to pay full price because I had previously completed the written assessments and that I would get a 25% discount if I paid in full. I paid through Zip Money, in full, but No discount ever received. So many promises and so much misinformation. I was hesitant in re-enrolling for a number of reasons but the sale person reassured me with the concerns I had. I later find out all of the information I received was incorrect. The assessments I'd completed were worth only 50% of each unit and because I had not done the practical component, I had apparently completed no units, therefore no discount in fees. At least they honored the grades for each assessment.I had so much difficulty finding work placement and Student Support was no support at all, I spent many fruitless hours emailing, phoning and visiting work places. 2 workplaces withdrew after they saw the amount of paperwork involved.The information provided on the Horticulture Course information page is incorrect.  It says you can follow Nursery, Parks and Gardens or Landscaping stream but there are not enough subjects offered to do this.The information page lists ""Operate basic machinery and equipment"", ""Lay paving"", ""Assist with landscape construction work"" as subjects offered in the course but they aren't even available. The problem is you don't find this out until you are enrolled (paid fees) and do your subject election form.I could not complete all practical assessments in one workplace because they covered different areas of horticulture. I could not complete all practical assessments in the 70 hour period of work placement (completed in one block as recommended) because certain information needed to be recorded over a 6 month period. This course IS NOT suitable for students who ARE NOT employed in the horticulture industry despite what Open Colleges says. I was doing this course so I could get a job in the industry. Now I wish I had gone to the local TAFE.I wish I could get my money back since I enrolled under false pretenses.I DO NOT RECOMMEND OPEN COLLEGES AT ALL."

Just overall unhappy with the money i paid to do this course not to mention they left out information when i signed up that I only just found out that I completed my course to be told i cant have my certificate until I paid the balance remaining which wasnt mentioned to me at all until I finished. Really disgusted and disappointed i wont ever recommended open colleges to anyone

For me it was overwhelming..I took too long asking for help , there were a lot of anxious times wondering whether I could really do this. I stumbled along and it wasn't until I wanted to throw it all in, i decided to ask for help. Then life has its challenges and I didn't think I could do both, but yet again sharing my experience with others gave me the get up to go. I then got a routine of home, work and study. It was then that I really got things moving.a great experience altogether. Just need to ask for help..."
2,2017-10-17T23:54:42.000Z,Go in with your eyes open!,"There were a number of errors in the course material.What they don't tell you is that if course requirements change when you are in progress of your studies you are required to do more work. This happened to me 3 times during my course duration. The result was that I did 6 modules initially that once a change came into effect were no longer counted as part of the course. This almost derailed my enthusiasm to complete as I lost all motivation. This happened again almost at the end of my course, when a module I had completed 2 years prior changed and I was required to do more work on the assessment, due to the change.There are system problems with uploading assessments. Once you upload them & get a confirmation of the upload the assessments drop off the system and there is no record of the initial upload. This happened a number of times.It's a wonder I completed my diploma, bit I did thankfully.  I was providing assistance from my course assessor, which I was very grateful for."
2,2017-10-17T13:15:50.000Z,Needs work,"I know it's a self paced online course, but some more structure or check in by the teachers would have been beneficial. The questions were very vague and communication with teachers by email was often days apart."

3,2017-10-16T22:59:33.000Z,Studying online is different ‚Ä¶,"Studying online is a different experience. You need to be very independent and confident when studying ultimately, alone. Support from Open Colleges is there if you need it, every time I rang or emailed Support I was guided in the right direction and felt confident each time I hung up the phone. The biggest disappointment I had with the experience was the time it took to mark my assessments and get my final report. There is a time frame in which this course needs to be completed and I‚Äôm just so thankful I completed it before my the course expired so all my work could be graded within the timeframe.Finding workplacement was also a challenge and once I found it I had to wait serval weeks for it to be approved by Open Colleges, meanwhile my course was still active and I needed to complete it within the 12 month time period I was allowed. This placed a lot of pressure and anxiety on me.All in all, Open Colleges was an okay experience, I would only recommend to others who are capable at autonomous learning."

I did a lot of extra research and reading to educate myself around these topics to then be able to study the course content and understand it, and then apply it. Perhaps all the people who are losing motivation and not completing the course are finding they can not understand the content and are not willing to do the extra research.So I feel prerequisite modules of science would help. When I suggested this to a trainer - I just got told to read my textbook."

This I realised when, at completion of the theory section of the course, I had to do placement. If the preparation for placement wasn't gpood, it would have been a daunting experience, especially  for someone like myself, comming from a non-related  career background. However, preparation was good and I found it easy to blend in and hold my own, confident in the theoretical knowledge I had gained during the course."

When I called Student Support at one point to find out why I had no response to an email, received a rude email from course co-coordinator basically telling me it was my own fault for not using Open Space. When I responded with further grievances and expressed my concern at the tone of her message, she had someone else respond on her behalf. Had several other instances of disorganised or poor communication from staff.Received assessment feedback stating I had provided information that wasn't correct. Checked resources and was no mention of said information. When I asked the lecturer where this information was, she told me ""it's just assumed you should know that.""Assessment materials are poorly formatted - spent more time changing reformatting tables and text sizing in templates than actually completing the assessment in some cases.Had to wait months for updated video resources on an assessment because the only version available was outdated and didn't contain information needed to complete current assessment.Had many other poor experiences during my enrollment with this RTO. Wouldn't recommend them at all."

1,2017-10-12T07:50:58.000Z,Not as advertised - no support - horrible staff,"I embarked on this course with high hopes. I quickly realised that the support I had been promised did not exist. The information on their website was so out of date. Trying to organize my placement was a nightmare! I was told that Open Colleges would support me in finding a placement, but when it came to it and I asked for help, they told me I had to approach 20 places and be denied before they would step in and help. So I did it myself. The information I was provided was all over the place. I had no idea what documents I needed as I couldn't find a comprehensive list, and none of the support staff could tell me either. I was just transferred on the phone and given different email addresses which took days to reply. When ever I asked for support from an assessor I was met with condescending remarks. I was disappointed when I completed my placement following the instructions on one document, but at the end I was told that there was a different document with new instructions that I had not followed so I had to complete extra work after my placement. I was anxious that this would make me look bad in the eyes of the staff at my placement (where I was hoping to get a job) but after I explained all the difficulty I had been experiencing with Open Colleges, and a quick look at some online reviews they were quite understanding.No one from Open Colleges has ever called or emailed to offer any support. Often if you call the student support number you sit on hold for an unbelievably long time.Many of the assignments in my course do not come with clear instructions. If I get stuck on a question I'll look in the student coversation section relating to that assignment. I'll see that many students have been getting stuck on the exact same question over a course of months or years because the wording needs to be changed or the question needs to be made clearer, but the assessors post rude and condescending replies to students instead of changing the questions.This has been an absolute waste of my time and money. I would not recommend Open Colleges to anyone."
5,2017-10-12T06:51:46.000Z,I would have preferred a classroom ‚Ä¶,"I would have preferred a classroom environment to study, but as this seemed my only option, as online studying go it was an easy process once I had navigated and mastered my way on the website. Communication was often slow with assessors if I had questions."
5,2017-10-12T04:56:31.000Z,education support,I have completed my certificate 3 in education support and found open colleges very supportive and great to work with.

I am  very grateful that I have the chance to Graduate my Diploma of Accounting through Open Colleges.  Also, highly appreciated Open Colleges team for their support when I needed it.Thank you Open Colleges."
1,2017-10-11T23:38:39.000Z,SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND NO SUPPORT,"I put a complaint in half way through my study due to one of their trainers illegally sharing my information without my permission. I showed the evidence to which they thoroughly denied it and renewed my course as a 'sorry'. By that point i decided i wouldn't study with them and pulled out. i didn't want to risk them giving my personal information to anyone else. Before they were giving out my security details, there was little support for help, no constructive feedback. It almost felt like you were pestering them when asking why something hadn't been marked when it was sent off 2 weeks ago (they say only 3 business days) The company is a con, read the reviews before you loose your money and potentially put your security at risk. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."
4,2017-10-11T21:11:33.000Z,Was a good experience and it is very ‚Ä¶,"Was a good experience and it is very flexible to my lifestyle.Didn‚Äôt like the video assignments, felt a bit intrusive asking people to be filmed and then posted on the internet to share to a total stranger behind a screen.Overall, was a very good experience."
5,2017-10-11T01:01:47.000Z,Fantastic experience,"Fantastic experience! The content of the course was fantastic, easy to understand, well structured and supported by great webinars, videos and case studies. I was able to complete this course while studying full time, and was able to use my work experience to complete my assessments both theory and oral. The online portal made studying online simple, easy to navigate and stress free. The trainers and support staff were always available to help. Would recommend this course to everyone. Project Management is applicable across industry."
5,2017-10-11T00:25:52.000Z,Best online course provider,Easy to use online systems. The assessors also very approachable and communicate on time and give feedback.
3,2017-10-10T23:41:52.000Z,Open Colleges Review,The video assignments were a nightmare to upload and get marked. It was difficult to find the contact phone number for student support or the email address.It was very disappointing to see that the marking time frame had changed from 3 business days to 5 and yet there was no communication to students regarding this change.It was very slow to get modules unlocked and I had to contact student support multiple times. When I completed all the assignments the status of my course didn‚Äôt read 100% and the completion email wasn‚Äôt sent to me until after I contact student support to confirm I had completed everything necessary.Being able to study at my own pace in my own time was excellent but difficult to find placement being an online course.
4,2017-10-10T21:31:17.000Z,I would like to thank all the staff at ‚Ä¶,"I would like to thank all the staff at open colleges, it has been a delight being able to study through you and when in doubt my trainers were there to push me in the right direction. I enjoyed studying through this course with the highs and the lows and the OMG I can't do this but kept on going."
5,2017-10-10T21:05:35.000Z,Fantastic support,Great subjects and friendly tutors. They regularly reach out to offer assistance. So glad I did my course with them!
5,2017-10-10T02:28:03.000Z,very good Experience,I found the whole experience from start to finish very easy to understandand follow . when i needed student support they were great . Good feedback from my assessors with relevant recommendations .

5,2017-10-09T03:29:09.000Z,Diploma of Project Management,"Course was great, everything I expected. On line tutorials were a great way to study, better than wading through tomes of text. Assessors provided comprehensive, timely feedback which was excellent support. Admin and student support was also excellent."
5,2017-10-09T01:26:27.000Z,Reflection,"Open colleges has helped me develop my knowledge in the area of Youth work. It has open my mind up to different areas that I will be working in and knowing how to deal with different situations. It has been a valuable experience and the support with open colleges has been nothing but amazing. Being qualified feels amazing and now I will be able to put what I have learnt into action with work and feel so much more confident.Thank you for everything, I am very grateful"
2,2017-10-08T22:29:20.000Z,Pretty Average,"While some of the staff are helpful, others would not care less about the quality of work you do. When you bring an issue up of lack of support they simply tell you there is plenty and not where to find it. Many students struggle finding work placement as most clinics do not want to deal with OC and have stated so (because OC expects too much from both the clinic and the student), but again when this issue is brought up, we are told it's not true. Overall it can be good for people who learn via reading along with no explanation (as you would expect from an online course), but the support they say they provide is pretty much non-existent. They are not consistent in their markings for grades (I have passed with HD, while others who almost have word for word have failed). The workbooks are outdated and you will use google for all your information."
3,2017-10-08T21:43:56.000Z,Learning material is great,"Learning material is great, marking period could be improved a bit, workplace hours part of the course is too much. log book and assessments are ok but then having follow up phone calls that go through the same things as the assessments and workplace activities is just beyond ridiculous. felt like course was never going to end."
5,2017-10-08T04:22:29.000Z,Open Colleges Perfect for Online Education,"Open Colleges was an extremely positive experience, from the course itself to the facilitators and  assessors. Communication was prompt, assignments were assessed and feedback given within 3 days allowing for continued momentum . I would highly recommend OpennColleges for online education- at no point was I disappointed. Professional from beginning to end."
5,2017-10-07T01:55:53.000Z,Completed my course and such an amazing feeling,It was really good that I could study whenever I could and when I was stuck with few problems on assignment there were lot of support from assessors. Definetly recommend to anyone that would like to study online :)this course was very challenging but with amazing support it made it possible
3,2017-10-06T21:25:59.000Z,No support in finding a workplace,No support in finding a workplace. Assessors didnt know if i was completing version a or b. Assessments took too long to be marked and i had to extend my course twice!Overall I'm not even excited about completing my course as everything just dragged out too long.
2,2017-10-06T09:52:52.000Z,only if i have no other choice,"Constant tech difficulties causing delays in marking assignments, access to course material etc and lack of support from trainers eg: 'I can't tell you if that's correct but you are on the right track '. This feedback was NOT helpful or supportive to the question asked.As head office is based in Sydney staff had little (or incorrect) advice when discussing interstate requirements.Most admin staff were helpful and courteous even when things went wrong ( Which seemed often). The smoothest part of the whole thing was the direct debit company (Which is outsourced) as i had to change accounts a few times and they did it without fuss or error.If you decide to take on an 18 month course aim to have it completed in under 16 months as it will take 2+ months for the behind the scenes things to be done and then another 2+ weeks for your certificate to arrive in the post."
5,2017-10-06T04:47:38.000Z,Amazing,Amazing. Staff and course was well set out.
3,2017-10-05T09:52:20.000Z,The quality of study material needs ‚Ä¶,"The quality of study material needs improving.  Quality of layout at the start was far superior to what was received towards end of course.  Some sections had too much content and some had too little.  Answers to all activities should be provided within written material so student can check their learning progress as this service is not offered by trainers.  Learning material changes too frequently.  Having separate PDFs for each chapter within one study module makes hard to electronically search material for answers, and study functions.  Suggest going back to one PDF per study module.  Several mistakes in study material, and found a lot of information repeated over the course."

3,2017-10-03T22:32:46.000Z,My journey has been tougher than I ‚Ä¶,My journey has been tougher than I expected. I chose the program because I was pregnant and need something to do after I gave birth. Because of health reasons I stopped working earlier than I have planned  which made it difficult to  pay my fee. The other people from debt collectors even called me whilst I was in labor to discuss money that I didn't have which was heart breaking. Two days after I gave birth I called open colleges the first I talked to was so mean. You don't plan to be sick and not able to pay your Debt. We didn't understand each other with this first person so I was referred to this lovely lady who made my payment journey easier and less stressful. The study support team were really good they helped me to finish my course. I just received my certificate yesterday. And got offered a good discount which I was able to pay with my little savings .i haven't worked for more than two years and a half because of health reasons.Thank you all the good staff from Open College and to those terrible ones you need to improve sickness can affect anyone at any time and you will struggle to make live a normal life because of stress
2,2017-10-03T22:17:16.000Z,Disappointing course!,"Course material was poorly written, lots of errors. Some tutors helpful, other not so. Management were rude and not willing to help with getting issues fixed.I would not do another course with Open Colleges as it was not a pleasant experience, which was disappointing!"
3,2017-10-03T10:09:30.000Z,Poor quality course,"The course material in ""Illustration and Drawing Made Easy"" is clearly very old, and the quality of images in the PDF document is poor.The best thing about the course is that it got me to put in the practice to do the assignments, and it's good to get feedback from the course assessor for each assignment. I'm pleased with my improvement over the duration of the course.I cannot emphasize enough that the course material needs updating and needs to be better quality. It was not worth paying $1300 for it. I found much more useful instruction for free on YouTube as well as through free online learning courses."

3,2017-10-03T07:15:28.000Z,I had an overall pretty good experience ‚Ä¶,"I had an overall pretty good experience doing my course through open colleges, however i did have to ask for a month extension TWICE, due to the fact that the markers having such a high marking load and therefore it did take a long tie for them to get back to me with results and therefore i did have to ask for these extensions. I also waited close to 3 weeks for an assessment that was never coming as the assessor had spelt y name wrong when sending my result through and therefore i never got it until i emailed them a few time. Other then that open colleges support call staff have been wonderful and i would recommend then to family and friends"
5,2017-10-03T02:43:11.000Z,A rewarding experience,Open Colleges has an excellent online learning platform. The course material is relevant and up to date. I felt so supported by the assessors / trainers they are beautiful caring people who genuinely want the best for their students learning. A great experience! Thank you

3,2017-10-02T00:26:20.000Z,What I did like - as above,What I did like:  I did have good support and my tutors got back to me in a timely manner with the answers I required in order to continue with my studies.What I struggled with:  I did not enjoy completing the audio/video component of my assessments regularly.  I had already shown my skills in interacting and leading meetings and felt that doing these role play situations were not developing my skills in any way.  I know that the teachers said it was required so that I understand the topic thoroughly but it had already been shown in the assessments I had already completed in each topic.  EG having a meeting about payroll did not show that I was capable of processing payroll as I had already demonstrated this in the 1st assessment.I found this component of the course frustrating also given that I was not in an environment where I could utilise work staff to complete these role plays.  I had to write scripts for my 14 and 12 year old sons so that they could act out the scenarios.I found I spent a lot of time converting files etc so that my lecturers could access my audio/video files which was also frustrating
4,2017-10-01T23:05:54.000Z,I found this course to be thorough and ‚Ä¶,"I found this course to be thorough and set out easily in terms of learning and information.  Probably for me, I found it a little difficult in terms of connecting with the trainer as sometimes it took a few days for an email to be answered. Not all the time, but I think to get maximum out of this course it is best to hook up with a study buddy which I did not do.The facebook page helped with connecting with fellow students.I have recommended this course to people I know"
4,2017-10-01T20:43:45.000Z,Great experience,"The modules were useful and relevant as well as the assessments, I wish there were more practical assessments than theoretical. The time in responding to questions should improve, to be honest, but overall the time I spent during my studies in Open Colleges was worth enough to improve my knowledge and skills in Business Administration. I would definitely recommend this to my friends."
4,2017-10-01T10:05:40.000Z,Overall it was good,"Overall it was good, assessors need to all consistently give feedback. There were a few links that now do not exist. Accessors need to respond to messages and view comments on open space, as there were messages from people studying that were not being answered."

4,2017-09-29T01:30:19.000Z,Editing and proofreading course,I really enjoyed the course I took with Open Colleges. The tutor was supportive and answered questions comprehensively. I worked through the course material at my own pace. I prefer to study alone but the offer of study buddies or discussion boards was always available.Would definitely recommend taking a course through Open Colleges.

Although it provided me with the information I needed to complete the certification it did not provide enough personal support to aid me when needed and was slow when reporting back on assignments. If I were to do this certification again I would choose a company who was able to have trainers come out and work with me, or have in person classes available to develop my skills"

I have had a number of different contacts throughout my time doing this course. The only teacher that I would say gave me excellent advice would be Monica. She is amazing. As for everyone else I wouldn't recommend this course or online business to anyone. I have advised my HR department not to put anyone forward for this again.

5,2017-09-27T02:58:35.000Z,10/10 Studying with Open Colleges.,"Highly recommend studying with Open Colleges. Everyone from trainers, assessors, and support staff go out of their way to help you understand the course material, help with assessments, and motivate and set goals to complete your course. There is also great support from fellow students in the forums and options for study buddies. So convenient when you can't commit to going to a regular class everyday, you can study in your own time."

I would recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to get back into the work force after being a parent at home or just a change in direction. Really worthwhile !!"
3,2017-09-26T07:53:35.000Z,Just a waste of money,"Open Colleges is a well recognised Training Institution although I've seen a big dropped down in the student support and management since the ownership of the OC has changed. It seems to me like now OC is trying to get more students ($$$) but do not care about the individuals and how they go with their studies once they are enrolled.* If You write to your Trainers, they replay back to you after 3-5 days when you could have really progress with your assessments in that time instead of waiting for the message back. Most of the times when I asked a question I wasn't getting the straight answer - the answers were more like my questions just written differently and not clear for me at all.* Also when You submit the assessment, the next module should be opened automatically, not that you have to write to your coordinator and wait 3 days till it's gonna be unlocked or calling the OC Support and spend 30 min on the line-time is crucial for everyone those days.* The assessments itself have lots of mistakes and spelling errors. Sometimes You don't even know what are they asking/what they want form you to completed.* Feedback's from the assessors look more like a ""copy & paste""  spreadsheet than a feedback to understand the mistakes you've done in the assessment. Also they are not consistent - one of the assessor gives you a HD for your written report, then the other one only D as an ""Executive Summery"" was missing in your report (It was missing in the first 4 that I submitted as well and no one even commented on it).* The amount of emails not addressed to me/my study about opening new units, expiry of the course or changes to study structure was just insane. Same when You call the Student Support - one person says A the other one says B and at the end you are soo confused and have to write an email to them anyway and again wait another 4 days to get the answer.Overall my experience with Open Colleges is below average! I'm happy that I finished it and that I don't have to deal with it anymore."

If there is anything that I could point out,  would be the response time to questions asked to Trainers on Open space - it would be great to see a quicker response.Overall I appreciate the support and co-operation and would happily recommend Open Colleges to anyone who is looking to start a new career or build their career and receive a professional qualification."

I got quite sick and was able to defer for 6 months, with no hesitations from Open Colleges.I am quite impatient so waiting 3-5 days for assessments to be marked or for questions to be answered,  was difficult. The course content constantly gets updated which is great, however no extra time is added when more assessments are added. I also had great assssors and made a life long friend from a study buddy."
2,2017-09-25T11:57:26.000Z,review,"At the start of my 3year course the support was terrible, i would message an open collges trainer a question about the assessment i was doing and they would sometimes take up to a week to respond! When time is crucial thats a long time to leave a student hanging! The support did get better and more frequent  in the last year or so of doing my certificate.The marking did take quite a while.Wouldnt study through opencolleges again and i wouldnt recomend to anyone wanting to study."
4,2017-09-23T06:20:36.000Z,Loved studying with open colleges,"Loved studying with open colleges only thing that could be improved is the time it takes for assessments to get graded.  Great format, knowledgeable content. Would now like to get  employment in my chosen field."

2,2017-09-23T03:06:45.000Z,Very disappointing overall,"Very disappointing overall. Only two people in the whole organisation made an effort, one person in student support who helped get my RPL through even though I had been contacting support for help for 5 months, and my assessor Paolo who helped greatly. I had to extend and pay for an extra 6 months because of wrong information and a dreadful lack of general support and communication. The assessments were very difficult to upload and took a long time to get marked, which then delayed the next modules start. I  am not a good witness in referring this organisation just by the stress people have witnessed in me getting this course done."

4,2017-09-22T06:08:32.000Z,Pretty Decent,"For the most part, it was pretty decent. Feedback from Trainers was helpful. In this case, even more so because feedback is very important in anything design related (I did a design course). The website could use a bit of work in terms of navigation. Having to go back to the main course page just to see your other assessments is a bit of a hassle. Over time I got used to it. Although the course I did was a small one, it was pretty informative and did give me a basic insight into what it would be like in the industry. Support Services over the phone were pretty amazing as well. Shout-out to Mr Matral (enrollment consultant), David (from Support Services) and the Trainers."
5,2017-09-22T04:31:39.000Z,Thanks Open Colleges,"I have just completed my cert 3 in childhood education with open colleges, and would highly recommend them. I am an older student so studying was not an easy thing to deal with especially with 4 kids and having not a lot of computer experience  open colleges have been great, very supportive and understanding, offering very useful advice and help when needed. Quick to respond to emails and messages. A great college that want you to succeed and are there every step of the way. Thanks to Open Colleges I am now employed as a Teachers Aide and loving it. Couldn't have done it without the support of the college."

1,2017-09-21T02:03:59.000Z,"A disappointing, disorganised experience","Overall, I was not pleased with my Open Colleges experience. The learning resources were outdated, there were spelling errors and the assessments were often quite unrelated to the learning tasks. As an educator myself, I am aware that assessments are an extension of learning, however in this case, I found myself having to Google the majority of my answers as the learning materials did not cover it. You should not be tested on material that you know nothing about - that is not the purpose of assessments.I also spoke to quite a rude person for my follow up question call. This was at the start of the course when I was excited and ready to get started. The person I talked to was disinterested and distracted and I felt as though I was a burden for him. It was very disappointing.Finding a placement was VERY difficult. I was living in Sydney at the time which you would think has hundreds of options. No. No one would take students. I felt like I had paid a lot of money and Open Colleges was not helping. Their process for ""helping"" you find a placement was more difficult than finding a placement yourself. They did not make it easy to seek help. I felt like I handed over $2500 upfront and received outdated online materials and no help to get placement.I also found the processes of this course quite arduous and disorganised - especially the placement phone interview. The phone interview was supposed to take place half way through my placement (when the knowledge is fresh in your mind), however due to whatever disorganised reason, mine did not happen until months later. To make things worse, my interview was scheduled for 5pm one afternoon and I waited by my phone for an hour and received no call. I then emailed my interviewer to find out she must not have put it in her diary, or there was some kind of glitch.Additonally, on this phone call I was informed that I had completed all necessary components and I could await my certificate. I waited a few months and heard nothing, so I called Open Colleges. Apparently I hadn't submitted my Logbook? I meticulously followed the uploading instructions for the assignment and according to their instructions I had completed everything. Why is there nothing in place that alerts you that there is a necessary component missing from your assignment? What would have happened if I didn't call to check on the whereabouts of my certificate? Would my course time frame have run out and then been deemed incomplete and unsuccessful?For a college that prides themselves on being the best, I am not impressed. I will not be recommending Open Colleges to others. To anyone reading this, find an alternate college."

1,2017-09-19T23:54:05.000Z,Dodgy,"*** edit***The response shown from Open Colleges below falsley states that they have resolved the issues through Special Considerations. This is untrue as i have not applied for a remedy under special considerations and no resolve has been made for my consumer law breach complaints. The remedy Open Colleges offers is that I have been constantly pursuaded to keep the course i have paid for that i am trying to cancel and refund through consumer protection laws. The response below is yet another example of deception from Open Colleges.Choose a better quality course provider - i am having to go through so much hassle trying to cancel and be refunded due to ONGOING AND MULTIPLE admin errors, service failures and to be honest low quality course content.Definitely take into consideration:-pushy sales people using pursuasion techniques and even calling multiple times to seek to enroll you asap.-Multiple spelling errors and inconsistencies in course-embarrassingly dodgy youtube videos used to deliver learning content-quiz errors-course changes that mean you need to start over without gaining academic credit for work completed (because courses are not up to scratch to government regulations)-unreasonable and ""scammy"" contracts-unwillingness to adhere to consumer law and follow their own policy and procedure-unethical, immoral and money-hungry- definitely prioritising profit over student learningI really want people to learn that although there are some reviews of open colleges being decent, they are a for-profit company that have lost most legitimacy from major flaws and errors, dodgy operations,  low quality content, and even predatory sales techniques and the inability to rectify issues. Their main concern is to lock you into a contract. If you want to be taken seriously in your career - choose somone else."

3,2017-09-17T22:57:55.000Z,Feedback and review open colleges and vet nursing,"The only negative feedback I have about open colleges is there's no standardised marking between assessors and IT problems take days to resolve. Otherwise my overall experience was good, finding placement for vet nursing was a nightmare so if you're studying vet nursing be aware of this. To improve, I think there should be a student body of some sort to advocate for students, if there is already one in place, can you make it easy to find."

I found that the units and the assignments were very focused on what i was wanting to study and the feedback was always timely and informative. Placement was very rewarding as I did mine in Fiji and was able to put skills into practice in a very meaningful and rewarding manner I would like to thank all my trainer Livingston and all those who assessed my work as well as Rosan and Travis for the training and invaluable feedback during my time. overall it was a great experience.

The website was often slow to respond, slow to open."

I also know that I will be continuing more studies with Open Colleges."

Issues involved the reading material with errors in regards to missing references and some scanned in material was unreadable. Query's on the scanned material were left unaddressed. History reading material would be more beneficial if delivered electronically via video link or DVD. Overall, course was good, but took much longer than expected to complete assignments.

Maybe one section at a time as there is a lot of work to do.The interview questions throughout the placement was helpful as there was time to ask questions and generally talk about any concerns during this time. It was nice to finally hear a voice at the other end of the phone as not much communication during the course and had to wait up to 4-5 days for a reply from an Assessor.Im a first time student on line so was a bit of a learning experience and felt a bit lost sometimes.Overall I enjoyed studying and am glad it have done it as I'm employed in the Allied Health field already!Thanks!"
1,2017-09-13T01:43:12.000Z,When I first enrolled in my Cert111 ‚Ä¶,"When I first enrolled in my Cert111 Aged Care I was told I would get RPL credit for the 6 out of the 14 units I had already studied with TAFE QLD, however, when I sent in the evidence I was told that the course had now changed to cert 111 in individual Support and I would not get any credit for the units I had completed. They offered to reslove the issue and I requested financial credit that I would have received for the units I had completed. I received under $300, not happy. I considered withdrawing but knew I would not get my money back as I had paid up front in full expecting the credit to be returned.When I started my placement I had sent the forms on to the placement organisation and thought I had done all necessary steps so began my placement, when I submitted my first assignment  I was told that my placement had not been authorized. This created a lot of stress for me as I was half way through the placement and was told I would have to start again. The college did allow me to continue the placement once and i did not have to repeat it.I submitted an assignment in May and it was marked satisfactory in May, in July the same assignment was marked as being submitted incorrectly. Apparently they changed the way the assignments were to be submitted in June after the assignment was submitted. An assignment submitted on 18 July was finally marked on 28 August.The college was always very slow to return calls and often had to be called again to get a result. I found the whole experience stressful and at time wondered if I would ever get my certificate.Would not recommend Open Colleges to anyone."

3,2017-09-12T04:06:06.000Z,My Open College experience,"Enrollment was an easy process and the payment plan option worked well for me. I give my 3 stars based on the course content which is excellent and in depth, although the assessments were sometimes difficult to understand due to questions that made no sense or criteria that wasn't listed. At times i felt as though it was set up that way to make me struggle. Some assessors were very helpful and for that i am thankful, others were not so helpful. The workplace learning was lengthy and a very stressful experience for me. At times i felt like i had to jump through a lot of unnecessary hoops. I would recommend starting work placement at the beginning of the course because there is a lot of waiting for interview appointments and assessments to be marked. Unfortunately i would not recommend anyone studying with open colleges. I am thankful and proud to have completed my course now, with little support, but i will never study through them again."

For me though, I felt like I had to wait too long to get responses from my assessor's/trainers for assistance with my assessments. I also felt that during my elective the webinar's where very poor, not enough examples where given, and it felt like I was being read my assessment questions. When receiving feedback from completed assessments a lot of the time I didn't understand what they were asking of me that I could of done better.

2,2017-08-27T01:55:47.000Z,Glad its over!,"Trainers were helpful HOWEVER, mistakes in course material, material that did not adequately prepare for assessments and assessments being poorley worded created a frustrating learning  experience. Feedback on assessments was often lacking, simplistic & not constructive to further learning. The BAS component should have had webinars to explain this area more fully. This was by far the worse area of study in terms of preparation for the assessment and learning how to analyze reports to recognize/rectify errors. Trainers did their best to get me through, but alot of questions remain unanswered/ unexplained.The course material and assessments seem designed to prolong the ability to acheive completion in the time frame.I acheived great results, but I have some experience. I would not recommend this course to any newcomers to bookkeeping especially...nor others looking to gain this qualification. This is not an area of study conducive to online learning...."
3,2017-08-27T01:47:45.000Z,Communication and support,"I found the lack of communication with any trainers, unless a question was asked was a bit of a problem. If it was a face to face course, the tutor would be having constant contact with the students. I would get into a rut and there was no support from anyone. Just left on my own. Perhaps a fortnightly contact with students could be implemented to keep students interested and supported.  Suggestions from tutors if students are having problems to get motivated again. I found the need to photograph family a big issue as I don't have family nearby. Many people, particularly older people, don't have family available to photography.The interviews in each section I found the background very distracting. Nothing to do with a photography course. The interviews in the early sections, taken in an office,  with the completely blown out distracting background was not a good  advertisement of how to take indoor photos. ""Always check the background"" is what is being taught, but the tutors are not following that 'rule'.Module 2 seems to be the level most people are getting stuck on. Perhaps a review of this section to make it more interesting would keep students interested in the subject.With lots of visual, voice communications available now, this could be a form of communication and support for students.Pintrest needs to be divided into smaller boards. One for the current students to post to. Not with thousand of images displayed and not being able to follow or find your images on the board."

Some areas did not make a whole lot of sense due to how they were worded, however I was able to jump on Google and research the matter as a back up.Having said that, the assessors were always available to help and thankyou very much to Open Colleges!Ryan"

Without your constant contact it would not have been possible. You are truly a great asset to Open Colleges and I hope they reward you appropriately.To say I am on cloud nine is an understatement. I am so ecstatic that I have finally graduated and cannot wait to receive my certificate. It will take a few weeks to unwind from the ongoing stress I am sure, but I am so looking forward to a relaxed life once more.Please accept a huge thank you from me for helping me to achieve the first item on my ""bucket list"". I wish and your new family well in the future.PS: I am almost sorry to have finished as I feel a hole in my life, but I am sure it will be filled by something equally challenging soon :-)"

I wish I could say that the transition went smoothly, but I had to take initiative for every step on the way. I also had to complain several times because I was getting mixed messages from different staff members. I was very confused about the requirements and I kept getting wrong information. The transfer might have played a huge role here so I can't really say what kind of experience I would have had had I started with Open Colleges in the first place.However, I was impressed by the promptness of their response and by the fact that every issue that came up was dealt with very quickly. I would probably choose this college again if I wanted to continue studying but I would be prepared to take more initiative and ask for clarification more frequently (and possibly ask more staff members the same question) to be sure that the information that I was getting was correct."
4,2017-08-25T04:12:37.000Z,Great flexibility,"Great flexibilityIt was great to be able to complete my course at my own pace, in my own home.

Tutors well helpful and majority of assessment was marked within the 3 days.  Not sure how you award a grade for certificate course (kind of goes against the competent or not yet competent).  Overall I was happy with my course.

I have contacted them multiple times asking for a form to be sent to me so I can request for an extension as I have had a baby. I asked for the extention 2 months before my due date. My baby is now 6 months old. Every 2 weeks I call or email them and each time the staff have said they will send me the form. They never have. Also you need to keep paying them during this time period they don't stop payments they just give you an extra 6 months on your finish date.... that's if you can even apply for the extension as their service is horrid.

2,2017-08-21T23:08:01.000Z,Better off through TAFE very unsupportive and money hungry,From the get go the salesman on the phone put pressure on me to sign up immediately for 2 certificates I only was interested in 1. The cooling off period was much too short and locked you into a contract I would've gotten out of had I known how difficult and unsupportive my experience was going to be. It took about a month to get my workplacement approved wasting my time and took a long time 1 month between assessments to get marked for workplace portfolio and logbook and then final phone interview to completing. Responses from staff were sometimes a week or more apart and had to be chased up. I am not looking forward to my next Cert based on this experience and am unfortunately locked into their contract for it otherwise I would go through TAFE.They are quick to chase you on payments though so you can see the priority for them. A student I did placement with had further money taken out of her account each time they attempted to take money out even though she called them and told them to wait until the next day to take the money out.Felt very hindered in my study and unsupported.

2,2017-08-19T00:07:59.000Z,The graphic design pathway program.,"The online portal has been down, has caused problems, and some issues have not been taken seriously when reported.The ""pathway"" program for graphic design consists of pointing students at the internet and telling them to learn the software themselves, using publicly available videos and online tutorials. You don't need to sign up and pay up to $8000 for that. Hoping it gets better and some actual teaching occurs as I've only been enrolled for a month. On the plus side, assessors have responded quickly and student support are always available."
2,2017-08-18T01:34:32.000Z,Improvement,"HII can understand the course is very new to the market, I don't believe the course was looked into before publication due to the many mistakes and level of inconsistencies.Throughout certain stages of the course you are dealing with different trainers, I personally think this is a flaw. I found the different trainers had different levels of assistance. One trainer in particular wasn't very helpful, she was but wasn't.As far as customer service goes it would be nice to talk to a trainer and not have to wait a couple of hours for feedback. I also think the 3 day policy for feedback is appaulling as well, although I do understand the trainers are busy.Overall the course through OC was very stressing, I loved the course itself but having to deal with OC was terrible. YES the course needs improvement."

The online student portal was inaccessible for days at a time. One particular trainer seemed more interested in what her personal life than helping out students and was often unable to answer questions in an intelligent way. There was no evidence of 'industry experts' and the whole thing was a shambles from beginning to end. OC seemed more interested in making sure students opions were quashed than apologising and sorting out problems honourably."
3,2017-08-14T23:51:11.000Z,Not too bad but not great either!,"I haven't had the best experience studying with open colleges, some of the assessors and trainers take forever to reply to messages, which isn't good enough when I've needed help with my work. Apart from that the content is easy to read and understand, and the fact that I was able to extend my course was a big help for me. Probably won't study with open colleges again."

Generally they are quick to respond too.My friction is with the admin side.  I have just today completed all required units for my double certificate course and my opening page says I still have 14 assessments to complete.  I have been fighting for this to be corrected for a year and a half.  It is very unmotivating. I have also had to fight for recognition of units completed.  When the course changed, I was told I had not completed two units when I had.  I have email confirmations to confirm my completion, but nothing ever changes on my page.  I have sent a message today to ask for confirmation that both courses are done as I won't rest easy until I have that proof."
1,2017-08-14T12:40:09.000Z,terrible experiance,"I started a course Allied Health Assistant course in Occupational Therapy in January 2016. I first experience was actually very good. The people were nice and when I was calling up to ask for the enrollment the lady on the phone told me that the course is discounted. Of course I thought that this is a great opportunity and I enrolled myself in the course. I was very luck and fortunate that I could study full time for about 4 month and I went quickly though to the course. But in the beginning of May I received an email, saying that the course I am currently doing will be changed and that everything I have done (all of my assessments and time I invested) will be not recognized- these are government changes and open colleges is very sorry about the inconvenience.After a couple of phone calls, tears and frustration, I had to start the course from zero again. My motivation was very low and it was hard for me to start again. However I picked up my mojo towards the end of the year and was completing the course within a few month (I have to say that the current course is better structured and easier than the old course). However, for the course I also had to complete an internship to complete this course. I was looking for an internship since January 2016 and had contacted around 25 different organisation but no one wanted to take an student from open collages on (most are just taking UNI students). I was calling several time open collages and was asking for help finding a place, but it took them until April this year to actually get in touch with me to help me finding a work placement. That meant for me that I was stuck with a 97% finished course for over 5 month and no one from open colleges was interested in helping me. I felt very sad about the treatment from open colleges and would personally never do a course with them again.It is now August and I finally finished my course. I couldn't be more happier that this nightmare of studies is over and I can continue having a normal live with out open collages.I also want to mention that my work placement assessor was very supportive, lovely and nice. I am very glad that she guided me though the work placement. Thank you"

Resident fell on top of me and I was injured. Unsupervised, no OH&S training within the workplace and funnily no documentation about the incident! Open Colleges' workplace coordinator told me that she did not want to hear from me until after the placement had ended. Where was the support so desperately required? Felt so inadequate and unprepared for work experience and it was a toxic environment so zero support all round."
3,2017-08-14T08:13:56.000Z,Certificate IV in Professional Writing and Editing,"I felt that the professional writing and editing course could have contained more practice in editing and proof-reading - maybe been  given pieces of writing to edit and proof-read. As someone who was coming to this course with a view to learning more about professional (ie workplace) documentation I felt that the course focussed more on writing for social media. That in itself is fine if that's where you are aiming, but it possibly should have been more apparent in the blurb about the course. There were some issues with communication with tutors. At one stage an email enquiry was not answered and only by chasing it up with another tutor was I advised that the first tutor no longer worked with Open Colleges. Overall, I did learn a few things, but I don't feel that it was great value for the money spent by my employer."

This was only minor because I got to redo the question anyway. Thoroughly enjoyed it otherwise, heres to the rest of my life. Thank you, Open Colleges for this opportunity."

I found that the staff lacked the necessary support required for an online course. On numerous occasions I have contacted ""Student Support"" and been told they will get back to me.. however it has taken a week or more and many follow up phone calls on my end.I didn't find the trainers overly helpful.. one enquiry took me over 2 months to follow up and even then I didn't get an appropriate answer. That's over 2 months of waiting to get assistance with an assessment.. and you can't move on to the next unit until you complete the previous assessment.Overall a very stressful experience. I thought it would be fantastic given the flexibility... but really that is the only bonus. Wouldn't recommend studying through Open Colleges."

I found that the caliber of assessor plays a major role in this. Lindsay was great, prompt in responding, detailed answers and answered my question.I would have liked to of seen other methods to learn. For example, I love flash cards. These would help me to remember definitions ect to a deeper level than what I currently have. Even a 'cheat sheet', a page with a summary of each topic I can keep in my bag and look over. This stuff especially would be handy right now as I'm applying for jobs and freaking out about interviews! These could be included in the additional resources."

3,2017-08-07T10:20:27.000Z,Certificate IV Bookkeeping,"I honestly thought that the experience of online learning would prove a lot better than what OpenColleges provided. I struggled a lot with the many mistakes in my learning materials and assessments, the confusion and glitches on the website, and while my assessors and trainers were happy to reply to my inquiries, I never really got a direct answer, and that left a lot of students, myself included, ready to quit with frustration.Having said that, however, I have learned a lot and I think that even though it has been a struggle for the past 2.5 years, it's still been worth it, learning perseverance in getting through difficult issues, and understanding more of what is required when I get stuff wrong. And learning to ask the right question to get the answer I need!But I am sorry to say that I will not be highly recommending OpenColleges to anyone who would want to professionally study a course in bookkeeping."

I had a couple of technical difficulties which is a given when completing an entire course online. The staff were all amazing and very helpful.
4,2017-08-05T08:30:26.000Z,I found the coursework very easy to ‚Ä¶,"I found the coursework very easy to follow with a wide range of academic content from many informed people. For the price it was very helpful for my writing, and the feedback from Rob Stephenson, my trainer, was incredibly encouraging. He genuinely cared about my career as a writer outside of the course, oftentimes including extra information packages from outside the curriculum for me to study alongside my assessment notes.Will definitely recommend Open Colleges to friends and keep it in mind for future studies."
4,2017-08-04T12:36:04.000Z,Good choice for independent and self-sufficient learners,"If you are an independent and self-sufficient learner like I am, you will enjoy studying with OC. I completed Cert IV in HR and I did it within 1 year (Instead of given 18 months). As a professional who works full-time, has family commitments and other community responsibilities, I found it extremely convenient to be able to download study material and assignments to study while on a train. All my assignment were graded within a promised time frame of 3 days. It was a bit inconvenient not to get notifications once an assignment grade is received and I had to download feedbacks to be able to read them. Also, student engagement facilitation can be improved for students who may like to get some motivation from outside. It was good though that our trainer set up a FB page where they regularly post relevant updates on the industry.Overall, it was a decent experience and I do recommend to study with OC if you are a person with good organisational, time planning, and investigation/search skills. But if you are the one who needs ""in-class learning"" under a constant trainer's eye, then sorry, you should shop somewhere else."

The change of curriculum two months in was extremely frustrating and I found the content of the course to be more of a medical assistant course rather than on OT assistant course.  I felt completely unprepared and lost going into workplacement.  The only positive was the support from Supervisor, Renee during the workplacement."

I found it hard to deal with the assessors who always had an excuse to fail your assessments or add extra work for you to do that wasn't actually specified in the question or criteria. Videos were hard to get done and were essentally pointless as you had to mark it off at work placement anyway. I did not find this course enjoyable due to these reasons. The assessors and the videos.

If I needed help with anything, the support team were always friendly and quick to respond. Navigating from one area to another within the program was easy as well.The trainers are very patient and helpful."

Course materials were out of date, links in these materials and online assessments did not work, your online platform is horrific to navigate through, you get no responses from trainers when you contact them through Open Spaces so are forced to call the Student Support helpline to get a ""real person"" to contact you, you are not equipped to deal with ""non-standard"" students (as in I did not do the course in the order of studies and had multiple RPLs which seemed to be an issue for you), received incorrect information and different answers to the same questions.  I would never recommend anyone study through Open Colleges.  You're quick to sign students up and take their money, but then disappear and are unhelpful."

In relation to the course I found some modules with a lot of repetitive questions being used in the  assessment tasks. At times some of the questions were not clear in response to what was actually been asked and had to have some things clarified a few times before I could proceed. On the quiz assessments it would be nice to know what the answers are to the questions that you get wrong. You do found out if you have to take the quiz again but if you pass and still get a couple wrong it would be great to find out what the answers were.  It was a great course to do and I would recommend it to anyone."

4,2017-08-01T00:03:18.000Z,Need more Assessors to alleviate their work load,I feel that the feedback could be better and quicker.  Sadly the teachers and assessors are very overworked which makes me feel they are very much understaffed to enable quick turnaround.  When you have a three day turnaround or more for questions your time is very much encroached upon when you only have a certain amount to complete the course and this can become rather frustrating at times.  They also need to update their email system as this inhibits communication.  Material needs to also be proof read as their are mistakes that can also take time to work out that it is not your fault and this also delays time.  If these areas are looked into the College would be a wonderful resource for many persons that work and study as many of the students do not have the access to go to University because of committments and TIME is of the essence.
1,2017-07-31T09:10:20.000Z,I joined open colleges to study a ‚Ä¶ diploma of youth work,"I joined open colleges to study a diploma in youth work. I opted for a payment plan at the beginning as I have a family with 2 kids and times are tough! Anyway fast forward 9 months I have completed my diploma which is awesome! But open colleges won't provide me with my diploma because I am on a payment plan and I still have a balance owing. Yes I signed the agreement and the student handbook, but no one verbally told me I wouldn't recover my diploma until the balance is zero.This is ridiculous anyone who completes study understands the instant gratification you receive when you complete study.If I would have been verbally told about not receiving the diploma until paid off- there is no way in the world I would have chosen this organisation.On the flip side my teachers were great."

Being a less popular course, this wasn't a major surprise.The trainers were extremely helpful, addressing the above concerns promptly.The trainers made it worth going with this provider, down to earth knowledgeable real people.Admin was smooth, only once or twice did it take more than a few days to get a response, but that's because the enquiry was inter-departmental.All in all, a thorough course with good variety and professional trainers."
4,2017-07-29T23:48:45.000Z,Positive experience.,I had a very good experience with Open Colleges. The majority of the trainers I dealt with were very helpful and replied to my questions very quickly. I loved the forums as could get info from other learners too. I had a few bad experiences with Student Suppprt where I was getting conflicting information whenever I called about a particular enquiry which was very frustrating but got sorted in the end. I really enjoyed doing the course and would definitely consider doing another course with Open Colleges in the future.

It was a most worthwhile course to have undertaken and has given me the confidence to seek out and apply for editing and proofreading jobs.
1,2017-07-27T05:29:57.000Z,Disappointed,"Well presented learning site and easy to use.They didn't handle Governement transitioned courses well. Student support was good though they missed that I was lacking an elective so I didn't graduate when I should have- even though I sought clarity from them for 3 months. I also made an official complaint which was resolved well at first, but they also didn't pick up on the missing elective, even when I asked them to give me a clear list of what I needed to do to Graduate. Very disappointed that my graduation and subsequent University degree enrolement was put into jeopardy because of their lack of organisational processes which has put a mark on my whole experience with them. Nil compensation for their mistakes."

Julie Miller is an amazing trainer and her interaction and support couldn't be matched. A fantastic experience all the way.

It was my first time doing an online course, although self study proved challenging at first, but it suited me best, being a mum. All trainers and support staff were always swift to provide assistance.  I was also impressed with the course layout. I feel very gratified on being able to complete this course and having had entered and learnt about a totally new field. I have already recommended Open Colleges to some of my friends and will continue to do so. Thank you all at Open Colleges making this possible for me!"
1,2017-07-20T00:42:13.000Z,I do not recommend this company!,"I would never recommend this course to anyone. I completed my diploma in early childhood education and care after many mix ups from the assessors.They added more course material without telling me and after the assessor told me there was no other requirements.The assessors took weeks to reply even to simple questions and mark assessments.They were extremely rude, unsupportive and unhelpful when they eventually did get back to me and it made it very difficult to complete my requirements.Not only was it the assessors but the actual course material for work placement was beyond rediculous! My placement staff also could not believe what was expected of us and them! It made it hard to actually observe and experience everyday practices with the amount of activities we had to complete and which weren't practical at all!Not only was this course completely reliable on yourself without help from ""trainers"", the requirements are triple compared to others I know studying at an institute.I had raised my concerns with program managers and student support without a suitable resolution.I am glad I have now completed my diploma as it was an awfully stressful time in my life which should have been made easier with the promised support and guidance of the assessors."
2,2017-07-19T22:38:54.000Z,Frustrating to deal with.,When I needed the support Open Colleges was very frustrating to communicate with. Would not recommend to a friend. Wasn't worth the headache!
2,2017-07-19T03:46:22.000Z,Graphic Design Pathway - a path through hell and back,"I enrolled in the Graphic Design Pathways program before the transition to the new course, so I don't know if everything is still the same, but some of my complaints are unlikely to have been addressed by the new course.The entire course was structured around peer-to-peer learning and review. Sounds good on paper, but it was frequently the blind leading the blind. I lost count of the number of terrible designs I saw from fellow students, who then gave truly unhelpful feedback to their peers (you should do this terrible thing instead; I like this terrible thing), with no constructive input from trainers at all. In fact, there was no guidance from the trainers until our assessments were submitted, by which point it was too late to address fundamental flaws in learning. Trainers really should not be called trainers if they aren't going to train.The PDFs we received instead of guidance from trainers were riddled with typos and broken links to missing references - at one point (at least) you misspelt Learning; how telling. More importantly, though, countless links to videos and articles explaining things the trainers should have been explaining themselves, links to material that was meant to clarify and expand on the PDFs, were broken, lost to the ravages and reinventions of time on the internet. And no substitute links were provided to replace them  I get that constantly checking and updating the PDFs was beyond the capability of this institution which ""teaches"" its students how to research and how to use InDesign to make interactive PDFs, but a running tally on the forum for each module with alternate links to similar materials should not have been that difficult and should not have to be suggested by students after the fact.And this horrifying lack of proofing was not limited to the PDFs - the assessments themselves were also riddled with typos, missing words, and terribly vague language to the point where it often seemed like the assessment had been run through Google Translate four or five times. More horrifically, there was a question on at least one of the multiple choice quizzes whose official answer was thoroughly and obviously incorrect, this was raised by a student to the trainer, and the response was along the lines of ""meh, too expensive to fix it"". What kind of attitude is that to have?! I paid $8000 for this course, as did everyone else, and all of the material we received was thoroughly out of date, and no one on your side of the forum wall seems to care!Speaking of the forum, good god how ineffective a tool were you looking to build? Replies to posts are meant to generate notifications so that the original poster knows someone has looked at their stuff. But no. No notifications for any post on any forum for any study period. And again, this is a course that relies on peer-to-peer learning, which demands feedback be sought and received and considered and integrated into or rejected from a final design. It's one thing to have to manually track your own posts on forums based on where you're up to, but your replies to other students that they might then reply back to (or not) asking for further clarification or feedback on a new iteration of their design... Those disappear forever! And if there's going to be a set limit on how big a preview image can be, make it an inherent limit in the forum! The number of times I couldn't load a thread because my internet connection couldn't handle the number of high res preview images other students had posted at full size despite the clear and consistent guidelines was staggering! At the end of a billing cycle I frequently just had to give up on study because I couldn't even check to see if anyone had bothered to provide feedback on my work. And I barely ever received feedback from other students anyway, and from trainers almost never, so it was always a futile process. Thank god I was finally directed to a Facebook group by another student, a group of students actually interested in providing feedback as much as receiving it, because without that group there is no way I could have made it through all the stress and anxiety this course heaped upon me, and I guarantee that that's a common feeling.As a side note, I wasn't directly affected by the transition into the new course because I finished everything just before the deadline, but the number of other students I saw in the Facebook group talking about all the mismanagement and conflicting information they had received regarding the transition was... Honestly, by that stage, it was just typical Open Colleges ineptitude. I get that there probably wasn't a lot of information on your end because it was a government mandated process that was partially out of your control, but from our end it was just a shitstorm of misinformation. And that's when people were actually told about the transition - I only found out because of discussions on the Facebook group, I never received any kind of notice from Open Colleges. Though I can't say I'm surprised when you continued to enroll students in the old course who would have no way of completing the course before transition time, despite you continually saying you had no idea how credits would work between the two.Speaking of the new course, when I applied for an extension earlier this year due to mental health issues, it was granted in theory, but in practice my enrollment was discontinued in the old course and I was enrolled anew in the new course with no credit for the with I had already done. I had applied for the extension because of stress and anxiety; this debacle did not help my situation.So yeah. Terrible infrastructure, terribly managed, loads of misinformation... Given all of this, I think you'll agree that two stars is actually an incredibly generous review. The only reason it isn't a single star is that the description uses the word rude, and no one from OC was ever rude to me (though some of the feedback I received for some of my assessments are definitely patronising). Let there be no mistake in this, though: I wouldn't dare recommend the course or the company to anyone, ever."
5,2017-07-17T23:46:58.000Z,I thoroughly enjoyed the course,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, much more content than I could have imagined.

I would recommend this course without hesitation to anyone with an interest in photography. Regards"

The course was challenging without a doubt but after completion of each subject module, I found I was driven to continue until I reached the end.  A huge personal achievement!"

The range of assignments kept me interested and the feedback from the trainers was timely and detailed. Although I would have liked to have more training in the programs used to create designs (e.g. Photoshop and InDesign) the course itself made me learn them. In a couple of years (or one) I will probably come back and study at Open Colleges again.

1,2017-07-16T12:11:07.000Z,Very disappointing,"Terribly organised coursework and communication. I ended up only having access to the old, no longer valid coursework which I only discovered after I contacted Open Colleges. At this stage I was at least 12 months into my course, and Open Colleges told me I'd have to start the new coursework from the beginning, with no credit given for the assessments which I had already completed, even though they had not given me any access to the new coursework. After some pleading, I was kindly given an extra month as compensation for the 12 months I'd lost as a result of their error.The coursework, quizzes and assessment material contain spelling and grammar mistakes throughout. Incorrect worked examples and quiz questions, which the tutors/trainers are aware of, yet still do not remove nor notify students about. Tutors are usually responsive to messages, however they give advice such as ""don't bother with the extra readings"", ""don't worry about doing the 'Check Your Progress' questions or extra activities"" etc. I'm sad to say, but I would not recommend Open Colleges to anyone"
4,2017-07-15T01:22:02.000Z,Mostly positive experience,"I have had a mostly positive experience during my time at Open Colleges. The content was informative but i struggled to understand some modules even after reading the workbooks and had to use google. Forvthe price we pay it would have been nice to have the option to have printed copies mailed to us.The staff were fantastic and were happy to provide assistance.I would love to see some video training sessions for some modules to better set students up for their assessments, particularly for application based modules.Openspace has definitely improved but is not perfect. The graph that shows how far i am wasn't updated during the website transition. It is better than some of the other online providers out there. Response times from trainers and assessors was very quick.Overall i enjoyed my time at Open Colleges and I would recommend people check it out."
4,2017-07-15T01:03:50.000Z,Very good course,"My studies with Open Colleges were fabulous and highly recommended for people who are too busy for on campus study.I liked studying at my own pace, easy access to learning materials and assessments, and thought provoking learning materials.The assessors were great! Always respond quickly,and grading done quickly. However when asking for assistance, would be good if had telephone capability, sometimes after back and forth messages, still not sure on some things.Overall am very satisfied."

I would recommend this to anyone looking to work and study at the same time, however.... I would not recommend this to someone of an extroverted nature as the lack of face-to-face interaction was a little bit of a buzzkill. But still a terrific learning system."

Some  of the modules seemed very repetitive and were extremely boring whilst other modules were fascinating and very well written.  Open space  is atrocious, not user friendly and full of bugs. There were many spelling mistakes throughout the course notes and two errors which have since been fixed in the quizzes. I did learn a lot and enjoyed many of the projects.  Pleased to have finished in six months."
1,2017-07-13T05:12:59.000Z,DO NOT STUDY WITH OPEN COLLEGES,"I cannot express enough how bad this provider is! After a seemingly lovely conversation with my course advisor I happily signed up with a positive outlook on furthering my education. After reading through my first workbook (which had multiple spelling and grammar errors), I submitted my assignment only to get a 'Withheld' mark and vague feedback telling me I had failed everything. After trying to depict the feedback for quite some time, I had no choice but to email the trainer and re-ask exactly what was needed, turns out I didn't fail every qu estion, I just had to fix up two things and ended up with a HD.It has since been noted that the spelling and grammar errors were not confined to that first workbook, it is throughout all my workbooks and assignments and the vague responses to my questions regarding their awkwardly worded assignment questions are just as poor across all trainers.And to top it all off, I only signed up with them because I was assured that I could defer my course for free while I travelled Europe for three months by my lovely course advisor, only to be told that this was not the case.Once again, DO NOT CHOOSE TO STUDY WITH OPEN COLLEGES! It is not even worth the one star I had to give it on this review or the money I spent on this course."

Since starting, i did recieve support, up until our trainer became ill and then my messages and emails were not returned and were going unanswered.Apart from the lack of support during this course, the work load and the information provided was great but then i was up to work placement and the electives and then it just went from bad to worse. The work load with the electives, logbook and portfolio is just beyond ridiculous, So ridiculous that even the director at the centre i did my placement at was laughing and saying it was so much for a cert 3. Im at the point in the course where im considering stopping and asking open colleges for RPL and transferring to a different organisation. However i just found out from another student that that wont be happening cause she went to do the same and they didnt give her transcripts.. so jokes on me, Open Colleges just got $3000 from me. Claps for you!I would never recommend OC to anyone."
2,2017-07-12T08:01:03.000Z,My review,"I chose Open Colleges to study my Cert 3 in Early Childhood because it was online and flexible. However I was also promised lots of support which I feel I didn't receive.When enrolling I asked about work placement and Open Colleges made work placement sound like a walk in the park. However I was expected to find and organise my own work placement. Not only did I have to log 120 hours, I also had to complete a massive work placement portfolio. It was huge and very overwhelming. I tried ringing Open Colleges for support but was told to email my trainer to make a time to speak over the phone. My trainer was not available for another 2 weeks. I was also required to get a lot of evidence and signatures from the supervisors at work placement which wasn't always easy. Lucky for me, my work placement were very understanding however other students haven't been so lucky.During my study our trainer fell ill and ended up leaving. I felt Open Colleges wasn't honest with the students with what was happening. Our messages and posts to the forum were going unanswered.I also got minimal feedback on many of my assessments- sometimes it felt like the marker hadn't even read my assessment, suggesting I write things that I had already written.Open Colleges aren't always easy to deal with and sometimes it is hard to know what they expect. One example is the First Aid certificate we are required to get on our own. It was unclear if we were meant to upload it like other assessments or email it. Once I finally worked out who to email it to, I found out it actually needed to be verified by a JP first and then emailed. I'm not a mind reader.Open Space- the online portal is not very user friendly. It is incredibly slow and frustrating.Due to the lack of support I received from Open Colleges and how isolated I felt, I created a facebook study group. This group now has about 200 members. We have been able to support and encourage each other. It is so sad to hear of other students who have had change of circumstances but are still locked into paying for a course.My cert 3 was very involved and I learnt a lot. I have also begun my dream job in the Early Childhood industry and am loving it. I have Open Colleges to thank for that.Open Colleges are great if you're happy to motivate yourself to study and do it at your own pace- online. However if you are requiring a little more support I recommend you look at other options too."

4,2017-07-11T10:27:32.000Z,Great study platform,"Great study platform, study materials are great but sometimes outdated. Overall services are good .I managed to finish my course in 2 years even though I didn't have accounting background when I enrolled. I saw some students struggles  alot with minimum help from trainer/assessors.It would be much more better if open college services timely and fast reply to students when question ask for help."
5,2017-07-11T07:17:54.000Z,The Best Option,Being a part-time working mum with both children in primary school this was the best option for me to become qualified in my chosen career. They were very understanding when things were not going as expected in life and allowed me extra time to complete my course. The course has made me so much more confident in my chosen field. I would recommend open colleges to anyone.

1,2017-07-11T03:12:50.000Z,I would not recommend this institution,"I would not recommend this institution. They came in a great deal cheaper than TAFE, which sparked my initial decision to enrol. However, the course was structured poorly, grammatical mistakes throughout assignments lead to many misunderstandings, which were hard to clarify with the lack of assistance. All correspondence was email based, with no help available (other than technical) via phone. My main point of contact, Holly, would respond promptly to email queries, though would clearly not read my email properly and therefore not answer half of my questions. This lead to days wasted and too many unnecessary emails.Overall, I studied a Cert IV in Business Admin. The content of the course was hit and miss, with some topics useful, and most not unnecessary - i.e. the complicated finance module 10.Pay the extra money and do the TAFE alternative. I have now studied via correspondence with both institutions and would not recommend this one as a viable choice. It was difficult to gain motivation to keep going with all the issues encountered."

Very happy with them. The course material is very good and helpful. Assignments are easy to follow. Staff are quick to respond."
5,2017-07-10T23:20:06.000Z,A Transformative Experience :),I found the program extremely relevant to the growth of the business. Networking and the guidance from the tutors propelled my business to the next level. Pushed me to work smarter by systemising my processes. Many key points I will continue to take on board in my practice everyday and also for future ventures! Highly recommend ;)
1,2017-07-10T11:28:45.000Z,I honestly thought this was a joke...,"I honestly thought this was a joke when I received this email and you will probably write this off as a disgruntled trainee but Open Colleges was the most unprofessional RTO I have ever dealt with, for the following reasons;1. You lied to me constantly about numerous things, such as course content, completion times and response times.2. Online trainers are substandard and unless I copied and paste from online material would be constantly marked incorrect with no reason.3. The turn around time was never adhered too. Some items took months to mark.4. The call center is dysfunctional and would never follow through with what they promised.5. I have completed my course and my online percentage is still 93%, go figure. Everything was submitted months ago.6. The trainers would book appointments for phone interviews and never call or email to give excuse. I would end up following up and was told very abruptly to book an appointment.7. The trainers would send me emails with different peoples names and details, asking for content already submitted and marked correct.8. The training package was of a very poor quality.9. The online complaints form is a joke when all I received back was an email telling me you had reviewed and closed my case, with no way forward or outcome.10. I was informed I could complete this course in 3 months but due to Open Colleges pathetic response rate, it took me over 18 months. This certainly cost me a lot of money at work as my promotion was delayed and almost cost me my job.11. The trainers were oblivious to the stress they cause by constantly calling and emailing my boss, just to request the same material they had already received.12. The way the call center answers the phones is disgusting.I honestly could go on for a long time with this but I know this will fall on deaf ears as when I was a student you completely ignored my requests. I would rate my experience with OC as a zero out of ten and could not recommend your company to anyone. I will be reporting your company to asqa and do hope you learn from this and make it better for the next students.Please feel free to call me to discuss further as I am happy to give further feedback.Regards,Karen"

Yes, I would recommend anyone interested in learning about fiction or poetic writing to to undertake the course."

3,2017-07-06T09:21:13.000Z,A frustrating experience.,"I found my overall experience to be extremely frustrating.I found that the course material was ok but the assignments were very hard to decipher. They were badly written with grammatical and wording errors or just did not make sense. Sometimes watching a webinar on an assignment gave a different picture of what was required to how the assignment read.Although I found my Trainer to be very quick to respond to me (which was very much appreciated) I found that my specific questions were not always addressed. I sometimes found that the guidance I was given was just as, if not more confusing than reading the assignments.I often looked for answers on the Open Space posts but found that people appeared to be encouraged to message trainers privately and would not get their questions answered for others to see. These were general questions which would help many other students. I would also think that it would save the Trainers and assessors much time, as if they answered questions in the posts, it would  save them answering the same individual question time after time.Another issue I found was that when my Trainer went on leave, the replacement Trainer did not appear to answer anyone's posts......Perhaps OC could read some of the posts to see the frustration students are feeling."

4,2017-07-06T08:48:15.000Z,Student and trainers were brilliant,"Student support was brilliant, always someone there to help out when need. Course was fairly simple to grasp, just need all the links to work consistently to external material. Only a few times did the assessment questions confuse but after looking at it again more carefully you comprehended it. Feedback from trainers was great and helped you grow after each assessment and self checks. Some trainers were amazing and provided additional tips to grow and strengthen your skill set.Trainers really know the area of study and are working in it at same time, which is helpful to you.You must be prepared to learn programs on own as only minimal is taught in the modules with expectation to study on external online tutorials. Not an issue but be prepared to equate this into your study timetable. Extension was easy to organise, with a minimum fee. Overall well worth it, nice and flexible. I got out exactly what I put into the course; hard work and great results. Thanks heaps I'm a very happy student.  More a 4.5 star just minor tweaks needed."
3,2017-07-06T06:37:10.000Z,Online study can be tricky,"Online study is very tricky if you are not used to this type of study. It's really all about how much effort you want to put in and how much you should engage with the trainers. Overall, my experience has been good and the material was helpful. My only constructive criticism is that I would recommend that all Student Support staff be on the same page when communicating news or updates to students so that they all don't hear different stories."

1,2017-07-05T06:09:03.000Z,Open colleges have been the most,"Open colleges have been the most unsupportive RTO (if you can call them that) for my partner. During his course his emails have gone unanswered and is expected to know all the answers to assignments and quizzes without having any content in the modules. Open Colleges have refused a refund on several occasions, even though we have provided beyond enough evidence, and documentation more than what they asked for, however they have a different excuse every time they receive the documents and evidence. Open Colleges should be shut down. Please avoid signing up with them. You will not receive support and expect to know everything. We have lost $3000 because of this dodgy company! Avoid at all costs!"

There are videos explaining Lightroom for example but no step by step instructions - and no reading list!  The course materials need a comprehensive revision to remove internal contradictions and inconsistencies.  But the trainers are great - quick, responsive and helpful."

3,2017-07-03T07:18:26.000Z,"Solid, but needs some polishing.","Course material was solid and comprehensive.  It could have used a proof read.My issue was that the course trainers were slow to respond to questions, and the course was transitioned to a newer course half way through - which was handled poorly. I was left thinking I'd finished, but had a module still to do - to their credit they did give me extra time to complete once the issue was discovered.A decent training provider, but in need of some 'polishing' in their processes."

2,2017-07-02T02:10:22.000Z,Work Travel Placement - no support,"I have recently graduated with a Certificate III in Travel and feel Open Colleges provided little to no support especially in terms of the 'mandatory' 120 hour work travel placement. I live in a capital city and approached 17 travel agencies without success - most agencies citing they did not have the resources to host a placement or only hosted students from other institutions. Finally after 6 months of trying to find a placement without any assistance from Open Colleges I was fortunate to secure a placement with a couple who ran a business from their home and they supported me for 40 hours. With 80 hours remaining of the placement I didn't know what to do and sought assistance from Open Colleges without success. Thankfully I was able to submit travel bookings I make at work as evidence and these enabled me to graduate.My suggestion to Open Colleges for including a 'mandatory' work travel placement in this course is to enter into Service Agreements with several agencies who are willing to host their students. The stress involved in trying to find a placement without support is not warranted. Students should be given a list of agencies to approach and feel confident that they will be given a work travel placement. As I stated previously, I live in a capital city - not sure how students who live in regional areas manage to find placements."

Thank you very much to you all!On the other hand, its website needs better attention. My course was revised while I was studying and maybe because of it, my progress still shows 78% when I already got a certificate of completion of my course.

The only issue was having the assessments, course notes and instructions up to date. Some needed to be changed as they were out of date and applied only to previous years.

2,2017-06-26T00:55:35.000Z,Graphic Design course was disappointing,"I feel OpenSpace needs a lot of improvement. The learning activities are not looked at by Open College staff, with feedback only coming from fellow learners occasionally. I personally feel I need more feedback from experts, not fellow students who are also only learning. I feel the user interface of OpenSpace is not user friendly at all - things are hard to find, navigation is not streamlined, and the forums are atrocious. The message platform could use some work and the interaction with module facilitators could be much better. I did not submit anything for a whole year and no one noticed or bothered to ask if I had any problems. Luckily I was able to get an extension, otherwise the entire course would have been a waste of time. I feel that the course content does not relate completely to the assignments. I feel that it is ridiculous to ask for us to complete a website design in a program we have never used and the course material has not covered. Don't tell me to watch YouTube Videos to learn how to use DreamWaever!!! What am I paying Open College for if I have to learn through YouTube videos???? I think that this college needs to up it's game. The course content has numerous spelling and grammatical errors, the lecturers need to give more feedback and relate to each student on a more personal level. I had to get in touch with a Facebook group to give me feedback as the forum is useless for any feedback. I am very glad I am finished my course and have my certificate."

With respect to the way the course is run it was excellent.  For somebody like myself, an IT professional, it was easy to navigate and access all the required areas.  I didnt find certain parts of the site of use such as the student lounge primarily because any questions that I may have had were answered on the Facebook page.  There were a number of errors in the material or quizes which I raised at the time.  Some of the material may need to be updated, particularly in the later stages where social media is probably more prominent as a means of attracting clients than a web site although a web site is still very important. Overall though I was very happy with the course, the trainers and their feedback.  I learnt a great deal and it has helped me start a secondary income source."

I do think i would have preffered an alert/email when my grades came through rather than checking over and over creating alot of anxiety. At times grades took longer than 3 business days which was frustrating, and i did find towards the end i was getting quite vague and unhelpful answers to questions i had asked when i was stuck, i took it upon myself to do more research as i couldnt be bothered waiting for responses. I do feel that majority of the content was well set out and certainly relevant to my job role. I really appreciate the flexibility with the extension too."

Some of the course work could be a bit repetitive but it all helps to reinforce the knowledge being obtained. My only criticism would be that there appears to be a shortage of people to assess work place assessments and I had to keep asking where some things were at over a period of months to ensure it all got done before the course end date.

5,2017-06-13T03:37:18.000Z,My honest opinion.,"Over the past 3 or 4 years approximately, I have studied 2 courses through Open Colleges - and I intend on continuing my studies with OC in the future. Throughout my enrolment, I have been provided with amazing support from the Veterinary Nursing staff at OC, and I cannot thank them enough for their hard work and dedication. Without them, I would not be where I am now. I haven't dealt with the general Student Support division; however in the rare times that I have dealt with them, they have been a pleasure! During my studies I deferred for a period of 3 months. The deferral process was made very easy and straightforward by OC as well. I would 110% recommend OC to anyone who wishes to pursue distance education for whatever reason. I chose distance education as it was convenient for myself at the time, and I do not regret it.Thank you to all of the staff at Open Colleges; I commemorate you for all of your efforts and dedication to providing distance education to people around Australia. Keep up the good work!"

I am glad I approached Open Colleges and spoke to one of their efficient team members. That was actually a Life changing day! I enjoyed their study formats, Learning materials and assessments whilst completing my other responsibilities without any stress.The team at Open Colleges are a bunch of some really amazing and wonderful people, they are easy to approach, are very helpful, and always available whenever you required their help regarding any issue.I can write on and on but to cut it short I enjoyed studying at Open Colleges I got the required support regarding the extension of the course as I was struggling to get it complete on time and they happily not only support me but give me more than required extension time. Their trainers and assessors and Student Support Team were very helpful. At the end as they say: ""Life changing education"" and they actually provide it :)"

4,2017-06-09T01:44:22.000Z,Enjoyed the course and gained new skills,"Overall I enjoyed the course and gained some valuable skills, I also found my workplace assessor to be very helpful and knowledgeable. I did find reply times on messages to trainers a little slow at times, which was frustrating when trying to finish an assignment. I also found quite often that the wording of questions was not specific enough and I was having to contact trainers to clarify. The length and detail required for these questions was quite often not specified either. I also feel for my course that it would be beneficial for students if they could move into the work placement earlier, allowing students to apply the skills in a practical setting as they are learning them. I feel this would help students to understand the relevance of what they are learning in the theory and help them to stay focused and motivated to complete the work."

1,2017-06-07T22:50:02.000Z,Do NOT enrol with Open Colleges!,"Do you your research first!! I wish I had. Open Colleges is the worst experience I've had with any education/training provider ever! The course materials were full of errors and out of date information and the assessments are poorly structured and written. The trainer wasn't qualified or experienced and so far from being an expert in the field that it wasn't funny. The trainer was changed but students were still being told to Google for answers or that the trainer had to check with course writers before they could answer questions. Assessment feedback was copied and pasted across different students' assessments, citing things they hadn't even done or included, as well as inconsistent assessment marking between different trainers. Once Open Colleges have your money they couldn't care less for you as a student or as a paying customer. Their complaints resolution system is a joke, unfair and inconsistent in their assessments and outcomes. Biggest waste of time and money I've ever experienced. You couldn't pay me to study with this company again."

2,2017-06-02T02:59:38.000Z,I found the overall experience to be not overly beneficial.,"I found the overall experience to be just ok.- support was lacking. The online portal has the potential to be great, but responses to questions were very poor. If a question was asked about an assignment or particular question, the trainer would simply repeat the question back as a response, providing no real clarification.- content was poor. To cover Ergonomics THREE times was a total waste, and to have to research printers was ridiculous. In one assignment we were required to write a personal work plan pretending to work for a particular company - this would have been much more beneficial and motivating if it was based on real life. I felt like much more time could have been devoted to something much more beneficial.- the audio components of EVERY unit was a waste of time. If this really is necessary, it would be much better done with an assessor via skype or similar, to create a proper dialogue. More often than not it was simply repeating everythingwe had just written in the first part of the assignment, with a participant who knew nothing of the course.- when I initially spoke with someone before I decided on the course, I explained I wanted a course foucessed on payroll and accounts - her recommendation was this course, which was really rather wrong. Very little time was spent on either of these topucs.- I cant help but wonder about the marking system. I submitted one or two assignments that I felt were inferior quality and I still recieved a distinction.- I received a phone call when I was halfway through the final unit, ""just touching base and to see if I needed any help."" Rather pointless given I was 95% finished.- I don't think the certificate would really carry much weight in the minds of employers based on the content and how generous I found the markimg to be."
4,2017-06-02T02:30:32.000Z,Review,"I found that it was very hard to upload videos when we were not allowed to do audio's. When Uploading assessments, there is a limit of how much  you can upload and some of my video files exceeded that limit even when I had compressed the files. The assessors are very helpful when you have questions."
1,2017-06-02T01:32:41.000Z,I don't understand what I did wrong...,"I don't understand what I did wrong to be treated so poorly in this course. I submitted all assignments, edited them when I was asked - and still I was expected to wait multiple weeks and MONTHS for grades to come back and for the next modules to be unlocked.I honestly would never ever recommend this service to anyone, even people I don't like."
3,2017-06-01T22:57:45.000Z,I thought the fact that you had to find ‚Ä¶,I thought the fact that you had to find your own external supervision on some assessments unfair in relation to the money paid to do the course.  There were also typos throughout the course and in one of the  quizzes the answer that Open Colleges has earmarked is wrong and it is not until you question this that you are advised - this affects the ability to pass that quiz.

2,2017-05-30T10:16:53.000Z,Many issues with Open Colleges,"1. When working through module workbooks, completing the learning activities within them, there have been numerous times where a link has been given to complete question/s and the link has not worked. The computer states that there is an error with the link. I have on a couple of occasions, had to message staff to receive a replacement link. However, the broken link problem became so frequent I stopped sending emails to assessors as almost all of links I tried to access were unavailable. This problem was taking up too much valuable study time as I had to wait for a response, just to complete reading materials. I noticed other students were having this problem as they wrote about it on the student discussion board, they received no response that was helpful for them nor myself.2. I feel as though the questions in assessments are not detailed enough. When working through assessment pieces I answer the questions to the best of my ability and to how the question is worded. A lot of the feedback I receive has been in regards to ‚Äúnot giving enough detail‚Äù within questions, however, the questions have not been worded in a way where it asks for such detail. The only guide I have to know how much work is required per question is a box underneath the question that says ‚Äúmarks out of 5‚Äù. If the question requires more detail, I believe a word count should be necessary so that I am not marked down and have to reattempt the assessment piece. Once again, this takes up valuable study time, where I could be progressing, rather than backtracking, having to fix silly mistakes that could be avoided through a better assessment layout and marking scheme.3. I have had problems in the past with assessors/trainers not responding to my messages at all. Response times from trainers and assessors are too long and make my studies inefficient. This leaves me feeling alone and unsupported within my studies. I feel as though I have been left to my own devices.4. The content within the workbooks I am provided does not always correspond to assessment questions. Examples of this are:-	I got marked incorrectly for stating the use of ABC would be appropriate in an emergency situation because it should have been DRABC. However, when referring back to my workbook (module 9 workbook) I noticed that the acronym DRABC was not written anywhere. The OPEN COLLEGES booklet referred to it as ABC.-	In the same assessment piece (module 9 assessment) I was answering a question asking me how to treat a kitten that had been called away from a dog. I was asked to reattempt this question as I did not state what medication was required as a part of the kittens healing process. None of the modules I have completed to date, have taught me about different medications and what situations to use them in. If the question required this of me, it should have asked ‚Äúwhat medications are required‚Äù AND the corresponding knowledge should have been accessible through the workbook or referred me to the additional resources available on OpenSpace.5. In the same assessment (module 9), the assessor (Robyn Bardsley) referred to me as ‚ÄòEmma‚Äô when giving feedback. I found this to be very offensive as it made me feel like the assessor was not paying attention to who she was marking and it made me wonder if my responses were being read correctly. I question whether or not feedback is simply copy and pasted by assessors from other students work. This lack of attention to detail is extremely rude. I also found it ironic that I was told to improve my spelling/grammar in assessments, when Robyn herself made multiple spelling and grammar mistakes. I believe assessors and trainers should lead by example.6. OpenSpace is poorly constructed - lags, breaks down, very basic system - could be imrpoved with better uploading and messaging systems"

They've not enough staff, so questions can go unanswered for quite some time, anywhere up to 2 weeks in my experience.If you're an independent learner, this school will work for you, however, if you believe you need regular support, try tafe.

I did finish it in time but have now had to do a bridging course before going into cert iv which is virtually everything I just completed the first time round because I didn't have employment. Also having to complete another 33hrs of work placement (I had just completed 80hrs) for something I was already qualified in is plain frustrating especially living in a rural area with limited facilities/trainers. I was happy with the College when I started with it but since ""transitioning"" in Mar 2017, I have been very unhappy. There have been delays in getting modules as they are ""still in progress"", 1 module came out with info and the assessments came out 3 weeks later, spelling mistakes everywhere in the modules. There is no communication to tell students that there are delays unless you call and by then you have already waited. There was no communication to say that the only way to get the workplace approval form was to message the trainer (and this was after student support said they would email it to me). The new system is highly flawed and courses should not be opened until they are ready. Would not recommend Open Colleges. If I hadn't already paid for cert iv, I would go elsewhere."

However there was a number of errors in study materials and online tests. The student support team were not very helpful or knowledgable and would provide contradictory information.

That didn't happen and I delivered what was asked from me. Plus your informations about changes and requirements and the time frame to achieve that was only 1 month. There is a big restriction with taking practice or work placement if I compare the one from TAFE. Because my time was good during tackling modules 1-3 , I worked for 9 months 2 days a week as a volunteer.  That was not taken into your considuration because did not fit in your time frame.

Was pushed into enrolling because ""ill never get a deal like this again"" - ended up paying $6500 on a payment plan, which isn't bad at all. The issues i have had and still do have are as follows;1. Communication at enrolment -  I was NEVER told that this course was ""still under development"". Which is very scary putting my money into it, not knowing the outcome.2. The price in general. After many consultations with other students and data collection and analysis, there is a huge gap in pricing - anywhere from $5500 up to $10,000. Still have not received a response from Open Colleges direct as to why so many girls are charged such drastic different amounts. As one of the girls said when she spoke with their student support ""they told me it depended on who i spoke to and that they choose how much they want to charge and when"" This is absolutely wrong in so many ways.This is just a warning to those wanting to study with Open Colleges especially the Diploma of Beauty Therapy. ASK QUESTIONS!! Just because it is cheap, doesn't always mean it is the best option to go with."

It would be good if the first aid training was included as a part of the fees and do not have to pay separately on top of the fees which is annoying, must disclose this information when students join the OC. overall, its good to start with."

The assignments are cryptically worded (I'm also a university graduate so i know my assignments..), i had instances in which it took days to get a reply, and the response was a copy and pasted bit of text which hardly answered my questions! I even had one moment where a question gave the wrong directions and it wasn't until i pointed it out because i kept getting the answer wrong by following the damn instructions! In all fairness though i did complete my course in a year and have gained employment in my chosen pathway.

I was given no email, letter or phone call prior to this to explain the situation. Because of the lack of communication, the deadline had expired and I had no choice but to  transfer onto the new course and all of the work I had completed so far, would not count for anything. I had to stop my placement as according to the new course rules, you are not allowed to start a placement until reaching a particular point. This caused considerable upset and frustration with the professionals at the placement who viewed Open Colleges as unprofessional and disorganised. They stated they would no longer accept anybody from Open Colleges as they didn't trust the institution to not behave in a professional way.  The College Placement Tutor was taking several weeks to respond with my placement feedback so when I emailed to find out if everything was ok, she admitted she had lost work that I had submitted and I needed to submit this again. I feel if I had not chased her on the issue, I would not have known this as no communication was sent to me. Overall, the tutors were unhelpful, lacked communication with one another for moderation of assessments and Open Space was poorly set up and had lots of issues with uploading various documents and videos.I am very disappointed with the College and will not be recommending this institution in the future to anyone."

2,2017-05-19T02:39:55.000Z,"Good material, hard placement","The course material was great. It was easy to follow and working through the assessments independently was relatively easy and support was always there when needed. Although, when it came to work placement, it was very hard to find anyone willing to take on a trainee and in my particular case, I was bullied at the workplace I went to. I would suggest that you offer workshops for your students to do the placement hours in. A lot less stressful for the students. I would recommend to friends if there was this support in the course."

2,2017-05-19T02:33:16.000Z,Overpriced for one,"Overpriced for one, poor student support. Provide a fasade filled with hopes and dreams in regards to client outcomes (job opportunities, etc.) Learning material is some areas was quite good. Some assessment questions were vague."
3,2017-05-19T02:20:02.000Z,THere were many errors in the course ‚Ä¶,"THere were many errors in the course and even when I told them the error it didn't seem to be corrected.When emailing lecturers for support often went unanswered so you just had to muddle along on your own.There were some very good employees up until Dec 16 and then they all disappeared, leaving absences that were not filled satisfactory.The assessments were some very poorly written and you just felt like you were muddling along with little support.I think there needs to be a big overhaul of this establishment and actually help the students that have many big $$$."
5,2017-05-19T02:16:30.000Z,FLEXIBLE LEARNING WITH GOOD SUPPORT,I appreciated the flexibility the courses offered. Tuition staff were excellent in giving constructive feedback and support.

The material has some improvements but also good things about the old material have been lost such as the instructional videos and the ability to make rapid changes to the website to fix issues.  It also takes some trainers a long time to respond to questions but again that is probably due to ironing out issues with the new material.

1,2017-05-19T01:53:18.000Z,Elementary standard of teaching,"Unhelpful, outdated and elementary. Course work was not helpful and irrelevant. Teachers are not equipped properly as some of the courses offered shouldn't be available online. Studying online with open colleges is full of frustration and anxiety as the system is not working half the time and help and support staff are useless. I was once told 'I did not care about my studies' when I complained the website was constantly unavailable. All I did was simply ask if they could fix the issues with websites."

Level of difficulty and expectations appropriate for people of all ages with varying life circumstances. Would reccomend to friends with busy life schedules or people looking for a new way to learn.
2,2017-05-15T12:43:21.000Z,The flexibility of online learning is the only positive I have found so far to this course,"No one answers your questions online or it takes ages to actually receive an answer to your emails. The next module doesn't get automatically unlocked after submitting the assessments, so it feels like everything is gone to make you waste time so that you won't be able to finish the bourse in due time (and would then have to pay extra money to study longer). Also, after reading the course and all the documents in the links, I still felt like I had to do a lot of personal research to be able to answer their portfolio questions and written assessment. Sometimes it really felt like the matter hadn't been mentioned on the module at all! Some questions are also unclear, too vague so you don't know if you're answering properly or not."
5,2017-05-15T12:28:11.000Z,Excellent College,"The information, service and friendliness of staff is fabulous.  I highly recommend Open Colleges to anyone who is seriously interested in gaining a certificate.  They are always there for you, the site is easy to navigate, and information abounds.  Fabulous."

She answered all of my questions perfectly, informed me brilliantly and followed up with me every time that I got busy and couldn't finish the enrollment process right away. The woman who ran my webinar was fantastic and patient and spoke in detail. I'm very impressed with the simplicity and how easy it is to work Open Space and also all of the support that is on offer.

2,2017-05-15T06:57:34.000Z,Terrible.,"Terrible.It's been 1 month now and this is one of the worst decisions I've made in my 33 years on this planet.In the beginning I noticed spelling and grammatical errors in the content (cert2 electro tech). Moving on from that I began my first assessment only to find questions relating to topics not covered in my learning material. After hours of scouring the material (thinking I'd missed something) I tried my best and submitted the assessment only to receive failure notice with a comment to refer to X section in the training material. I then spent more time (hours) referring to X section in the training material and could not find the information required. I double checked with the trainer who came back with a comment that I was right, the relevant material is actually missing ""sorry"". I was then told they expected I'd already have knowledge of this topic prior to signing up to the course, however, the course has no prerequisites.Next I moved onto module 2 only to find serious problems with the content here as well. Section X is a mirror image of section Y but with different titles. After 24 hours I received confirmation that they had made a mistake with a system update and that it would be fixed the following day. This is not great for me considering today is my day off (my ""study day"") and tomorrow I'm back at work.I will do everything I can to cancel this course and see about doing it at TAFE instead."

The biggest difficulty I had was uploading the videos in Module 3.  I also found completing the written portfolio requirements for the work placement module (9) frustrating.  The instructions were tedious and confusing for each portfolio and I found this quite stressful.  The assessment phone calls were difficult to schedule during my placement as the timing was often inconvenient in a busy workplace.The support I received was terrific and the response time to my queries was very short. I feel very relieved, satisfied and rewarded to have come to the end of my on-line training course and look forward to receiving my certificate."

I've found that the assessors are very helpful and friendly, the student support always seems happy to help and have always helped me when I needed it. The bad side is that you have to do all the learning yourself, which can be difficult when you can't find the motivation, I wish they had more learning activities, like actual worksheets and things like that to help learn and remember things better (like back in high school). I love how you have multiple attempts at the assessments since I suffer from test anxiety and completely screw up when under pressure, so at least that takes the pressure off, and the assessor feedback helps with getting a better mark next time as well as helping me understand the questions better.I really like open colleges and everything is good so far with them :)"

I know I'm responsible for allowing my lapse due to life, would of liked someone to check in again to see if I need help, which I do. I have contact numbers, just life got in the way and I never get there. So maybe at least monthly check in"

I had to google so many things to complete my assessment because the information from the learning material doesnt say too much. Plus, the assessor takes his time to answer our questions and in consequence we are stuck with no possibility to continue for days as we have to wait for his answer or grades.

Overall, I know I can get support from student support when I need it in which I intended to do when started my course again.Emilia"
5,2017-04-20T01:23:13.000Z,I'm enjoying Open Colleges experiences,I have found the course to be easy enough to navigate mostly on my own but if I have needed feedback it's always been available.  Any phone contact with Open Colleges has always been a positive experience.  I'm happy with them and highly recommend them.
4,2017-04-20T01:16:11.000Z,My Review,I think open colleges is a great way to further education and get a certificate. I like that I can take the course at my own pace. The teachers (or whatever they're called) have great feedback and make sure the assignments are done correctly. I personally think the course I'm doing is a bit expensive but other than that open colleges is an inviting and welcoming way to learn.
4,2017-04-20T01:12:07.000Z,They were great,"They were great, however a few times it took days for assessors to get back to me...if you are great at self-motivating then online learning is for you..."

Rang many times on the weekend and of a night and always was assisted promptly and very understanding.  Modules were assessed in a timely manner and on a couple of times next modules were opened so I could continue on with my studies.  I did have a problem with the payment side but that was not Open Colleges issue.  Would recommend this way to study for anyone who can work at their own pace and when they can as it can be a bit difficult when you have family and working.  I think the to begin with is get yourself in to a routine and if you are struggling ring and ask for direction.  I really can't recommend highly enough.Best of luck to future students.....

4,2017-04-19T21:39:47.000Z,Review of Open Colleges,"Was able to work at my own pace. All of materials needed were posted and easily accessible on the website. Tutors and assessors were prompt with turnaround of assessments and feedback on work produced. Student support services were fantastic with their knowledge and assistance. The course layout encouraged independence and self motivation and as an only negative, my concern would be for those that needed a more personal approach to their tuition. However, this approach although initially difficult to address, developed within me stronger determination and persistence and eventually enabled me to complete the course and look forward to further study with greater confidence."
3,2017-04-18T16:29:13.000Z,Good but be careful before you choose.,"It was good to learn with Open Colleges, although sometimes was stressing with communication with the trainers, support team. Harder to learn online, not for everyone and need to learn patience while studying if you choose to go ahead."

Assessors and tutors were helpful and friendly. The only thing that I personally found difficult were the numerous assessments that needed to be completed whilst on work placement.
3,2017-04-17T09:36:07.000Z,I completed the Diploma in Management ‚Ä¶,"I completed the Diploma in Management and Leadership, hoping that this qualification would propel my job opportunities forward in the health car setting.Personally I struggles with the course. Specifically, the IT component and the working of my Apply computer.The video recording were a huge stress for me, problems saving the content and then submitting for marking.Motivation was also a major issue for me, I lost sight of the big picture because of a stressful work situation. Consequently I didn't touch the course content for two months or more. However, once I made it past the halve way mark, the percentage counter was a source of motivation - to see my goal reacher close to 100%.The outcome of the course for me - perhaps I could have better spent the time with tertiary studies, which is more recognised by the health care sector."
4,2017-04-15T23:23:26.000Z,Getting into a routine of how to ‚Ä¶,"Getting into a routine of how to complete assignments in a manner to satisfy assessor(s) was a big initial 'stumbling block' for me - my poor word processing skills and some limitations with the english language did not help!  Discovery of Charu's guidance video links were, without doubt; my saviour - had thoughts of quitting course early on.Have achieved similar qualification in my place of birth (Philippines) but my achievements of this course have provided me with greater sense of pride and determination - have no intention of changing my Hospital P.S.A. job.  Thanks to all."

4,2017-04-14T07:13:05.000Z,I really enjoyed studying with Open Colleges - Interior design and decoration,"I really enjoyed studying with Open Colleges  online.  The material was very well presented and the website very easy to navigate.  Overall, the support was fantastic from both the course advisors and the teaching staff.  I have studied online through two universities previously and neither of them were  anywhere near as well organised for online learning as Open Colleges.  I did find though that for my latest assessment I did not receive the help I required to complete it and due to other personal issues was unable to  continue with my studies.  I do fully intend to re-enrol in the course as soon as personal circumstances allow this.  The course fully met my needs and the learning material was presented in a manner that made learning fun and engaging.There were good discussions with other students and generally the staff were amazing and extremely helpful so I don't understand what went wrong with my final assessment.   I was also very, very pleased with the very fast turnaround on assessment gradings.   In the past I have often had to wait weeks for assessments to be marked and returned, but  Open Colleges always did this within 2 days, and the comprehensive feedback was very helpful and pertinent, which I really appreciated."
