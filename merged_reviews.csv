1,13-04-2023,this college is a disgrace,the colleges assessment return times are months not the advertised  business daysthe old online platform was outdated the new online learning platform doesn't function properlythe student support is extremely unhelpful they mostly do not even reply to emails and if they do they do so with extreme delays and unhelpful repliesso many more problems with itthis college is a disgrace never again
1,12-04-2023,open colleges is a scam,if you value your mental health dont waste your time by applying to possibly the worst education provider in australia the staff turnover is ridiculous the staff yell at you and berate you every chance they get ive been falsely accused by staff i have been threatened by staff it takes months for them to mark assessments the online learning platform is riddled with mistakes and inaccuracies so much so that it looks like its been created by a  year old most of the educators do not have any form of qualifications to be educators ive read more witnessed instances of staff berating students for correcting their mistakes ive seen staff run out of class rooms crying because theyve been caught out by lying and providing false information to students my mental health is at such a stage now after attending open colleges that i have problems sleeping and due to the threats ive been subjected to am afraid for my personal safety  please dont put your mental and physical health at risk by attending or applying to open colleges it will be the worst mistake you ever make
2,11-04-2023,half way through and the platform changes for the worse,the learning platform was what sold me on this online course half way though my course they upgrade the learning platform it was a big hype up for a deevolved downgrade for a platform that used to be community based easy to work through would save where you were up to and easy to contact trainers  this has all been taken away with no regard to how it would effect the students learning materials have not been transferred across in entirety and if you didnt have access to the old platform simultaneously you would not know to contact t read morerainers you need to now do this via your external email the activities cant be done on the platform so doesnt entice you to actually do them and there is no longer a community base to look at others answers for different views and opinions there is no longer a study buddy option all up if i could get a refund and transfer to another provider i would i would not recommend this training provider until the platform improves
1,11-04-2023,scam,don't even bother you are literally paying them to not talk to you just throw your money in the bin because you'll get the same result
1,04-04-2023,so terrible please dont never take classes with this,we are in at least april  and still in the same situation even worse nothing has changed since  opencollege still taking payment of money without doing nothing the educator is never here to correct my courses  and customer service is the worse i never seen in my life now i understand why so many bad reviews aboutopencollege it should be shared with a lot of people to avoid falling into the trapalmost  months that i am with open college and too much delay too much injustice in the process motivation of the students have completed read more the modules and still waiting teachers to review my modules to let me completed the work placement there is not following close with student  they do everything to put the students very very low very unfair despite the calls etcconversation it gets worse and worsemajority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist and teachers don't care about it even you try to explain that the link are not working anymoreteachers putting not satisfactory every second paragraph even i try my best they booked me appointment for teacher training finally canceled it without raison and confirmation they are not care about studentscustomer service are speaking not really correctly and are not understanding what is sure i will talk about open college a lot so that avoids people to fall in the trapi'm still waiting for how long you cannot do your job properly as a training
5,03-04-2023,hlt certificate  in dental assisting,dorina iancu was an excellent trainer who assisted me multiple times and was great at explaining things i was very satisfied with the course content and find it useful in my current job the course held significant amount of difficulty where i was challenged yet the assignments were able to be completed
1,30-03-2023,scam,i believe this place is a scam i canceled the course with them within the  day cooling period and was told that the course was canceled  weeks later they have taken  out of my account and still counting i have called  times only to sit on hold for over an hour and have someone tell me that the money would be refunded this has not been the case today was the th call with someone telling me the same story stay far far away from this place
1,28-03-2023,do not enrol with open colleges,its very draining and frustrating i enrolled in nail certificate iii last year november and i am now regretting choosing open college for my course as i was almost finished with my academic work and they did not help me to find my placement as they say in beginning when you enquire them''we will help you to find placement in case you don't find''  and they did not help at allstudent support made me to do my course again due to transition from openspace to open spacex all time they have technical issues which need to be fixed to continue my co read moreurse and i contacted student support its been more than three weeks i am calling and emailing them i have  months to finish my course i feel half of time i will be waiting  fix technical issues  i am not getting any reply back from student support and technical issues are not fixed do not know what to do  i feel i have no choice of taking this further and make formal complaint against them as i have had enough all open college is want just your money  i would suggest do not study with open college
1,23-03-2023,this college and the people who run it are useless,i've finished my course  i have called open colleges over  times in the past fortnight via email and phone call for an email confirmation so i can attend interviews  since finishing or since paying my course off i have had no communication from this crap of a college  no email no text no phone call  nothing  i have an interview on monday it's thursday  i've called and called and emailed  no communication whatsoever  absolutely furious
5,23-03-2023,thank you,i have learnt a lot  very useful material dorina the assessor is  very supportive and so friendly  she replies very quick even if it's weekendshe kept pushing me to finish on timei really appreciate it
1,18-03-2023,don't waste your money scam,i am stuck studying the diploma of counselling i submitted my very last assessment on the  december  it is now  march  and haven't heard from anyone this is when in thier own policy states assessments are marked within  days i've sent emails to facilitators and student support only to fall on deaf ears this institution just wants your money as when your about to qualify they go to ground i also made a formal complaint through the institution again falling on deaf ears i have now made a formal complaint through austral read moreian skills and quality authority due to the non existent support also dont hold your breath if you have to do work placement they pretend to help by asking for an application but do nothing we get taught to do assessment plans perhaps this college needs to learn how to do management plans as its appalling the main and only assessor is in the uk while there is a backlog of assessments continous smoke and mirrors and no action what is the college doing to rectify this nothing do this diploma through aipc or a selected university with good reviews
5,15-03-2023,open college is the way to start your studies,honestly dorina my teacher has made my learning experience very easy and stress free i dont think i would be able to complete the course without her helpthe over all course of my certificate iii in dental assisting was very informative and had easy accesssupport team was always there when needed and where very helpfuldefinitely would do a course with open colleges again
1,14-03-2023,unprofessional people worst college,if i can rate it lower than  star i will the course is  yrs instead of  months the course coordinator is not helpful if you defer though youre done with the module she will still ask you to attend the class again not practical i suggest do uni than study with them or enrol elsewhere theory can be done online with other colleges
1,10-03-2023,they don't really care about their duty of care you are just  to them,i was about to get a job as a student support officer at stride learning i would have also chosen to study with them if i had known about them before i started with open college i was doing really well for the first  weeks and hit a stumbling block i reached out for help and was given a very vague response the expectations of some of the assignments are not clear and it is hard to find more information on what is expected i then go covid then found a new job part of the reason i chose to start studying  i chose the new job over the st read moreride learning job stride learning during the interview stated that they call people after two weeks of no progress they talk them through any issues and strive to have zero dropouts for any other reason than those that are compassionate and compelling i got one email that looked like an advertisement after  weeks of not doing anything didn't get anything else no emails no phone calls to offer support until i asked to withdraw from the course i tried to complain and state that if they had followed their duty of care and called me earlier like in july or august i may have been able to either complete the assignment or withdraw from it earlier and be able to get more money back than i am getting now i missed the october cutoff because of their lack of care stay away
5,05-03-2023,excellent rtos than tafe nsw,open college  fits with my study needs  very self paced non stressful environment the staff was really easily to handle over the phone and the trainer itself i have study at tafe digital thier serivces wasn't very pleasant to learn very emotionally stressed out constantly and very high demanding  teachers doesn't know what they are doing most of the timeopen college portal open space x is very simple and easily to navigate with a click of q button had podcast intractive video and quizto be honest paying for open college is an investment toward me career i recommend this rto provider if it is within your allocated budget
5,08-12-2022,excellent,i started my diploma  years ago and just completed it when i started i have a  year old and through the time i completed the diploma i had my second child the flexibility of studying online has been great ros has been an excellent support throughout the process
1,06-12-2022,star rating if it was possible,i applied to do a cert  in animal studies but heard and read bad reviews on open colleges  days later i called to cancel as i thought it was a horrible course to do especially if i was going to get scammed the tcs for cancelling were not made clear to me and now have to pay for something that i didn't even do my friends went through the same thing and i have read many reviews similar to mine do not recommend open colleges waste of time money and sanity
5,02-12-2022,fantastic,enrolling myself in the diploma and heading down the online path was daunting at first especially juggling work and kids but i was pleasantly surprised how user friendly the whole course has been the course content is easy to follow and manage you do need good time management and motivation to stay on track however the student support has been fantastic helpful tip use the assessment walkthroughs they will be your life saver
5,24-11-2022,very happy with the course and trainers,i just completed certificate iii in dental assissting and would definitely recommend iti truly enjoyed this course i appreciated how the support and motivation  from the trainersthe trainers and assessors were fantastic especially dorina iancu  very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions as they came up
1,24-11-2022,waste of time and money  cert  in allied health assistance,they don't mark your assessments on time they don't answer your emails on time the links to the videos on the content are for the most part unavailable and i even got marked down on an assignment for using a term that was in their own course material that they claim the term was outdatedon their own materialthen they give you no help what so ever in getting work placement even when i work in a hospital and have a willing supervisor they don't have the proper approvals to cover me in a government hospital so then have told me to wait m read moreonths for the approvals to come through that i'm paying for with no extension or to go find another location when i have done everything they asked for to get my work placement they put the blame back on me when they are found to be incompetent do not for any reason give these people money
1,22-11-2022,zero stars if possible great at lying take your money and run the other way,i started the diploma in social media marketing in  as i was really interested in the field when i spoke to troy about signing up i remember on the phone he mentioned that if i wasn't enjoying the particular course or my interests changed i could transfer to a different one but continue paying the original course amount however this was a lie as i was told i cannot do thisin  i started to feel the course was boring it was not challenging and it was all very simple learning i learn best with a challenge and this just did not o read moreffer that the information was basic the videos were boring and overall it was just a simple course did not feel like a diploma and i was not enjoying it i originally asked if i could cancel my course and pay out some sort of fees for cancelling i explained my situation and how i found the course boring and to quote their very words from vanita sometimes students ask to transfer because they find the course difficult or have fallen behind due to personal issues we understand that online study can be challenging at times and it takes dedication and determination to stay motivated  i found this response extremely offensive especially after i explained my reasoning and they were to say my determination was lacking basically when that was not true i know how to study online as i completed majority of my high school and all of my vce via distance education so i know the drill to online learningafter many emails back and forth i eventually got them to cancel my course and pay a very small fee i ran for the hills after this and i will never study with open colleges againtheir administration team are very offensive robotic and have no sympathy for any of their students they take your money and make it extremely hard to get out of it even when larger universities and colleges allow you to change subjects what makes open colleges different pathetic company do yourself a favour and do not study with them
1,10-11-2022,liesno compassion or empathy,studying for monthsone phone call  messagespersonal circumstances changed which impeded my ability to study special considerations have no compassion or empathy for their students got changed  to cancel course for my limited contact with trainers also found out that course is being updated which they knew before i signed on and i get told they can't validate my diploma unless i finish earlywhat a joke  money grabbing scheme with no help from anyone
1,02-11-2022,rip off and unsupporting,i was only online using the course for  months  i have not been back on since december last year which they have access toafter weeks of attempting to cancel the course due to extreme personal circumstances  i was finally permitted to end the course  but have now been charged a fee of  to exit  absolute greed mungers  do not sign up
4,29-10-2022,makes learning possible,the course is not difficultcourse material is not self explanatory but assistance is available
1,28-10-2022,avoid at all costs,i'm still scarred from my experience of opencolleges and tell everyone i possibly can to stay awayi was doing my cert in dental nursing and it was a nightmare from the start the content was just links to  youtube videos and incredibly broad and poorly detailed information on the subject for the first month i spent more time on google looking up subject matters to get clarification than the content open colleges supplied they mentioned on their information page that they help you get placements as it's a requirement for the course so whe read moren i requested help for placements the answer i received from the person over the phone was 'we don't help you get placements but instead you give us the names and contact information of the businesses you've been to who've rejected the placement request and we'll keep hassling them on your behalf until they let you in' great support give my name a bad reputation harass businesses and call that help i lost my job and ended up in a pretty serious mental health state due to my mother receiving a cancer diagnosis so i decided it was in my best interest to withdraw form the course through the 'financial hardship and special considerations' pathway in this option it states that you need a letter from you doctor describing the mental health issues you're having and why it's necessary for me to withdraw i ended up getting three different medical certificates from my doctor including the medications i was taking incredibly violating to request that information and each time they rejected the letters saying there wasn't enough detail and even suggesting that the letters were fraudulent when i told the woman over the phone that the accusations and process was becoming so stressful that it was causing me to have suicidal thoughts she said 'that's not my problem' which yeah i get it's not your problem but have a heart i had to pay for the whole course because opencolleges ignored my requests and barely responded or answers my calls unless i hounded them constantlyavoid avoid avoid go somewhere else i still shocked they're running with the amount of bad reviews and lawsuits they've received i've moved on from the experience and i'm happy and healthy but i will always alert people about how terrible this place is
5,27-10-2022,the experience is worthwhile,initially i was pretty overwhelmed with all the course content but i came across the assessment walkthroughs that helped me put course theory into practicalthe diploma is amazing and i would recommend open colleges to anyone that is seeking to move ahead in their career progression or even seeking on job training the online learning although may seem daunting is actually quite easy and very well supported by the trainers
1,27-10-2022,dishonest and not very upfront of cancelation fees unethical business practices a big trap to take your money,disappointed and will never accept call from sale person fake enrollment officer to discuss about the cancellation and refund  before  months refund is load of crap  unethical business practices first time to know this trashy business exist in australia after  days in the course they ask you to give  of course payment to exit according to their condition
5,26-10-2022,what an experience,i cannot believe that i have just completed my first course in australia the road has been long but the feeling of completing it is so satisfying i did this course because i wanted to pursue a career in community services and earn more money but i have learned a lot about myself and others my relationship with the people around me has improved because of this course thanks to my trainer rosan who ensured that i understand each module through walkthroughs videos and audios repetition and examples
1,24-10-2022,horticulture cert ii what a joke,if i could rate a  i wouldi needed a break from my usual after been burnt out from my last job i feel in love with plants and thought doing this course would be greatits been months of helli live in vic and spent months and months on end in lockdown making it hard to do assignments and complete the coursework not once was this acknowledged by the trainers or staff at open colleges not until a few months ago but thats a few months to latethe cost stress and absurd work load has been enough to send my mental health sky r read moreocking the service and trainers are appalling i can never book a time with trainees because of their limited time frames and some of us work i studied a diploma in youth work and this doesnt come close to the piles and piles of absurd demands from there workload even after they finally assisted and gave me an course extension its to late i still dont know if im going to get it done  and honestly i havent felt like such a failure than how this course has made me feel
5,24-10-2022,i had  great experience learning under my trainer dorina i did certificate iii in dental nurse,i am very satisfied with the course i did with open college i had a very helpful trainer her name is dorina she makes herself available for all her students anytime she has so much patience and understanding to her students i enjoyed learning under her
5,19-10-2022,completing diploma of community services through opencolleges,i was firstly concerned about doing a course online but i can't recommend opencolleges enough you are very supported in your studies and help you in any way they can i was worried i didn't have the time to study with  young children but i was wrong i completed my course before the  year timeframe easy thanks emily ellis
5,19-10-2022,months well spent,i was absolutely satisfied got the right support needed while doing my coursethe college is very supportive for wmoen with childrenthe long road is come to an endit is very rewarding as i already got a job in case management at near completion of my course
4,18-10-2022,my diploma of community services experience,when i looked at studying i saw a diploma of community services and thought whats that i cannot believe that i went from not knowing what community services was to now graduating with a diploma in it i just want to encourage future students especially those who are contemplating doing this or are already doing it dont give up i experienced a lot of set backs during my studies pandemic health issues difficulty finding placement all whilst caring for my two young children with disabilities i felt like giving up at one stage but a read morell it took was one person to say they believed in me well i believe in you i went from being a stayathome mum for years to now a graduate working in the industry as a team leader the biggest reward from all of this is seeing my childrens faces light up when telling others that my mum helps people for work i want to do mums job when i am older this has changed not only my life but my childrens thank you open colleges  especially rosan
5,17-10-2022,months of a lifetime experience and skills,it was definitely a roller coaster due to covid and personal commitments  coming from a different background and different perspective on diversity i am happy to say i am grateful for the opportunity it was a very rewarding experience especially during the workplacement a life long experience and a fortune if skills
4,11-10-2022,diploma of community services,this was such a long but amazing journey for me i wanted to give up so many times but my teacher supported me along the way sent me helpful materials etc
5,10-10-2022,open colleges diploma of community services,i have nearly completed my diploma and am really happy with all the hard work i put ini am a single mum on low income in my 's and found it really challenging during covid lockdowns i didn't realize how capable i was until now i did find in the beginning that i was not sure if i would complete the course but persevered  i have gained a lot of knowledge and cannot wait to get out into the workforce and utilize my skills i found it difficult to get work placement but once i reached out to oc they supported me and helped me find an amazing read more place here i learnt so much about myself and others  placement hours are only  and it went really quick the course notes and assessments are pretty selfexplanatory the walkthrough webinars are brilliant as rosan really explains how to go about the assessments quite clearly i recommend oc for anyone  thank you
2,06-10-2022,disappointed with lack of support in passing the course,i enrolled for the certificate  veterinary nursing course twice because the first time i couldn't complete the work placement due to debilitating illness i had paid upfront and could not get any refunds even though i had evidence of my medical issues i tried again a few years later and paid the full fees again and was so determined to finish the course i worked my butt off through the mountains of theory and assessments and unpaid work placement in clinics but burned out about  quarters of the way throughit is too much work to do all read more on your own with no support i did placement in  clinics one used me for unpaid labour then fired me to hire a qualified nurse and the other clinic hired me as a trainee vet nurse stuck me on reception and banned me from accessing any equipment in the hospital area to do my assessment training then covid hit and i could not find placement in another clinic my course expired and by that stage i had lost so much confidence in ever finishing the course that i didn't pay the extension fee the student support was unhelpful and i had no support from the clinic i was in and it all felt impossible i called today to try and resume where i left off and was informed that the course had been discontinued and i cannot complete it what a waste of time and effort and such a waste of money i am so disappointed and still unqualified and now cannot even finish the course i do not recommend this college at all they'll take your money but are not invested in you completing the course at all my feeling is they discontinued the vet nursing course because of the low completion rate
4,04-10-2022,pleasantly surprised,i was very satisfied with the assortment of topics covered in the community services diploma and it provided a good overview of the industry i would recommend they add additional information regarding law proceedings which many community members face but there was a plethora of information specific to counselling methods start early on applying for work placement left mine till the last minute and it was stressful
5,04-10-2022,open collages,i was very satisfied with the open collages course i found it easy to use and complete
1,02-10-2022,buyer beware,this college in my experience has been exceptionally disappointing they have a great sales team so you feel the experience will be positive but sadly is is not the online content is basic and does not provide very much of the required information for assessments some of the links in the online learning and also in the assessments are broken  assessor response time takes more then  days you would get conflicting feedback if you had different assessors one would tell you an answer is correct and another would tell you it wasn't and make y read moreou resubmit if you did not meet satisfactory marks you had to pay extra to resubmit which they only stated after you signed up one assessor repeatedly issues resubmit grades and did not provide assistance when asked to do so any support is offered by student support who are just administration and have no industry experience
1,01-10-2022,beware of the costs when they dont assess your content on time,my daughter started a animal studies course beware the extra costs that they charge due to lack of assessors to assess the work and things out of your control
4,28-09-2022,certificate level course,i found throughout that the course that the assessors were very prompt in marking and returning my submitted work  appreciated the feedback given on work i submitted from the assessors  the course material was what i would expect from a certificate level course  the pandemic and lockdowns made placement harder to access and having a job quite tricky
1,26-09-2022,disgusted with service,absolutely digusted with oc they so quick to take your money i requested to terminate my course just after the  day period when i  was advised it was  days and they wanted to take  of the course fee i haven't even started the coursewhen i sent an email and left a voice mail message and no one bothered to respond or return my call when i got a hold of someone they very rude and arrogantnow i've been advised i need to put a complaint form  can't even speak to anyone about it to make matters worse i put a complaint in via email as that's the only option and as if things are not bad enough the process can take up to  business days do not go with open colleges
1,22-09-2022,this organisation is such a scam  don't waste your time and money,the assessments are very unfairly marked and then you will be asked to pay a fee to resubmit some of the course content is over a decade old and is no longer relevant at all the majority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist there are spelling mistakes in every second paragraph they did not even bother to run a spell check before publishing the course student support is close to nonexistent you will be waiting several weeks for a reply to an inquiry this organisation only cares about attempting to milk as much money as they possibly can from students
1,08-09-2022,sent to debt collector without supplying proof of payment,i was provided a final notice for an amount  months after i cancelled my course i requested proof of payment i was told they had reviewed a telephone conversation where i had told them i had not cancelled i disagreed and requested proof including a transcript of the conversation i requested over an  months period no response was given and my email and phone were blocked i have now been sent to a debt collector still without proof of the required payment  it is clear that it is a scam for money
1,07-09-2022,this never ends,i lost my job within the  month period and repeatedly tried to cancel but never got a response went through special considerations for financial hardship and was told it would be cancelled as i didnt want a refund of the payments already made and havent accessed the content for a year now today receive a debt collection bill not just for my own bill but also someone elses  a serious breach of the privacy act in sending someone elses personal details and financial information
2,06-09-2022,please save your money and time,this college in my experience is such a scam assessor response time takes more then  days for each and everything i had to call student support over and over again which was no help at all finding placement was such a challenge and zero support provided by the college choosing open colleges was such a waste of  years i would not recommend it to any one please save you money and go via tafe if you can all i had to do was pay for extension over extensionthe study material was very basic if i learned anything was via the placement read moreand from the support of my placement supervisor its been nearly over  weeks since i have submitted my portfolio and have no heard back regarding the certificate i still have to keep contacting student support with no outcomeedit after getting in touch with the team of open colleges from here my issues was resolved within a dayi would like to thanks to the person who speed up the process soon as i messaged them form here
5,05-09-2022,well worth it,the assistance i got from my assessor was fantastic she always responded to every question and concern and got me through the course
4,31-08-2022,the beautiful experience to study through oc,the support i received fro oc was amazing and the trainers were fantastic everytime you have a question or anything cannot get through they have been there to support for me being a mom of  kids and part time worker as a carer to put myself through oc to achieve a diploma is a mile stone and if you believe in yourself and put your mind to it you can move the mountains easily rosan you have been the rock on mu studies thank you for all the support from the oc team
1,30-08-2022,waste of time and of money,i did my part and finished  months ago but i still have no certificate my trainer vanished didn't do her job nobody contacted me i have to chase them and it takes forever very disappointing
5,30-08-2022,was a saver for a single mum with zero support system,i was very satisfiedvery easy to go through and complete
4,22-08-2022,great experience,i am very satisfied with the teaching and course content i found the course informative and on a scale from one to ten in difficulty a five however i found the placement written instruction quite confusing inconsistent and frustrating
5,19-08-2022,amazing company to study through,i was worried starting an online course as i have had bad experiences in the past but everyone ive made contact with through open colleges have been nothing but amazing and so supportive the feedback is helpful and it keeps you motivated in studying from the beginning call you sign up to submitting and getting my grades i have been very blessed with support tom and nicole are so lovely
5,18-08-2022,great experience,extremely happy i always received help straight away when i asked
1,15-08-2022,poor customer service and delayed certificate,i have been waiting for my certificate for a long time now despite following up and no action no one cares to replies emails i was being told to check my junk mail as an excuse to delay the process i could not talk to the person joshua who was following my case because rozelle didn't see the need for me to do that rozelle made sure i can't talk to anyone i don't trust the college
5,09-08-2022,great experience,i was very satisfied with my overall experience with open collages the assessors were always helpful and replyed to my emails in a timely manner the open collages portal is easy to use and has a sufficient amount of learning materials and walk throughs of each assessment the course seemed a bit over whelming at first but i successfully completed the course with support from my assessor and other students
5,03-08-2022,great course to learn at your own pace,the course wasn't difficult you just need to put the hours in i completed the modules in months and completed the work placement in weeks
4,03-08-2022,great course,i found this course to be practicle realistic  informative having many years of real experiance in management i still found plenty of new learnings throughout the course i am confident it has improved my my management  leadershipmstyle
5,03-08-2022,diploma of community service,i have found the resources and help invaluable  i did work placement and the support was fantastic  video module support amazing assessment walkthroughs a great help  the online platform easy to navigate and help at hand when i needed it  thank you for making this process educational and relevant with up to date resources
1,31-07-2022,do not go with open colleges,the course was repetitive on most questions some links didnt work course content was good but there was one particular tutor who was setting you up to failif you did not meet satisfactory marks you had to pay extra to resubmit which they only stated after you sign up
5,27-07-2022,wonderful support from my assessor,i commenced my diploma in  and have since experienced hurdles i did not expect in my personal lifei started placement in february  and due to unforeseen personal circumstances had to delay it until june open colleges have been nothing but supportive while i have been unable to study and with the hurdles throughout placement they have been very accommodating to issues i was having within my placement organizationmy wpa assessment was much more relaxed and less nerve racking than i thought it would be my assessor provided me with a lot of information and extra knowledge for me to apply in further study and work
1,24-07-2022,terrible company  don't bother go somewhere else,i began my course during the first sets of lockdowns in melbourne throughout my whole course i had only spoken to staff who were rude unhelpful and inconsiderate the staff never offered any solutions to the problems that i had raised due to the lockdowns i was unable to complete the work placement as they say need proof of trying i provided this and they still neglected to help i then had to extend my course under special consideration for this after arguing with multiple people that i shouldn't have to pay extra each month as it was a read more pandemic and financial issues it took me multiple times to submit this and still did not get a response after calling them i found out they didn't reply because i needed to submit an extra documentation to support the lockdowns impacting placement yes no one replied because it needed more documentation for around a month even though multiple staff had seen the email my course had expired in this time as well this was not the first time i had not been responded to as well i spoke to one of the girls there who had told me that and told me the extra document i needed and said i would get a response within  business days i asked her  times to give me an accurate answer of how long i will be waiting and she promised it would be  business days as it is now an active case of course i didn't believe her it was also a long weekend and i understand some people work parttime or had the extra day off so i ended up giving her over a week personal things came up and i could not call before hand but i did try to email i ended up calling them when i got a spare minute and was greeted by a guy who told me she wasn't working and asked what the situation was this guy is the only helpful person in this entire company managers included he processed my whole special extension and gave me an extra month on top of it within  minutes so this girl had  weeks roughly to do what this guy did within  minutes that girl is an accurate representation of all the staff and their work ethic excluding this boy i do have the names of all these staff however i will not name them for privacy reasons after trying for a while to find places for work placement and getting knocked back simply due to being with open colleges i was able to get my workplace to allow me to count my work towards work placement i submitted my claim and was waiting for approval i kept checking and asking for updates and of course no response i knew my course extension was coming to an end only had enough  a bit extra to cover work placement to begin with and applied for special consideration for extra time again as all i'm waiting for is the to approve the workplace well by time i submitted the special consideration i was not longer able to do it there so that month of me waiting could have been used to finish my work placement fully instead of waiting i had sent multiple emails their student support call line was only open during my work times and still no response finally the other day i was able to talk to someone on live chat as my course expired and i have been waiting weeks for a response once again well they told me that they don't do anything about following up on work placement approvals and that its up to the company you are doing it with to accept the one email they send that he said always goes to junk mail firstly thats just lazy but secondly i had sent multiple questions asking about it and again no one could tell me that so again horrible lazy work ethic on the contrary i also did ask my workplace who had no idea about the email i had also asked him for an update on my special extension which he said they no longer do which i believe he is lying or if he is not goes into the horrible company and yet again no one told me this or anything during the time waiting for a response i had asked him for a management contact details and he refused but told me they will be into contact with me which was supposed to be after a few days he also sent me a complaint form to fill out im still waiting for management to email me and yet i don't think they will honestly so save your time and go somewhere else even if it means paying more money because of the staff not wanting to communicate or do anything remotely helpful i am not able to get my certificate and wasted my money here throughout everything i had been nice to them but they don't care how nice or rude you are im not sure if these are the company's policies and procedures or a result of lazy work ethic but either way save your time money and stressalso  it might say nationally recognised but if you are looking to go into a government agency i would look into if it is recognised as it is not in some states even though it says it is i was luckily enough to secure a position in a government role with no qualifications needed however i cannot move up until i complete another diploma of the same course that is recognised to them or a bachelor currently now having to do a lot of other people have had this issue so be careful
5,21-07-2022,felt supported,felt supported during my study all the walkthroughs were really valuable
5,20-07-2022,fantastic course,teaching and content was excellent tutor support was great which has made undertaking the course very enjoyable
1,20-07-2022,inconsiderate and rude,despite me being unable to complete the course due to my childrens medical issues deteriorating dramatically provided them with letters from specialists  they still demanded i pay and threaten me with debt collectors
1,16-07-2022,avoid open college,their marking is so behind educators are resigning when u emailed course coordinator no reply very bad system should be reported to department of education my cohort and other cohort are behind marking for  months they dont care just about money money money
4,13-07-2022,a good flexible educational experience,i originally signed up during the pandemic as i figured there was no better time to start then when forced to stay home and looking for where i wanted to move forward in life due to the nature of being online you definitely need to be self dedicated and it is easy to loose motivation but there are multiple avenues of support should it be required connecting with study buddies booking in faculty phone calls etc throughout my course i have gained full time employment in a job i love very glad i found open colleges and this course
4,05-07-2022,support staff,i completed my diploma this year but needed support to get my rpl approved the team went the extra mile to assist me in getting this process completed for which i am extremely thankful for
1,05-07-2022,never study through them again,not great collage and didnt get much support at all basically did the whole thing on my own and i find i havent learnt very much at all having a deadline that needs extended but there not helping me so i can finish in time
4,30-06-2022,a good educational experience,it was initially hard to get started but the content was shown to be very relevant once i started my work placement and the staff were always very helpful when i had questions or needed support
1,27-06-2022,upsetting,i attempted to study with open colleges when i was  only to become homeless not long after and unable to continue study i messaged my course advisor this and i never heard back from the college i didn't get a refund not that that's the principle but he nor did anyone else contact me after this that was it now at  and looking to study the course again i will not go through open colleges
5,26-06-2022,course review,i found some of the content repetitive and there were a number of links that weren't working some of the questions in assignments were hard to decipher what was being asked however the walkthroughs mostly helped to clarify these issues overall i was happy with the teaching  my assessor rosan was very accessible and got back to me quickly he was supportive and encouraging when i was finding it hard to stay motivated i didn't think the course was difficult
1,25-06-2022,there isnt a  stars option take the average review score and lower by,teaching resources were outdated and not always functionalthe course shouldnt have been difficult but was made more so by the lack of communication phased out modules only given days notice even if half way through inability to ask assessors questions or feedback when a question was answered often weeks later it was nonsensical or didnt address the core query at all or just plain wrong it was a mess and while i obviously dont recommend anyone enrol i would actively try to convince people not to go to tafe
1,19-06-2022,not a great experience,i would not use open colleges again for an online course course content was out of date and insufficient to complete assignments large amounts of independent research was required i found course trainers very difficult to engage with and mostly unhelpful assignments were very lengthy and very unclear in their requirements resulting in many resubmissions i would have expected a lot more interaction with trainers to clarify subject matter and assignment requirements i was told i would require  hours a week of work which i personally found read more insufficient especially with the length of the assignments assignments are not graded as a percentage you are graded as either being satisfactory or unsatisfactory this means that  of your assignment could be correct but a resubmission would be required for a small detail and waiting a further  weeks to be regraded i feel that in such cases mere feedback to provide a better understanding of the topic would suffice
5,16-06-2022,extraordinary trainers and strong student support,through these years i have been struggling to balance my study and lifestyle rosan lal my trainer and assessor has not only supported me in the knowledge learning but he ignites my enthusiasm toward the study until i accomplished it rosan is a very approachable and skilful trainer as a student who is from different cultural background rosan told me not to be selfabasement but be myself also i found the walkthrough rosan downloaded on additional resources very usefulgenerally i would recommend it to anyone who is planning to study community services courses in order to serve in the voluntary groups after graduation alongside strong student support and trainers
5,15-06-2022,fantastic service from teachers,chris was a fabulous teacher who gave so much of his time to me i would  recommend open colleges to anyone who wants the flexibility of studying online with a teacher who is there every step of the way
3,12-06-2022,was a challenging and self independent course,i got my certificate they are not scammers overall it went good and it was challenging it gives you more time to submit your assessment the student support were helpful and available for their students my teacher dorina helped me a lot during the course she motivated me through the course she was really nice just the learning material was really difficult and doesnt even make sense
4,02-06-2022,self paced learning,i struggle with selfpaced learning so this took longer than it should once you factor in life and workthe course coordinator was excellent they were supportive of me when i was having trouble getting this done in a reasonable time frameearlier on in the qualification some of the teachers were a bit slow to respond but the ones i reached out to were helpful
1,31-05-2022,zero support,i waited  weeks for my phone orientation no one ever called the course material is very repitetive and basic i didn't find my teaching involved at allthe qualification at the end is good for nothingwould not recommend open colleges
1,28-05-2022,i am extremely dissatisfied the communication between the support team and students are very slow,difficult due to personal circumstances and would prefer more recorded videos from australian sources i am a visual learner and would prefer the presenter showing recorded journal entries as an example rather than reading
1,25-05-2022,do not go near this place,make sure you read the fine print they are only interested in your money they have no integrity due to unforeseen circumstances it was impossible for me to complete the course i had ample evidence of financial  and medical hardship they ignored all of the evidence and i had to pay k for a k course that i had no access to they are criminals
1,18-05-2022,not helpful,wouldn't recommend studying through open colleges assessors don't check in on students or seem to have empathy emails to student support get ignored also paying for extensions per month is stupid
4,18-05-2022,helpful people and good support system,the course has been very interesting and helpful in my line of work i have learned some key techniques and expertise in providing efficient service delivery my assessor has been very helpful and quick to respond to any questions and the support people have always been willing to help some aspects to the course are difficult but get easy once one understands
1,15-05-2022,do not study with open colleges,use any other online platform rather than open colleges i guarantee you will regret it after a few monthsover priced under supported consistently repeating course workfind any other option
5,12-05-2022,open colleges  diploma community services  online,the assessors have been incredible flexibility was really important to me as i have been able to work fulltime and study part time successfully content and online learning material was great and i found the final observation  assessment in module  hrs to be insightful and enjoyable i will be furthering my studies  psychology but would highly recommend open colleges
4,11-05-2022,great experience with open colleges,studying online was a great experience especially whilst juggling a full time jobi found this course very detailed and challenging but very eye opening and rewarding the assessors and the student support team are a great help whenever you have questions overall i am satisfied with this entire experience
2,10-05-2022,overpriced and little support,i paid over k to do a business administration course with opencolleges i got stuck on one module and didn't have access to the tool needed to complete the assignment i did it using an alternative software but the tutor kept asking me to resubmit and i couldn't complete the rest of the course there was not really any assistance offered waste of time and money
5,10-05-2022,amazing extremely supportive,the teachers and assessors are amazing the wording of the questions were sometimes hard to work out what direction to take and how to answer it and a bit overwhelming
4,09-05-2022,challenging but motivational,studying online has been a great help for me as a mum it is a bit challenging because i have to research some information by myself online but it helped me to learned a whole bunch of real education all modules are easy to learn and understand  my assessors and support team  are very helpful to me even though sometimes i don't get the answer straight away but it always comes overall i am happy and thank you open colleges
4,04-05-2022,fun course to learn,i am very happy with how this course was laid out there is always support available which is amazing and the staff really do care about your learning all the modules were easy to follow and understand there were moments of struggling but overall it was a success to be apart of
1,24-04-2022,warning  do not enrol here,they are very friendly when trying to enrol you into a course absolutely disgusting attitude from advisorsassessors once your course has startedno help and support providednot worth the money these people are only after money
5,22-04-2022,a motivational tool diploma of community services,as a migrant from the pacific islands png it was a big shift to choose open colleges to study online i can say this course i undertook was a real blessing and a great tool in the community setting anywhere in australia the course amazed me with how vast this industry is the course content and layout were easy to follow the updated learning materials and resources plus the work placement done was an eyeopener and have given me the skills and knowledge to confidently explore the variety of services in the community services industry i ca read moren confidently say i am ready to face the real world anywhere in australia with this qualification and experiences attained through my placement the learning platform is amazing with help always on the way to reaching out online learning has been such a great choice with open colleges because life is too busy to be in a classroom setting the support staff are really helpful and supportive every time i needed help all the trainersassessors have been really helpful from the beginning even though sometimes you don't get the answer right away it always comes i can't be thankful enough to all my pacific islander folks if you are reading this please i encourage you to enquire and explore more yourself you won't regret this thank you open colleges
5,22-04-2022,wonderful support for educational experience,as a mature aged person returning to study was very daunting however all the way through the course i was assisted by the tutors when the material did not seem clear and the support and and guidance made the journey very easy the course was well planned and built on the knowledge learned in the earlier parts of the course the range of activities allowed for a variety of learning styles and some extended my skills into areas particularly of it which i had not explored before staff were willing to support this learning journey by giving de read moretailed information and being there when needed i now feel much more secure in using many of these programs in other areas the course also gave me an insight into a variety of programs available to assist in the operation of my business with no bias or implication that one program was better than others thank you to the staff for their support and assistance as i have now achieved a qualification i should have done  years ago
5,18-04-2022,great experience and the supervisors helped a lot,dorina iancu is an amazing and a very professional person who helped during the course with a lot a lot of advises she was always very responsive and there for me

1,13-04-2022,enrol your course eleswhere be warn,my open college experience is the worse firstly open colleges fees are way over priced was charged  for diploma in community service thank god i have a previous degree so i was able to navigate my way though i struggled sometimes if work experience is a prerequisite then the course should make arrange with other service providers for that but they don't do that secondly they bully you to arma debt collection where they charged me  on commission fees wowall the care about is money not pay no attention to students am appalled my this institutiondont study herer
3,13-04-2022,mostly the course was satisfactory,some of the assessments were open to interpretation which made it difficult trying to speak to someone person to person was also difficult not accepting prior time in the job as part of my placement delayed me in obtaining my certificate substantially
1,12-04-2022,don't study with them,don't bother with open colleges i would give lees than  star if i couldmy wife did a course with open colleges they were not helpful throughout the course in the slightest i could go on for a long time but will keep it as short as possiblethe worksheets are extremely unintuitive and the formatting is appalling if the formatting is changed they do not accept the worksheet they are extremely nitpicky with thisthe communication is also extremely poor whether via email or phone the answer to a question will change depending on th read moree person some employees say that specific email addresses need to be used for communication others say there should be no issues and they don't understand why this has been communicated to uswhen doing placement the supervisor that was assigned to my wife was never the one that was contacting her during checkup calls etc the supervisors that did contact her were not very helpful as they would say that they are not assigned to her and could not helpthere is more but not worth it just don't go with open colleges

5,08-04-2022,very happy with my experience,my assessor was wonderful very helpful with assistance and great guidance her correspondence was quick and very efficient i found her teaching skills to be great and she was very approachable and understanding

1,10-03-2022,absolutely disgusting do not give these people your money,i began studying midjan moved past my coolingoffperiod by wks encountered personal and medical struggles contacted special considerations team and i was treated so poorly throughout the entire process  i sent through all the requested correspondence in support of my hardships and was met with a cold apathetic generic email quoting terms and conditions advising that i will be required to pay  of my course fees as a cancellation fee  i then supplied more supportive evidence to appease open college's special consideration criteria read moreand was again denied  this was escalated to their complaints team another form and again denied  i then obtained more supportive documents from my doctor and the complaints team redirected me back to the special consideration team who responded 'approving' my enrollment cancellation but quoting my cancellation fee again and then a separate email requesting my banking details  i called student services who were very empathetic and agreed that this treatment was unacceptable unfortunately these are not the people making decisions but i was told that this matter was above them and i needed to complete the internal appeals process  so to recap student struggling physically emotionally and financially  special consideration form  complaints form  another special consideration form  an appeals form and if unsuccessful  accc or ombudsman complaint process  absolute joke  they will continue to pass very offensive backhanded judgement on your medical conditions they whole wayif you want to study but are  certain you will not come into contact with any personal medical mental health or financial struggles  they might be alright  in my professional hr  business experienced opinion a business that has such tight legal recovery processes with stringent criteria for support or exit strategies where cancellation charges are extravagant and the expectation to scrutinise your extenuating personal circumstances leaving you vulnerable to their discretion there is a reason they have had to create these processes to protect their corporate ass as much as possible and that reason is not in favour of the greater good leave you with nothing but regret

1,15-02-2022,waste of your time and money,this institution treats students nicely to get you to join and does nothing to help afterward the 'assessors' are overpaid and don't properly review your work  they skim it and resend old feedback even with the changes you have made they also are no help when you reach out to them i explained to one assessor that their feedback didn't make any sense to me and asked for them to explain pieces in a different way  the teacher a name removed said his explanations were clear and long so they should make sense that's poor teaching  if a student cannot understand and you refuse to reexplain it how good of a teacher are you they also take frequent leave periods with no notice to allow you to have work submitted with reasonable time

1,05-01-2022,absolute waste of money,if i could give this institution  stars i wouldi took up a course with oc whilst i was working full time in the hopes of transitioning careers realising that i couldnt commit to the studies i paid off the rest of my course remaining incomplete as my full time work was not an acceptable defer explanation once i started maternity leave i decided that id like to resume  extend my course only to be told that because the course specifications had since changed i was no longer considered to be a student and could not be reenrolled into my course nor would any of my prior modules be recognisedtransferred so so so disappointing such a waste of money
1,23-12-2021,terrible no support and no transcript of units completed if you have to withdraw complete waste of money,be aware if you cant finish the course they will not issue a transcript of subjects and units completed  money completely wasted study with a reputable provider no support whatsoever no exit phone call no trainer ever contacted me nil to no support throughout  i advise you contact your local job skills network and seek a provider that can assist you through all aspects of your course

4,14-12-2021,amazing trainers,i am still undertaking the certificate  in building in construction the course has been a lot more work than i expected for a certificate  it has been incredibly hard at times but this is a good thing as it is imperative that the industry produces decently educated peoplei would not have been able to get as far as i have without the amazing efforts of the trainers especially vince russo i am constantly emailing the trainers for direction and advice and have had a couple of phone calls with them too the trainers dedication to educa read moretion and helping students is the single reason this course is doable for someone without prior experience vince has helped me throughout the course to understand things and move forward i do sometimes find the actual assessments to be worded in a confusing way or not explained enough in detail for what is required but again the trainers are always on standby to help whenever neededdefinitely challenging but worth it to learn and understandthanks to all the trainers and vince for helping me this far
5,10-12-2021,this is perfect you can't live without it,i'm very happy that i did this course it's very accurate because all the things that ive learnt throughout the process was exactly what i needed to know about being a dental assistant
4,01-12-2021,amazing and supportive,the teacher dorina was absolutely amazing and so supportive and helpful with any questions the course content was quite easy to understand although i think it needs to be updated as a lot of methods are outdated the course was not to difficult a little challenging in some modules and gave me the skills i needed
1,23-11-2021,its a scam,dont sign up for their course its free youtube videos as classes and when you realise this its too late to quit without paying  percent of the total cost of the course which for me is
5,21-11-2021,great course recommend open colleges to anyone who would like to study,i'm very satisfied with the course certificate  in youth work the course content and the help i received is amazing thank you however i did find the course hard but got a little help from my assessor and she reallyhelped me to understand what to do and how to do the assessment so thank you kindly
5,16-11-2021,extremely satisfying and indepth course,compared with other dental assistant courses this course is much more indepth and comprehensive even the staff at the place of my employment thought that this course was way too far in depth and labourintensive compare to similar courses for other student dental assistance i want to thank teacher darina for all her help assistance and for making the course are much more pleasurable experience and her understanding of where i was that and what i needed to know she was such a pleasure to deal with and her explanations were easy to understand read more i also want to extend my appreciation to the faculty and student support for their understanding during these difficult times due to the virus and the issues it was causing in regards to delays in completing my course and to finding a suitable place to finish my course practicaleven though the course was indepth it gave me a better knowledge base and understanding plus prepared me for my role as a dental assistant the only negative i can find with the course is the lag time between submitting work and getting feedback on what i needed to correct or if i could start another section of my course sometimes a month would go by without any feedback at allthe one big positive as english is not my first language was my teachers ability to be able to keep things simple for me when she was explaining what i needed to do or what was required by me once again thank you teacher darina you made the course more pleasurable and an easier learning experiencea big thank you to the faculty and student support for also allowing me to extend several times as without these extensions i would also have not of been able to complete the course due to the virus and my workload at the dental clinicas a final comment if anyone wants to learn every aspect of being a dental assistant then this course definitely prepares you for it and thank you to the college for that
4,16-11-2021,certificate iii  iv accounting and bookkeeping,it was definitely a lot more involved than i anticipated having done a bookkeeping course many years ago i found the bookkeeping and accounting elements a wonderful refresher it gave me the opportunity to use things i don't often use such as powerpoint presentations computerised accounting software  and videoaudio recordings some modules i found much easier than others the most challenging was module  overall i was quite satisfied with the course and very happy with the trainersassessors
5,15-11-2021,certificate iii in dental assisting,my assessor dorina iancu was very professional and helpful i was very satisfied with her teaching and guidance the course was not overly difficult but lots of assessment writing is required which is good
1,15-11-2021,only get back to you to sign you up then that's it,go else where i don't know how many times i have emailed saying the same issueover and over again get passed to everyone to still not have issue solved
4,14-11-2021,love the course it is so exciting and i am learning so much,the course content is really amazing intelligent insightful and inspiring student support are very helpful encouraging and have the know howas i am not very good with the computer i would have preferred a little more information before submitting assignments on how to properly submit simple things like  write your responses on the assessment page then upload instead of wiring as a separate word document also the course materials sometimes i print out for future record and would love if the notes were numbered also an outline of what is expected of us regarding referencing before course begins discovering the online student portal to ask questions on the spot was very helpful
4,14-11-2021,online study,the teachers and support staff are great  course content is slightly repetitive  most of the content is relevant to leisure and health workers  it is challenging and very timeconsuming  but worthwhile doing the course
3,12-11-2021,support was good course content ok,support the teachers and other support were goodcourse content sometimes a bit repetitive similar reading material and assignment requirements it needs to make all assignments in a clear uniform format this was the part that made me more frustrating to format the assignment the support material needs to be updated
5,11-11-2021,good structure of online study platform,if you are looking for an online course that suits your type of studying needs i would recommend open colleges like myself i have a family and kids to juggle time and this type of studying platform suits me very wellhow difficult was this certificate iii course in dental assisting in any given course it takes hard work and dedication to finish it challenges may come along the way but focus and determination will help you through it try to research and understand this type of online studying to make sure that this online platform does read morework for you i can only speak from my experience and view all i can say is they have a good structure of curriculum for this course their online interface if user friendly the assessor is very supportive and response well with all the email queries promptly the support team gets back to you if you have any concerns im happy to have finished this course ahead of the course time frame not only because of diligently working hard on it but also with help and motivation of their assessor dorina i hope i have inspired others to try to study with open colleges and your hard work will all pay off at the end cheers
5,10-11-2021,this is very informative well supported through out,i was very satisfied with the teaching and course content i received a lot of support and i felt that what we went through was very relevant to the study that i was undertakingit was challenging
4,05-11-2021,loved studying with open colleges,loved it i hadn't studied for many years the platform is so easy to use and i felt supported by rosan very well my assessments and questions were answered promptly
1,02-11-2021,warningread me,if you are considering applying to open colleges i would please urge you to take the time to read my reviewi have been a student at open colleges i have completed a diploma of community services and certificate iv in disability i have also been to a reputable education provider the university of technology sydney  where i completed a bachelor of nursing with distinctionthe staff are very happy to accept you into their courses they are more than happy to accept payments for courses also however when you are enrolled the course coo read morerdinators or lecturers if you can call them that rarely respond in a timely manor combined with this the learning content is very vague there is no prescribed textbook i rarely saw material referenced which made me do some digging whereby i found a majority of their data was and if not all was taken from aspire manuals whereby they have bastardised or rewritten it for the most part to suit their needs very poorly and might i add the aspire manuals give greater depth and learning than their open college counterpartsmuch if not all of that information that is conveyed to students will be required to be responded via many links and comments sections throughout the content this learning is further consolidated through assessments these assessments are a combination of both quizzes and written assignments  they do not allow any margin of error which has led to many of my quizzes  causing a  hour lock out to repeat quizzes assignments  taking weeks to mark should errors be identified assessors provide very limited or basic feedback that often left me more confused than it being marked prior i thought it would also be prudent to mention here that open colleges has recently introduced a  fee for remarking assessments  which is ridiculous considering they have already been paid as part of the purchase price for the course in the first placethis brings me to the work placement componentsi have had many conflicts with open colleges in the past they have refused to recognise work place learning when i have worked in nursingdisability they have workplace portfolios that are very very large that take an enormous amount of time to complete the workplace portfolios often are sent backwards and forwards to students  due to errors that can take months to complete work placements are required to be located by students this is a cause for great distress for many students there are many forums that exist whereby students have all but given up on finding a placement which begs me to question  if they have already had a number of students that have completed their qualificationswould they not have a list of workplaces that students could contact alas no this is not the case i can attest to this fact having being enrolled in another two open colleges courses certificate iv in youth work along with the certificate iv in alcohol and other drugscertificate iv in mental health  both that disappeared off my profile and subsequently told by open colleges that my work was for nothing following not completing the course within their timeframe  yes open colleges this is due to the vast proportion of australian businesses that refuse to admit your students to their workplaces this does not come at a surprise considering much of the content is basically rewritten from an aspire manual and has little to no referred or referenced source for the location of the content and where it is coming from
1,01-11-2021,worst study experience ever,from administration to content to feedback and support this has been the worst experience  that goes beyond anything i could have imagined i would hate for anyone else i know to have to experience this so please i urge you to stay away from this online institute
5,01-11-2021,overall a good experience,i have received excellent support from open colleges right throughout my certificate iv for mental health the student support team have been amazing at resolving my queries and the assessors have been extremely responsive
5,28-10-2021,sooo glad i applied,content was great  help and guidance was always available by both support staff and the trainersassessor  so proud of myself for taking the leap  the team were amazing with answering any questions i had and the communication was amazing  i have no regrets  thanks to them i am now in my dream career thank you
1,28-10-2021,don't sign up with open colleges  go to a different provider,i signed a payment instalment agreement with open colleges it has been brought to light that they made an error and now they are saying i need to pay the full amount not what i agreed to open colleges keep referring me to my agreement with them but amazingly the payment instalment agreement they are saying doesn't matter and i have to pay what they tell me i have advised open colleges they cant do that they need to honour the payment instalment but they are saying they don't have to because it doesn't match what the course fee should be th read moree cancellationrefund and complaints only benefit open colleges there needs to be a class action against open colleges please if there is a lawyer reading this please act on our behalf  open colleges cant keep doing this ro people
1,28-10-2021,do not recommend,zero stars would be a better reflection of my experience with this rto student support is non existent  hours on hold when trying to call nil response to emails modules locked on the student portal when they should be unlocked for completion   do not recommend
5,27-10-2021,student support through open colleges,highly recommend reaching out to student support when needed assessors have been great and get back to you very quickly with any questions or support needed over all had a great experience studying with open colleges
4,27-10-2021,amazing,open colleges were great with me very understanding that i needed more time to complete my course due to covid and the assessor were always there to help and rely quickly
1,25-10-2021,uncaring difficult waste of money,my husband paid in full for his course and applied for a refund  months in after i had a stroke requiring him to be my full time carer as it was obvious he would be unable to complete it due to looking after me he did ask for an extension but was told it was too early  after supplying a dr certificate stating as such we were advised we didn't provide enough evidence what the hell else do you need my brain bleed scans so too be bad so sad but we will give you an extension no special consideration normal refund rules apply thanks for nothing open universitiesword of advice do not pay in advance
1,22-10-2021,such a terrible college,i completed a cert iii in individual support and never received my qualifications the only time they will contact you is for money  im disgusted and furious with this college will never attend ever again i dont recommend this college to anyone also i had work placement and my facilitator only showed up once during the  whole weeks  other people noticed how un professional she was it was appalling and embarrassing
4,22-10-2021,a self motivated online study a great challenge very happy with my results and support from open college,it is indeed a very indepth course education assistant cert iii  you have to be very selfmotivated to study online and be committed to spend at least    hours per week  i did enjoy the course and looking forward to work at the primary school  the assessors and student support was great with support and assistance during my study time and they do explain each module in the webinar's
1,21-10-2021,charge you full price despite not logging in,never logged on never completed any course work  charged in full never again they just want your money couldnt care less if you actually study total rip off beware
4,19-10-2021,rising to the challenge,the diploma of community services is just the challenge that i needed to spark my motivation to learn it is very indepth and requires a fair amount of selfstudy and research to complete the assignments the staff are very helpful and offer support in a variety of ways it took me longer to complete than i planned due to the pandemic making it challenging to find work placement but once i got that it energized me to complete the course
1,18-10-2021,i was left at such a disadvantage,i have just cancelled my youth work diploma with open college  what a disappointment halfway through my studies the assesses and the platform itself has sent me back six months of   one assessment needing to bere submitted  times and in four different colours like you were in kindergartenif you are serious about up skilling and making a difference in your career  shop around and further your studies somewhere elsewhen speaking to the careers officer she added no help or any assistance of value expect for a massive cancellation fee not only did i get disadvantaged via a non response via emails when i did get a response there was no direction from your teachers or any student support what a rip off of course
5,13-10-2021,that was a fantastic experience that i had with open collage,doing this course was my excellent experience notes was very clear and understandable teachers are very responsive and the students support online team also was very responsive and on time replier
5,13-10-2021,rosan lal,excellent teaching and mentoring by mrrosan lal throughout the coursecourse content were excellent this course helped me to get a team leader job in disabilityi am extremely thankful to everyone who helped me out
4,12-10-2021,great course,good communication with students and assessorsrelevant documents and easily navigatedthe course feedback is good but not super constructive but it gives a good view of what you need to work on
3,10-10-2021,bare minimum,i was satisfied with the course content but the support from the assessors was not very goodnot once during the whole course did anyone contact me to offer academic help its fine for student support to email you generic encouragement and help with non academic issues it also a good feature having the chat support option however i couldn't tell you any of the assessors names or what they sound like because not one of them has ever contacted me unless i initiated it wee they did get back to me it was always an email a week later that didn't read more really help with my academic question a question a quick phone call could have resolvedi accept they are busy people and have a lot of students and marking to do but there is no doubt that students should be getting a call from faculty on occasion to discuss the course they are doing
5,07-10-2021,a good experience,the course was relevant useful informative and educational well structured with clear guidelines course  material was relevant most trainers were helpful with quick feedback given clearlyi would recommend this course to others as open colleges delivered as promised
5,07-10-2021,certificate  in mental health plus aod,i really enjoyed the course and found the content to be thorough and informative there was definite challenge with the assessments and practical tasks alot of information was presented in an interesting way i loved it
4,06-10-2021,keep up the good work,it was perfect for me as i work full time and a mother of  did not like the video part some bits i found hard but other bit were easy
1,06-10-2021,i wish i did proper research,i am currently doing a diploma of human resources management and i really wished i did my research or read the reviews before signing up and paying x amount of money for this the material itself is all theory with minimal interactive learning activities you do not hear from open college and reaching for support is minimal just the generic responses some assessors take up to  weeks to mark your assessments the assessments contain questions that are not clear the assessments also contain multiple components that can take up to weeks to do read more also they make you resubmit the entire assessment if you miss out on a tiny little part that is technically irrelevant i've now had to request to extend my course and each time i have to extend month by month and waiting for approval are you kidding me i am paying for it ridiculous they don't take into consideration you working full time and that you are experiencing a pandemic in vic longest lockdown in the world and that may take a toll on your mental health and so there may be a lack in motivation to study instead they request for a doc certificate i'm an adult and understand my responsibilities however i signed up without anticipating a pandemic my advice would be to take into consideration your time if you work fulltime this may not be the right course or academic avenue also if you are more of a hands on learner then definitely not i am now aiming to get this diploma and get the hell out of here
5,05-10-2021,diploma of social media and marketing,an amazing process from finding the right course up until graduating thankyou open colleges for the great experience and support throughout my studies i look forward to studying with you in the future and will recommend you to friends and familythanks again

1,16-09-2021,find another learning provider,one star for the good educators and the customer service reps there besides thatlong waiting times for assessments to be markedtons of spelling mistakes and typos on the learning materialsthey say you can defer your studies for up to  months but then claim it does not apply to online learningthey will give you extensions as long as you keep paying the fees even when you have explained your financial situation is not the best at the momentmost importantly if you decide to stop the course it doesn't matter how many units you completed i completed  out of  if you don't do the practical part of the course which is one unit your completed units don't count and you won't get a transcriptstay away from this provider

1,13-09-2021,beware and read the older reviews,beware and read the older reviews they are currently promoting students to write positive but the overall experience is more inline with two weeks ago the company is all about making money and does not care about you and you learning experience with so many providers on the market i advise you to go elsewhere
5,10-09-2021,dental assistant,dorina iancu is an amazing educator exceptional and has a clear message as a assessor very knowledgeable and encouraging supportive when needed to be intuitive informative takes time to be specific with every single student i have studied a lot of courses and find open space colleges has the best online course the structure and how it is delivered i still can't get my head around it because it's so intelligent the question of how difficult did you think this course was although at the same time it's so clever in the way the presentation ha read mores been formatted there is a lot of content simplified to make it so clear to understand for the students  nothing is easy this is a life changing experience for me and the support staff extremely helpful professional warm and friendly  i still have a long way to go but loving every step i am taking towards a career as a dental assistant

4,07-09-2021,university open college,i was very satisfied with the teaching course content the teacher was very helpful when questions were put to himi found the couse was just right in its difficulty
2,07-09-2021,poor response to enquiry,courses unsuitable for school based senior high school students the advisor who  spoke with me was completely clueless about the australian education system did not listen to my questions and had a poor attitude taking my money elsewhere
5,06-09-2021,certificate iv in webbased technologies,i'm more than happy to have found this course the good points it was well structured it gets increasingly harder as we go deeper and i think that's how it should be the student gets to be more independent and selfreliant i believe it is expected that one becomes so although we are told that it may take  days for assignments to be marked i never had to wait anywhere near that long  the feedbacks are fair and i completely loved the suggestions the teachers gave me to help me improve and make my assignments more comprehensive and of cou read morerse they give you an opportunity to redo and to test your understanding  longdistance study is a challenge in itself the selfdiscipline to keep your study time intact away from work and from family demands can be at times overwhelming but open colleges offered help tools suggestions and guidance and i'm very grateful for that i also had to suspend my studies at one point in order to meet work demands outside my regular hours of work and to extend it a couple of times when i fell behind and i had nothing but support to do that  the notsogood points the only things i could point here is that at times some links to references were broken and some spelling mistakes however they were far too few of them to stop anyone from understanding the context of the articles and nothing to stop you from googling it yourself nor asking the teacher to clarify it if it came to thati loved this course and i fully recommend it if you want an entry point into the digital world
1,05-09-2021,the worst of the worst,i cant even begin to describe the thieves that run this shabby institution they are so shady in their dealings and students shouldnt go near themterrible terrible experiencedo not be duped

1,31-08-2021,zero starsdo not enrol do not sign up do not give them any money,i cancelled my enrolment  hours after enrolling as i read the reviewsi had zero contact from them in regard to the status of my refundi had to call them every  days for  weeks to check and each time i was told some story about not being able to contact the finance department and hence unable to assist me further appalling customer service miserable assistance it was only after i told them i had lodged a complaint with the department of fair trading and that i had contacted my solicitor did i get my refund  weeks after cancelling read morei wouldn't have minded the lateness of my refund the say it takes  days if someone had been straight with me and actually had communicated clearly with me at any point i shudder to think what studying here is like after reading the reviews and my own experience i am so glad i withdrew stay away from here
5,27-08-2021,wonderful and supportive,the course content is plain and simple and easy to follow the module system works well for methe course whole challenging was a great way for me to learn and gain knowledge of the ech industry
1,26-08-2021,save your money and go elsewhere,the most annoying assessors and the structure of the course was the worst thing about it soo pointless and i am already in the industry of what i was studying my diploma of even people that i work with have said this stuff is pointless and the structure is ridiculous i hate the marking and honestly everything about it is annoying i get so agitated thinking about it  week waiting time for marking are you serious i need the completion asap sooo frustrating go elsewhere
5,26-08-2021,support staff are excellent,the support staff were amazing after some personal troubles that pushed back my studies they granted me  months free extension to allow me time to catch up they were kind and understanding i have enjoyed the freedom of doing my studies selfpaced and online with open colleges
1,18-08-2021,waste of time and money,i tried to contact the trainers and staff for assistance with multiple assessments and heard nothing back from them only to find out their accounts were deactivated the other students within the course were struggling to even find assistance and one ended up messaging me outside of the opencolleges hub to tell me they are cancelling their course due to lack of help from the socalled trainers they lack any sort of professionalism and do not help out the students they are an institution only looking for your money and nothing else expecti read moreng you to understand concepts without their added assistance a horrible place to study and if there is tafe or university options available i would highly recommend i have since been studying at university since i cancelled the course and i have found the learning experience immensely better than what was offered at opencolleges you can actually talk to staff and ask for assistance plus build relationships with fellow students more frequently rather than the once in a blue moon reachout you might find in this absolute joke of an institution they are a scam masquerading as a place of learning do not buy courses from here
1,17-08-2021,absolutely disgusted,i am absolutely disgusted in these people i had a really bad injury in which prevented me from being able to complete my course  i then had to organise special consideration in which to their credit it was granted and a payment freeze was organised however i have since decided to withdraw from the course as i didnt enjoy it anymore and i sent multiple emails and tried to call to get withdrawn from this course and got no response instead they kept charging me im not at the stage of trying to organise a payment plan as theyre trying to make me pay the entire cost of the course
1,11-08-2021,stay away extortion at it's worse,beware special consideration team is a complete waste of time they will extort everything and anything out of you a complete and utter rip off you can get this same course for  as apposed to their
1,10-08-2021,only cares for money,i ordinally signed up to open colleges as i thought it would be a great way to get the qualification i needed in a short time period instead of a few years but i was wrong since the beginning open colleges has not been helpful at all i am currently in the process of leaving the course with them and personally feel i should not have to pay the ridiculous amount of money needed to be paid on a 'cancellation fee' they only care about money if i am leaving due to them being inconsistent and un helpful i feel nothing should be paid no consideration whatsoever
1,05-08-2021,do not they do not care about you your profession or your life they just care about money,they seriously have no consideration for what people go through my situation changed and i fell into some medical troubles they demanded and defaulted it to debt collectors oc  garbage
1,04-08-2021,scammers,if i could give them  stars i'm on disability pension and cant afford   because of heath reasons  i couldn't finish course unfortunately and said to them that could keep the money that i have already payed because of medical issues they said i would to go threw special consideration team so i sent email they said would get back in  then the special consideration team said i have get medical certificate  from my doctor so i did that then the women special consideration team said wasn't good enough so i ended going to lawyer such lovely m read morean they said him i have get doctor certificate saying how long i have had epilepsy what type of medication how times i take my medication and had proof that in the disability pension so i got the medical certificate with thing they needed and i gave them proof that i'm on the disability   pension and then after getting all that the prove they wanted they still said i have pay the amount and when comes getting  assessments marked it took them forever to mark my assessments worse company for studying
1,30-07-2021,scammers,if i could give them  stars i would i recently enrolled with them at the beginning of july after the cooling off period had ended my state had gone into lockdown and my work had stopped giving me shifts i had troubles claiming the covid disaster payment from centrelink so i basically had no way of paying my coursei first emailed the consultant who enrolled me into the course asking how can i discontinue my course i received no reply to my emaili called student support and the lady i spoke to  was actually really kind and unders read moretanding of my situation she mentioned she couldnt do anything on her end but had mentioned that i could apply for special consideration with documentation as proof i filled out the form i made it clear i had received no shifts by providing my rosters for the past  weeks since my enrolment due to the lockdown in my state i also included a screenshot of my manager texting me saying my shift was cancelled the day before of my shift  with the date and time shown i mentioned i didnt want any refund and to cancel without any fee however the person who was handling my case had no sympathy at all he said i would still need to pay the remaining fee of  the only options i was given was to pay  a fortnight or defer paying this off for  months apparently loss of work hours or termination of employment is not a reasonable excuse  even during the tough times that we are in i havent even completed any parts of the course i dont understand how they still expect me to pay that amount when i have no shifts because of this covid lockdown
1,26-07-2021,charge on rd attempt of assignment,was happy with the course until they started the  charge on your third attempt on an assignment the information given by the assessors when you hand it up is never useful and the assignments themselves are written poorly so it's easy to make mistakes technical issues go with the online experience as well so this just adds to the problem we are currently in a pandemic so money is a problem for everyone so i can't see how they could think it's acceptable to start charging people money for simply making mistakes we are here to learn not pay
1,23-07-2021,ponzi scheme for money,stay away from them they do not care about anything except for money there is no student support and course i was enrolled in was poorly structured they have good marketing team and they are at the top when you search for courses but after that their courses are not even recognised
2,19-07-2021,lack of support,the questions for the assessments are worded poorly and most dont make much sense the course material is made up of a lot of external links that dont work i spoke with other students that were having the same problems too it takes  days for tutors and assessors to reply to questions regarding the assessments and the answers are usually just as poorly worded do not study with opencolleges if you think youll need ongoing and consistent support
1,15-07-2021,my life is destroyed,my experience with open colleges has caused me to stop trusting people i filled out the first part of the online form and provided my phone number after i clicked submit i saw the second part of the form and decided that the institution wasnt for me i closed the tab thinking that they would not have my number since i only filled out the first part of the form they have not let me live my life in peace since then every few days i get a phone call from them i have told them several times very bluntly that i am not interested and no read moret a dollar sign i block the number and they use a different number next time stalking me like this when they know i am not interested trying to break me until i decide that i need them in my life and that i should hand over thousands of dollars just to shut them up is actually psychopathic i am now too afraid to answer my phone i have decided that i will probably have to change my phone number now as much as i dont want to and shouldnt have to because i have no idea who to report them to i am sick of being constantly violated so i see no other option
4,14-07-2021,very good,satisfied with the services appreciate the support given by the trainers very helpful in developing my knowledge and understanding of the travel world  it has covered both theory and practical appropriately
1,08-07-2021,money focused,i signed up in early  during what i now know as a manic episode i was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder in mid  and my main priority and focus was on myself and making sure i was seeking professional help i was completely unaware of my mental illness and it wasnt until a psychosis episode that i realised it was something beyond my control discontinuing the course was the last thing on my mind i emailed and asked for special consideration and asked for a full or partial refund however i was told that because the cooling of read moref period had passed i am not able to get a refund so i provided documents to prove my diagnosis and psychiatrist and psychologist appointments to proof that this is in fact a circumstance that is well beyond my control i signed up unaware of my mental illness but they do not see it in that light unfortunately money has been an issue because of covid but i guess open colleges dont care about the wellbeing of anyone they honestly do not care about anything except for their bank accountif i could go back i would advise myself to not sign up however i cant so please do not sign up to any courses with open colleges they are only in it for the money and have no sympathy if open colleges was a person they would be karens please please please do not even consider signing up to any courses with them
1,08-07-2021,disgusting service,if there was a  star option for this company i would choose that option this people have no care or respect for there customers i have lost my job and in financial hard ship and missed my cooling off period my one day due to lose of work and they are not even giving me any sympathy at all they are making this so hard for me that i am in constant stress and mental brake downs disgusting service dealing with some girl name removed who has attitude and is horrible at caring for people don't even no why she is still in her job can say fo read morer all you people don't study here waste of your money and disgusting people to deal with i have gotten to the point that i am creating a case with consumer affairs to take this furtherso take it from me don't go through them
1,06-07-2021,a brothel has more integrity,it takes  to  weeks for a single assessment to be marked after emails requesting why you are left on your own with no actual support qld business do not like this establishment as they are unprofessional and ask for to much paperwork that is not industry focusedthey drag out marking assignments so you are forced to pay for extensions if you reside in qld you are made to look for your own work placement and when they fail to give you information do not let your job placement contact them other wise open colleges will ask for  for organising work placement the biggest white collar crime going when it comes education
1,02-07-2021,they do not rate  re scammers,absolutely hopeless  not sure the course was even accreditedwent to resolution institute as open colleges say they are a member what a lie did not even respondthey fail to answer any enquiries give out dodgy contracts courses are not even the correct ones enrolled in refuse to cancel a course refuse to give information about fees  just send you to a debt collector only interested in money however scam way they can get it do not give details to these people they do not provide what they advertise and cannot be trusted no stars they need to be exposed
1,17-06-2021,do not waste your time and money,awful awful terrible a complete joke no help whatsoever way too much work nothing but constant stress and inability to complete the massive amount of unhelpful and useless tasks halfway through the course they suddenly decide they can start charging  per incorrect question thanks for wasting our time and money these guys needs to be shut down
1,16-06-2021,terrible waste of money do not bother,i contacted open colleges a year ago to ask about the cert iv and diploma in hr i haven't studied in over  years and have only worked in general admin roles i wanted to broaden my career skills and have always had an interest in the hr world i discussed with my consultant what would be more beneficial for me in regards to obtaining work once i completed we discussed at length my previous education and work experience and i was advised that the diploma would be best suited to me and that my  years of doing administrative roles would b read moree enough for me to not only take on the diploma without any worries but pass quite easily i shared my concerns about this as i was unsure that i would be able to take on the diploma but i was comforted and reassured by the consultant that it wouldn't be too hard and that the course content was similar to the cert iv this phone call and subsequent calls after to organise payment and the signing of the contract left me feeling on top of the world and that i could achieve the outcome i had hoped forfast forward a year and it has done nothing but caused me anxiety stress financial loss is well above my knowledge and extremely difficult to complete the course content is quite frankly boring hard to follow and is very disconnected to what is required in the assessments first assessment is to put together a hr strategy for your fake company the information available to you regarding strategies is  page you are required to do your own external research in this subject creating such a complex document without any understanding of business strategies makes it hard to complete the answers to my questions from my assessor are cut and paste which i was afraid of as i noticed that pattern on the discussion page when i first started and honestly it put me off requesting help i have struggled to understand what i am meant to do there is only minimal information available through open colleges with the majority of my learning being through my own google searches and using what small information is available through ahri there are alot of links to external sites with recommended reading which end up being articles up to  pages long links to youtube videos for lectures from a german university lecturer that are over  hours long hard to understand and you cannot hear the questions the students ask only the answer
1,11-06-2021,wish i had read reviews prior to signing up,i have been completing the certificate iv in accounting the content is poorly structured and quite random the levels of support are absolutely despicable  it has taken a whole week for an assessor to answer some basic questions so i can complete my exercises concepts aren't throughly explained almost like there are explanations or more context missingin a nutshell its an unintelligent educational provider  i don't recommend
1,29-03-2023,i believe this place is a scam,i believe this place is a scam i canceled the course with them within the  day cooling period and was told that the course was canceled  weeks later they have taken  out of my account and still counting i have called  times only to sit on hold for over an hour and have someone tell me that the money would be refunded this has not been the case today was the th call with someone telling me the same story stay far far away from this place
1,03-04-2023,big scam dont ever enrol with open colleges you not gonna you will lose your time energy and money for nothing,since im still in the same situation nothing has changeddont ever enrol with open colleges you not gonna you will lose your time energy and money for nothingi have called open colleges over times by email and phone call there are canceling all appointments scheduled all at least all my online courses are closed without possibility to reopened without educator assessment  educator not professionalthis institution just wants your money now i understand why many bad reviews about them  it should be shared with a lot of people to avoid falling into the trap so i will make videos about themalmost months that i am with open college and too much delay too much injustice in the process motivation of the students have completed the modules  and  still waiting teachers to review my modules to let me  completed the work placement there is not following close with student they do everything to put the students very very low very unfair despite the calls etcconversation it gets worse and worsemajority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist and teachers dont care about it even you try to explain that the link are not working anymoreteachers putting not satisfactory every second paragraph even i  try my best  they booked me appointment for teacher training finally canceled it without raison and confirmation they are not care about studentscustomer service are speaking not really correctly and are not understandingwhat is sure i will talk about open college a lot so that avoids people  to fall in the trapim still waiting for how long you cannot do your job properly as a training center

2,28-02-2023,used to be ok now a,the only time it is easy to get through to open colleges is when you are signing up and paying money  good luck getting help  there is no communication between assessors and students  no feedback on assessments when you eventually get them back  the new osx has taken any ability to communicate and get help away  they don't listen and act on complaints  i contacted  minutes and a couple of other news shows hopefully they will report on all of the bad service
1,22-02-2023,theyre taking longer to mark then it took me to do the work,im still waiting for them to complete my marking they didnt start until i had everything completed which took me  months to complete and its been  months now since i submitted my last assignment and they still are not finished they had to give me  extensions so far of  months to accommodate how slow theyre marking process is which doesnt fully compensate the time wasted for what is supposed to be a  working days process im being left short on time to complete my need work placement and which i planned to have extra time to complete so i could do my placement where i wanted but due to the delays it looks like that will be unlikely to happen now
1,25-01-2023,the most racist college in australia,the most racist college in australia if asian students have completed  assignment they don't get chance to go for final placement but aussie do get chance even if they have completed less than   the tutors always target asian students

4,04-10-2022,pleasantly surprised,i was very satisfied with the assortment of topics covered in the community services diploma and it provided a good overview of the industry i would recommend they add additional information regarding law proceedings which many community members face but there was a plethora of information specific to counselling methods start early on applying for work placement left mine till the last minute and it was stressful very good assessment walk through recordings by the teaching team so it didn't feel as overwhelming
1,18-08-2022,awful services,i have been waiting for my certificate for a long time now despite following up and no action no one cares to replies emails i was being told to check my junk mail as an excuse to delay the process i could not talk to the person joshua who was following my case because rozelle didn't see the need for me to do that rozelle made sure i can't talk to anyone i don't trust the college
1,07-09-2022,they are horrible don't use their company,they are horrible meticulous and nitpicky they take forever to respond to and mark assignments and they charge you  to resubmit if you fail x which you will even using the marking key as a guide you will still receive it back they don't want you to succeed and make it incredibly difficult to do so
5,03-08-2022,diploma of community services  great experience,the resources and online help were educational relevant and up to date  the user platform and modules were easy to navigate and very helpful too  video assessment walkthroughs were great as was the weekly 'ask anything' session with trainer as well as response times when emailing trainer or help desk  recommend for anyone serious about this field
1,06-07-2022,stay away,i started this course as it was meant to be generic to fit any industry they said well that was rubbish the course content was poorly developed the content was not relevant and when trying to explain this to them they didn't even want to listeni am now going to be over k out of pocket and i have only done two modelsstay well away from oc i wish i had read some of these reviews before signing up
4,30-06-2022,very pleased to have completed this course,i did find it hard to be self motivated  in hindsight it would have been good to have a study buddy overall i found that when i reached out for help the staff were very supportive the content became much more interesting as i started my work placement and as hoped i got a job where i did my work placement very pleased and proud of myself for getting to the end
1,13-01-2023,false information,i was taking like a quiz thing to see what my future job could be since im curious they said it would only take mins and it took me forever and i didnt even get results
1,02-06-2022,if i could give them zero stars i,if i could give them zero stars i would if you become sick and have to stop the course you get charged a very large amount they have a tiered system so depending on when you have to cancel you get charged more and more their policies punish you for your health something no one can control be careful with this company they are money hungry and dont care that actual humans are trying to study
1,22-09-2022,what a scam don't waste your time and money,the assessments are very unfairly marked and then you will be asked to pay a fee to resubmit some of the course content is over a decade old and is no longer relevant at all the majority of the links on the course pages no longer even exist there are spelling mistakes in every second paragraph they did not even bother to run a spell check before publishing the course student support is close to nonexistent you will be waiting several weeks for a reply to an inquiry this organisation only cares about attempting to milk as much money as they possibly can from students
5,12-05-2022,open colleges  diploma community services,the assessors have been incredible flexibility extension approved was really important to me as i have been able to work fulltime and study part time successfully content and online learning material was great and i found the final observation  assessment in module  hrs to be insightful and enjoyable i will be furthering my studies  psychology but would highly recommend open colleges

1,19-01-2022,beware,the level of support although promised to be excellent was rubbish many students were complaining that work hadnt been marked and returned having to wait for returned assessments before the next unit was unlocked makes the course longer if you don't finish in time you pay extra trying to withdraw from the course without paying out the full fees is near to impossible no matter your reasons luckily i had a solicitor and my repayment was reduced people i've met say they're criminals beware

3,23-06-2021,unsatisfactory,overall the content was satisfactory although certain modules werent yet developed so i was waiting with no study for months to complete the course this ultimately gave me a lack of motivation  loss of study drive not all trainers are helpful only one actually replied to me regularly the others disregarded my messages these few things are unacceptable when undertaking a course and this has lead me to not recommend open colleges to others
1,30-11-2022,dont waste your money here,they are great when they wanna sign you up then after that they dont have time for you so many issues im doing aged care certification they dont tell you that you need  each assessment to pass and i have had assessors disagreeing with each others corrections causing me to waste a lot of time going back and forth thats actually if i get them looked at i have waited months for assessments to be even looked at not to mention there are so many errors spelling mistakes incorrect information for current policies  i work in aged care already so know some information is incorrect this whole certificate is a waste of money and time you barely learn anything about aged care at all you have to constantly chase to get things done and open space x is useless
1,24-06-2021,i will never study through this place again,i dont know what was worse the ambiguous training material or the student support who kept giving conflicting informationi suggest you retrain and periodically test the people who are providing information to your studentsi did not find the course worth the money you cannot cancel and get a refund or irritation that it caused me
4,07-09-2021,i enjoyed studying marketing,positives i enjoyed learning about marketing and enjoyed the no pressure approach to get assessments done it worked around my lifestyle and my job student support  great i have also recently got a job in digital marketingnegatives sometimes assessors took a long time to mark my work so i couldnt move on to next module and also some of the material in the course was really out of date ive learnt more from doing some digital marketing crash courses outside of open colleges
2,15-08-2021,would not recommended,would not recommendedthough the process of self paced online learning was ideal the lack of correspondence and delayed markings of assessments was poor and drawn out the assessments themselves were poorly written and assessors would frequently ask for resubmissions even though the feedback was positive and they identified the outlined criteria had been met after finishing the course months ago i am still waiting on certification despite me following up on multiple occasions
4,01-07-2021,the course was good and the assessors,the course was good and the assessors were great  i did struggle with some of the activities throughout the modules having incorrect information or answers which caused some stress when trying to work out what i was doing wrong which was nothingtime given to complete the course was appropriate and support was there if needed
5,22-04-2022,done and dusted diploma of community services,no road is as easy as the other today i can proudly say done and dusted the journey has not been smooth waters but getting the right kind of support and help was a great motivation to always look forward to the ending i would like to say my big thank you to rosan trainerassessor he has been very helpful all along i finally completed my diploma of community services i can't be thankful enough with the pandemic it has not been easy however perseverance was the key motivation for me to reach this far thank you open colleges and to all the support staff
4,23-07-2021,all in all a great experience,all in all a great experience however at the end waiting for a transcript i paid for i was informed i had to provide another first aid certificate as your course certificates can not be sent without a valid one given that first aid is a wholemodule i believe the module should be moved to further into the course to avoid such problems at the end i didn't receive an email or be told this had to happen until i called a week later asking where my transcript was very frustrating
5,04-08-2021,hi i found the course easy to navigate,hi i found the course easy to navigate and  all the instructions were clear and easy to followthe time frame set was achievable however due to circumstances i needed to extend which they were happy to assist withover all i really enjoyed my expierence with open colleges and would be happy to say to use this site
1,14-05-2022,thieves,thieves i wish i could give open colleges a big fat zero stars i did a certificate iv in vet nursing finished all my written modules with high distinctions and credits however struggled to find a practice that would allow me to do my training portion due to the fact open colleges do not have insurance and do not tell you this open colleges were no help in assisting me to find somewhere after paying over  they would not even provide me with a transcript or statement of attainment for the work id completed to use as a credit transfer expect no help from these people
4,16-07-2021,diploma of community services experience,overall good experience interesting course material assessors helpful though not very detailed feedback for assessments which would be useful for academic growth student services pretty average often needed to call  email follow up several times to get things sorted despite this i still recommend open colleges

4,19-10-2021,i thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of,i thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning online and found the open colleges team very supportive and helpful it did take me much longer to complete the diploma of community service than i thought it would but that was due to the pandemic which made finding work placement so much harderit takes perseverance and diligence to complete an online study and open colleges are there for you if you need support with academic or other issuesi would recommend open colleges as it is an affordable way to upskill
1,07-10-2021,cancellation fee is your course fee,i hope no one ever has to cancel or put your course on hold they've made it impossible to cancel or put on hold even if you are doing an online course or have any actual health problems they harass and force you to pay the whole course fee as a cancellation fee whether or not you're financially stable
5,27-07-2022,being someone with high anxiety the support from my assessor has made this course a breeze,i commenced my diploma in  and have since experienced hurdles i did not expect in my personal lifei started placement in february  and due to unforeseen personal circumstances had to delay it until june open colleges have been nothing but supportive while i have been unable to study and with the hurdles throughout placement they have been very accommodating to issues i was having within my placement organizationmy wpa assessment was much more relaxed and less nerve racking than i thought it would be my assessor provided me with a lot of information and extra knowledge for me to apply in further study and work

3,17-08-2021,i am very relieved i finished,i am very relieved i finished although i do feel the course was much harder than i thought questions that should have been made simple where written in a complicated formate requiring you answering in a more personalised context the work placement i felt was a bit over the top but in the end i got there
1,30-06-2021,do not study with them,do not study with themgo to tafe insteadterrible grammar in the material and  out of date information when i showed qualified professionals the course material they laughed it was so badthe qualification will not recognized in the real world and i just dont understand how they are still allowed to be open
1,26-09-2021,irrelevant and a waste of money,the assessment questions for the youth work cert iv are regularly very poorly worded often confusing and seem to have not been proof readi found the course generally to be utterly irrelevant to finding work in the field and the response times to questions was very poordo not waste your money
3,14-09-2021,i struggled,the assessments were good i learnt a lot from them and they were clear and easy to understand the placement was a problem though i found it so difficult to get placement and i had no help from open colleges i was told i would get help so i filled out some forms only to have someone do google searches which i had already done myself i found there was a very high turnover of staff which was frustrating i believe i only got through this course because of the help i got from rosan thanks rosan for all you did for me
5,12-08-2021,open colleges was excellent,open colleges was excellent the online delivery was easy to utilise course content provided was extensive and whenever i  required assistance the trainers or student support were always there to provide help i would definitely recommend open colleges should someone be considering online learning
5,10-09-2021,the assessor's feedback were very,the assessor's feedback were very helpful in the completion of my course though most of the time i hesitated asking questions because i think it's dumb like it's simple and i should know the answer but asking them and receiving the clarification from the assessors makes the projects easier
1,21-10-2021,totally ripped off,i enrolled in a course and didnt complete it i think i read one article and then changed my mind and never logged in again they still charged me in full   total rip off and waste of hard earned money they just see dollars couldnt care less if you actually get a qualification
1,12-08-2021,terrible experience,just graduated in a diploma of business after such a stressful time dealing with themcollege support team is somewhat helpful however the assessments are poorly written and most assessors are way too harsh and add things to the assessment that is not in the criteria also an upfront fee of  to resubmit an assessment that was poorly written in the first place is ridiculous especially during these tough timeswould not recommend taking up a course with them would definitely steer clear and go with another college
1,20-07-2021,i have paid for my course in full,i have paid for my course in full upfront i have been working on an assignment and have been struggling with one question i submitted it two times and received little guidance or feedback the answer to the question wasnt even anything that was covered in the information notes we were given i worked out what was required and finished the assignment when i went to submit it i was told i had to pay  to do so this is a ridiculous money making scheme no notifications where given this would happen and just very annoying
4,11-08-2021,my experience with open colleges have,my experience with open colleges have been great i would definitely recommend the only downfall is not having the assistance right then and there maybe if there was assessors available over chat for students to ask questions that would make the studying experience much more less stressful
4,13-07-2022,great educational experience,i originally signed up during the pandemic as i figured there was no better time to start then when forced to stay home and looking for where i wanted to move forward in life due to the nature of being online you definitely need to be self dedicated and it is easy to loose motivation but there are multiple avenues of support should it be required connecting with study buddies booking in faculty phone calls etc throughout my course i gained work experience which quickly lead to part time employment and then full time employment where i have now been employed for over a year in a job i love very glad i found open colleges and this course
1,19-03-2022,beware,beware there are some fantastic online study options and this is not one of them as many others have said medical evidence is not enough to stop them pursuing thousands of dollars there are petitions and suggestions of legal action against open colleges

4,11-08-2021,i found the course worthwhile,i found the course worthwhilemodules  to  assessments were thoroughthe workplace  hour activity invaluable the log form requires review reflecting the move to capture the experience in the portfolio not the many tables at the end of the activity logi think the portfolio is in some places a bit fulsome given the student has completed at this point the theory modules  to  and the practicality  of actual support work i'm unclear on why the portfolio has to be such a large document to complete i think it could be more fit for purpose
1,16-08-2021,open colleges seemed like a great,open colleges seemed like a great course when i first enrolled well it wasnt as time went on the little communication between the workplace assessor sometimes it took weeks just to hear back from them the grading took forever i waited over a month at times then to find out i have to finish to pay for the course before i get my certificate is just not on i was told my the workplace assessor that it would take a month for them to send it out it has been  months i wouldnt recommend open colleges to anyone and it was definitely not worth the

2,04-10-2021,unfortunately there were long time,unfortunately there were long time frames between submitting an assessment and to getting the results of a submitted assignmentreceiving feedback when asking for help from assessors also was not done in a timely mannerthere were too many grammar and spelling mistakes in the course material and many links to expand knowledge did not workmany of the questions were repetitive and i feel that there was huge expectation of students with the workplace portfolios that was unrealisticall of these concerns were regularly taken up with student support both verbally and in written format hopefully they have dealt with these issues
2,13-08-2021,when i first started the course the,when i first started the course the support from my assessor was great but by december  it had become very slow  i waited  weeks and more to have assessments looked at and then if i had to resubmit it would take weeks to have that checked  it was very frustrating and i eventually put in a formal complaint which didn't seem to make a lot of difference  it was  months from putting in my final assessments from my placement until i was finally graded and finished  i was lucky that the place i got employment at didn't ask to see the certificate or i would have missed out on the jobi don't have my certificate yet
5,29-06-2021,great learning experience,great learning experience excellent support from professional staff online learning is not for everyone though open colleges provided me with a way to achieve my goals thanking all of the team from open colleges with genuine appreciation

1,26-05-2022,they do not have the best support for,they do not have the best support for those with disabilityhealth condition or single parentsthe tutor did nothing to help me get my papers signed from placement he also ignored all my emails i was bullied but he did nothing even the patients were annoyed and disgusted on how i was treated and yet in a covid pandemic another student didnt get into trouble for doing  her work experience while sick with a cold in a hospital double standards and bullying occurs here other places are much more professionalalso all placement paper work is not done online so a nurse spilt water all over my notes and my tutor told me off when it wasnt my fault said i was unorgansied he had me in tears but just kept going on and on very cruel

4,03-09-2021,loved the course but needed more communication,there have been times when i would have appreciated more communication  things weren't always explained clearly regarding processes i have had to ask why i haven't finished the course when i thought i had this is because there isnt a list that tells you what you still need to submit when it comes to assessments i had missed a couple of things without realising i am now at  complete and have submitted all of my assignments  i had to ask why the  that remains is admin stuff from the colleges side when you're really excited that you've submitted the very last assignment and it sits at  with no explanation of why it takes a little bit of the joy of finishing away
1,16-09-2021,poor teaching skills,not happy with open colleges assessor tried to make me do an extra  hours on top of my already  hours of placement because i missed two questions on the placement portfolio she didnt understand my situation as i cannot do anymore placement hours before i need to earn a living she was very anal and quite always marked me wrong on basic things she wasnt anal in the good way she was very repetitive school wasnt very helpful at all with finding placement and you have to find your own it took me over a year to find placement for a course that was meant to take  months i shouldve listened to the reviews about this course before joining because i wouldve avoided it

3,16-07-2021,the structure of the course,the course structure is kind of repetitive en every module i didn't like the rigidity of the assessments when the student wants to do more or better of what is asked then answers from assessors is do not change the format of the assessments but the format of the documents limits the student to the minimum possiblei hate the way of assessing the practical part through  minute videos is imposible to really show everything you need and you have to become a master in video editing it would be much better if the student has the opportunity to do like a work practice in a real work place and being assess in working experiences but not sending videos to open colleges just being assessed by a professional hortuculturalist in real life
5,22-02-2022,i just completed my diploma in community services,i just completed my diploma in community service hurray my experience with open colleges was great but not easy i started my diploma in  and completed it in feb  the modules are great however because it's online and you don't get to do face to face with a lecturer you have to do a lot of reading basically you will find it hard if you sometimes want to implement day to day activities without reading modules one down side is that they need to do better in helping find work placement otherwise l am so much knowledgeable and up to now i rely on my modules l have learnt for my employment you have to prepare well for the final workplace assessment with the assessors  don't grow cold feet they will help you all the way  a big thank you to rosan and team

1,25-06-2021,look else where,if you think there is the slightest change you will not be able to finish the course do not go with open colleges my son suffers from anxiety so before he enrolled in a diploma we spoke to open colleges about the high chance of him withdrawing and costs we were explicitly told we would only pay for what he had done we asked for all financial correspondences to be sent to wife none of this happened my son pulled out less than half through not having done any units open collages pursued my son through their debt collectors for the full amount i filled in their complained form which they dutifully ignored for three months when they did finally look at it they did not directly answer any of the statements made in it extremely unprofessional
4,08-09-2021,the assessors are great communicators,the assessors are great communicatorsmy only negative review is the  day turn around for feedback was frustrating particularly while waiting for feedback on my final assessments
4,09-08-2021,i found it very easy to study at my own,i found it very easy to study at my own pace and my assessor was very thorough a pity there where not many markers as it was a bit long getting results overall i would do it again

4,18-10-2022,my open colleges experience,when i looked at studying i saw a diploma of community services and thought whats that i cannot believe that i went from not knowing what community services was to now graduating with a diploma in it i just want to encourage future students especially those who are contemplating doing this or are already doing it dont give up i experienced a lot of set backs during my studies pandemic health issues difficulty finding placement all whilst caring for my two young children with disabilities i felt like giving up at one stage but all it took was one person to say they believed in me well i believe in you i went from being a stayathome mum for years to now a graduate working in the industry as a team leader the biggest reward from all of this is seeing my childrens faces light up when telling others that my mum helps people for work i want to do mums job when i am older this has changed not only my life but my childrens thank you open colleges  especially rosan
1,26-07-2021,charge when handing up assignment for third time,was happy with the course until they started the  charge on your third attempt on an assignment the comments received by the assessors can be misleading at times and the assignments themselves are written poorly so it's easy to make mistakes technical issues go with the online experience as well so this just adds to the problem we are currently in a pandemic so money is a problem for everyone so i can't see how they could think it's acceptable to start charging people money for simply making mistakes we are here to learn not pay this rule has been put in place to save assessors time yet everytime i have to resubmit an assignment there is only ever one maybe two details i have missed so how much time did it take to write a comment for one or two details the argument for the case to charge people makes zero sense
5,20-07-2022,awesome course,i have leant a huge amount whilst undertaking my course the tutors were fantastic and the course content was so helpful for my career progression

2,01-12-2022,honestly be wary,open colleges is fine if you have studied out of school have the drive to self motivate and are prepared to wait a week for an answer for a basic clarity answer then go for it there is a lot of talk about support and student support before you sign up however they are unable to address any coursework concerns so don't rely on that finding placement is difficult and the ridiculously long workplace portfolios make a bachelor's degree placement look like a breezethe student forums are littered with people lost in the work and particularly the ambiguity of the wordingeverybody struggles to find placement not to mention complete the check in's etci completed my course and am working in the field there is plenty of good staff involved in oc however there are major flaws in the design and industry reputation there are even students stating they have to recomplete units when engaging in further study elsewherejust be wary  studying while working fulltime was great and studying at my pace was also great just weigh up the pros and cons i certainly wouldn't recommend to firsttime students
3,10-09-2021,i enjoyed open colleges while,i enjoyed open colleges while completing my diploma of counsellinghowever was very confused to find out that oc diploma doesn't give you the same as a diploma from other providers when i tried to become registered has a counsellor oc students have to do  supervisions throughout a year compared to  like other qualified counsellors it's like a diploma but you come out on your p's rather then your full licence given the cost and time given to complete this diploma i was frustrated that there was also no exploration from oc as to why this was eitherhowever the staff are very lovelythe outlay was easy to navigate and given that face to face learn as been disrupted during  and  i was very happy to be learning online from the beginningand the path way to continue further study at charles sturt uni is a fantastic pathway for those who wish to continue their studies
4,06-07-2021,miss,bit slow  in responding back otherwise team and teachers are really helping and have great knowledge  i recommned open colleges if u want to study online

5,23-07-2021,thank you open colleges,i don't know where to start from but i'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to each and everyone that has been part of my educational experience i'm honored to now say that i hold a diploma level of qualificationmy experience has been like a roller coaster when i started my module  i wanted to give up and withdraw because i knew i wouldn't be able to achieve this qualification requirement but the assessors of open colleges especially rosan lal gave me a confident and hope of being positive and take things at a time this i applied to my daily study routine and i found myself and today i am graduating everything is possible in this world so never give up keep trying thank you open colleges for everything you did and yes this covid really teared us apart but we kept going so big thank you to each and everyone of youbest wishesdeepak student oc  diploma of community services
4,09-08-2021,good student support,good student support theyre very friendly and happy to help with whatever you need open colleges was very understanding and supportive during covid
3,05-08-2021,great content not so great support,i have finally completed my counselling diploma i found the content of the course really well laid out and easy to digest however the direct contact and support from open colleges was poor the turn around time for marking at one stage was over  days making it very difficult to learn and improve with momentumthe assessorsteachers were really helpful but for most of my time inundated and difficult to reachmy advice to anyone who decides to take this course really think about how much support you need i found this course isolating i tried many times to reach out to find a study buddy in melbourne but it fell through each time that's not necessarily oc's fault but it's food for thoughtsecond part of advice is to really search for a placement opportunity from the get go don't wait don't dilly dally it was very hard for me to find an organisation to take me on as they usually are taking on uni students
5,13-07-2021,thank you for providing a fantastic,thank you for providing a fantastic opportunity for me to achieve my goal of graduating in certificate iii in early childhood education and care
1,08-07-2021,huge no from me,huge no from me i understand policy rules and am always more than happy to follow them however if a circumstance is beyond your control that impacts your ability to study the policy should be reconsidered open colleges is truly money focused and hungry and have absolutely no sympathy or understanding at all i was unaware of my mental illness when i enrolled and when i was diagnosed mid that year my priority was not to cancel or do anything about my course but rather focus on my health and seek further help from professionals open college does not understand this as my course has finished they will not refund me because as i am not able to continue my course as it has expired and because of the pandemic so many people have lost their jobs and are unable to continue to pay for their course but losing your job is not an excuse to them so no please do not sign up to any courses with them unless you want to throw money away
5,11-08-2021,awesome,this was a very informative yet enjoyable experience for me and i highly recommend using open colleges for your urge to expand your experience
1,30-08-2022,waste of time and money,waste of time and money so i cant recommend themi did my part and still running after my certificate for over month
2,28-06-2021,room for improvement,the assessments documents are formatted and worded terribly quite a few spelling and grammatical errors throughout very inconsistentit can sometimes be difficult to get in contact with some assessors as you cant book phone calls with them i also received misleading email communications  for example i was sent an email saying that i could extend my course but then when i applied for this i was told that my period to extend was expired i had received that email on the same day i was also sent an email saying that my course had expired and i didnt complete it when in fact i had graduated i had to call support to confirm this and resend my certificate of completionthe whole system is very cluncky there is a lot of room for improvementaside from that i had a really pleasant experience with one of my trainers  catherine tumelty she was so responsive and helpful and was the silver lining throughout the time i was doing study keep her
1,24-08-2021,wouldnt recommend at all,honestly its been a long and exhausting experience i wouldnt recommend open colleges at all ive struggled to get in contact with them in regards to finishing my course that ive been completing slowly over the years as i had a baby whilst i was studying i was told to send a special consideration form in march and havent heard back and its august im  finished but im so worried im not going to be able to finish it now ive called and it transfers me to another company ive emailed my assessor and the student support multiple times even complaining about the lack of communication still nothing ive even put in multiple requests on the website and havent heard anything its like theyve completely gone off the grid and now i feel like ive wasted so much time to do my course with them so close to finishing real shame disappointedfor some reason i cant respond to your reply open colleges but no ive had no response if you could help it would be great
5,16-08-2021,i had a good experience,i had a good experience i learned a lot and im glad i was chosen open colleges i am recommending my friends to join open colleges
5,06-09-2021,certificate iv in webbased technologies,i decided to move careers to the digital world and i wanted an entry point this course was the perfect jumping platform it is intense it's sometimes easy and other times complex each module enriches you and thoroughly involves you i don't think it's for the fainthearted but for those who are really willing to learn and get their hands dirty to get it done and come out shining at the other end i had no programming experience whatsoever and i got to make a website and even make an app from scratch i never thought it possible in my wildest dreamsopen colleges set up me for success i got the help i needed any time i asked for it  from the teachers to the admin staff their touch of humanity is there every step of the journey and it's greatly appreciated i fully recommend it and i'm grateful for the opportunity thank you everyone at open colleges without you i wouldn't have been able to realize my study dreams hold a fulltime job and take care of the family at the same time
5,19-10-2022,learning at my pace,very good learning platformlearning at your pacethank you so much rosan for your great support and patient

4,13-07-2021,thankyou,thank you open colleges for assisting me to get my diploma making things easy for people who work full time and would like to study
1,28-09-2021,not recommended,at the beginning of my course certificate iii in individual support everything ran smoothly once i got further into the course things began to go pear shaped despite open colleges claiming to provide superior student support at times i felt very neglected and completely without support liasing with assessors in an attempt to get constructive feedback was like fighting an uphill battle and grading at times took months putting a complete roadbloack on my being able to progress further with my studies the student portal would often malfunction which really took away from the convenience of online study this course caused me severe stress as progressing further in my career and studies was put on hold due to their being understaffed and inability to mark assessments in a timely manner some of the assesors were a great help but all around this experience was not one i would wish upon anyone and i will not be studying through open colleges ever again or be recommending them to anyone else based on this experience
4,04-10-2021,good course but would be good to have a,good course but would be good to have a way of tracking what assignments are completedsometimes takes too long to get feedback
4,28-06-2021,good course,good courselate change to assessors  due to restructure at the collegebig help with helping me finish the course on time
4,05-08-2021,would like to see more maths content,would like to see more maths content added to course apart from this a great course felt very prepared with work placement
4,03-08-2021,online learning with open colleges has,online learning with open colleges has been a wonderful experience the impact of covid made the choice easy but there were frustrations along the way studying alone is sometimes ideal but there is nothing better than bouncing off ideas with fellow students unfortunately finding a study buddy or buddies is frought with difficulties  studying at the same level and intensity studying at the same time connecting with people you intrinsically like or dislike these reasons can erode your enthusiasm and connectiveness to the study it is an enormous challenge on top of the modules themselves  in part students begin the course in a staggered format which leads to a level of non conformity perhaps the college could connect students at the beginning like an online class so as students can connect and find friends to connect with otherwise finding a study buddy is too haphazardthe content of the course was definitely comprehensiveconnecting with student support was simple and all were wonderfully helpful as were the sssessors
1,14-02-2022,there is no support from trainers and,there is no support from trainers and the work load is stupiddon't go here unless you want to be put off your dream
1,26-03-2022,waste of time and money,i studied through open colleges to get my certificate  in youth work i completed all the theory modules and only had my work placement to complete when the first wave of covid hit back in  i applied to so many places that couldn't let me do my work placement because of the  person per m squared rule in offices i extended my studies twice and after the rd time of trying to extend they wouldn't let me unless i had to pay the full fee of over  again to renew the course when i told them i couldn't afford it and that i wanted to have my modules that i had completed on my usi statement of attainment they told me that it would be on there i went on the usi website to check my statement of attainments recently only to find that instead of saying i have completed those theory modules they have put i withdrewdiscontinued all of them which was not the case for those theory modules i put my time and effort into from what i gather i cant even use those modules that i have actually completed to go towards rpl if i went into another certificate meaning i have to do them all over again
3,06-05-2022,it's not terrible but also not great,this is not a terrible experiencethe assignments are fine i do appreciate the assessment walk through by rosan  those are exceptionally helpfulthe final assessment with your work place assessor is surprisingly chill and there is really not something to stress aboutthe feedback given by assessors has always been helpful and very easy to have questions answered in time i found the online staff regarding gaining access to modules and extending the course extremely professional and efficient i can not fault rosan sarah and staffmy sub par rating for the course live in the material and assessmentslinks in the modules rarely work i found some of the information about particular subjects lacking pointless and repetitive assignments and believe that the entire training package needs an overhaul module  is completely redundantif you are needing this diploma and you are already working in the industry this is a breeze and may not actually broaden your knowledge or peak your interest but you'll get a qualificationif this is your first step into community services it may be best to do some further research into open colleges before signing up
5,25-06-2021,support was great,i found the assessors answered you in a reasonable time and the course content and online accessibility was great
3,14-09-2021,the course had a lot if useful,the course had a lot if useful information which i can use in my industry it will help meove ahead in my career
4,06-08-2021,the marking between assessments,the marking between assessments sometimes took approx  days which delayed you moving onto the next module

4,05-07-2021,open colleges provided overall a great,open colleges provided overall a great alternative to studying a course with flexible hours when approached several times the student support and trainers team were extremely helpful and genuine about wanting students completing there coursethe feedback i would give is to have scheduled regular check up calls to keep students on track remindercheck in emails are easy to either skip or miss all together the main flaw with this style of education is the lack of 'facetoface' contact which you would get in a classroom setting either this or have a timetable of due dates for portions of the course to minimise students not leaving enough time for each assessment or completion of the coursethe cert iv vet nursing was a very big unit to complete and certainly took up more time than ever anticipated i certainly fell into the trap of not knowing how much time to allocate per task which resulted in extensions and cramming in a lot of the work at the 'last minute'having goals for where you should ideally be in your completed content during the set duration of the course would help immenselythe content and resources the course provided was great and informative as well as very accessible help by trainers if approachedi appreciate every effort open colleges put into the eventual completion of my course special thank you to amanda and victoria

4,27-08-2021,user friendly setup and well structured,user friendly setup and well structured layout i enjoyed my time with oc
2,23-08-2021,disappointed,throughout this course i received very minimal support or help from the trainers for example when i sent emails with my enquiries i received responses which was just copy and paste from the faq pages that i had already read but still needed further clarificationi did not feel that the trainers genuinely wanted to help if i requested more clarification than what was on the faq pages an example for this is in one of the modules i had a total of  or more backward and forward emails to a trainer trying to ask for help as to where i went wrong i was in the end instructed to just submit my work as it was because it was too hard to see where i went wrong without seeing the data when i got the grade the feedback stated that i needed to ask more questions if i was stuck on something this was very frustrating to hear as i tried very hard to get further clarification but was told to submit my work by the trainer anywaythe overall wording of the activities learning material and case studies was appalling and you can tell that no one has gone through and actually read the modules and the activities recently to ensure it is kept fresh and up to date half the time it felt like double dutch and like it was written by someone whose second language is english i am shocked that this is how a cert iv is presented especially when i paid over k for this coursethere is no way that i would recommend anyone to use open colleges for study as this was a struggle
5,24-02-2022,rosan really made the assessment stress,rosan really made the assessment stress free and set my mind at ease

1,12-10-2021,fake promises,diploma of counsellingi just want to clarify this rating isnt for the staff or the course both deserve  stars the trainers and course were amazing however this review is for the promises that i was givenbefore starting this course i was advised from open colleges that my diploma of counselling would allow me to work anywhere i want without further study probably my fault for believing them or not doing further investigations but anywayon this premise i signed up and completed my  year course in  registered with aca and did volunteer work during my coursesince then i have been rejected from every job i have applied for i have been applying for jobs religiously since graduating one year now and cannot land a job or an interview purely because my qualifications arent enough remember i was told they are and little to no experiencealso competing against psychologists who can get medicare rebates will kill you i could not gain one client because they all want a rebatei wasted a ton of money getting an abn public liability insurances and indemnity and anything else to try and work for myself not to mention renting a room in a private practice bleeding money every week without any clients because again they want a rebateanyways i have given up on this career and have moved on its a shame i really wanted to be a counsellorso yes this one star rating is for the lies i was lead to believe total rubbish this diploma wont get you anywherejust know if you do this course it more than likely wont be enoughtotal waste of time energy and moneythats life i guess

2,05-10-2021,the longest journey,i started around christmas of  i was coached that it was easy to sign up and start today when i started there was a tour thru the website once starting the certificate it was almost to easy to do information given to you and you just need to make the answer shorter as you go thru the certificate the teachers get more particular and start to be very detailed about why you didn't add something when stated not to or you can't go  over the word could but then you don't have enough asking for help just wasn't really an option unless you plan to wait for an answer that isn't helpful you have to look for what you think is neededlisten to the webinars but take some of it like a grain of salt as some teachers make there own rulesstudent support was frustrating due to continusly having to simplify what i was looking after and then getting told to just contact your teacher as they got stuckgetting a buddy to study with didn't really work for mesupport is needed with this course and people that understand exactly what you are talking about and not just guessingcommunication is very broken as you then wait days at a time just for a reply year was not enough to complete the course as i finally did my observations to finish september  i know covid had an impact but alot of this is online how is it even affectedopen module up early as there may not be someone in the office when you need it openthe only outlasting people that i felt did there job well was trish who also taught cert  in disability and nicole the rn from nt these two workers showed compassion and wanted listen and help you that was the qualities everyone needed and i thank them for that
5,29-09-2021,found to content easy to follow and,found to content easy to follow and staff helpful
1,29-06-2021,cert ii in horticulture,i found it very difficult to progress through my course at my own pace video assessment pieces were challenging especially at firsti was assured that i did not need a workplace placement to complete the course but in fact it would have made it so much more relevant and easier in the long runmodules were not unlocked at the start of the course and i was prevented from moving through while i waited on assessments to be completed due to difficulties with videos when i could have continued to progressdue to taking advantage of a discount i was talked into enrolling when i knew i would have no time to work on the materials and in the end had to pay for extensions partly because of the time wasted waiting for modules to be unlocked and partly due to continued work and family commitmentsi also had some difficulty understanding one of the trainers when i reached out for clarification it would have been easier to have one person to contact throughout the course rather than have different people pick up questions on the discussion pages for each module's assessmentsassessment items had limitations such as onepage poster twopage leaflet or three minute video when it was impossible to present all the information required within these restrictions almost every presentation assessment required explanation of whs considerations when we had previously completed a module about whs and this took up time when an understanding of new material could have been demonstratedthank you for taking the time to respond to my review although it seems as though my opinions have been dismissed i never expected not to work to gain my qualification nor do i fail to understand assessment guidelines and why they are in place my further study will not be completed through open colleges
3,21-09-2021,qualified student review,while i am so happy to have completed my course  i have had some time to reflect on my experience while overall the experience was good there are some points i believe would be helpful for open colleges to look intothe student platform 'open space' is not as user friendly as made out it is not compatible with all devices used and the 'percentage' area is not in real time or sometimes does not update at all  the chat feature however is fantasticthe modules are not set out in a way that makes much sense  many of the modules require you to stop halfway through as you cannot complete it without work experience leaving you at the end with all these half finished modules which doesn't really make sense as you need to complete modules to unlock the nextsome of the questions in the modules are very cryptic  while there are module helpers sometimes the module helpers seemed more of a motivational speech rather than an example or help so when you complete a task and submit the teachers are looking for something specific that was not specified in the question and almost felt like i had to read between the lines a lot while the teachers were fantastic at helping when you asked for it  if the questions and tasks were set out clear and concise this would free up a lot of their timei do also think a 'student manual' of some sort would be useful that sets out what task to do when and how to submit assignments sort of like an online checklist at the start that would also make it easier to see what is left to dothe tutors were very helpful when i needed it with very quick turn around i do think the course needs a bit of tweaking just to help people get their qualifications as many times i felt unmotivated when submitting assignments knowing that i would have to resubmit again and againlooking forward to receiving my certificate and i hope open colleges staff are all getting through this lockdownsophie
4,22-06-2021,i have learned a lot in this course,i have learned a lot in this coursei believe some of the written assessments could've been less repetitive marking times were very long and i had alot of difficulty having my placement signed off due to an oc staff leaving
5,18-06-2021,i got what i wanted through open,i got what i wanted through open colleges and that was knowledge and a job that i lovei could not have gotten there without themthank you
1,18-06-2021,don't study with open colleges,i would never recommend studying with open colleges they are unorganised under staffed and the only way to get any issues resolved is to make formal complaints the course material in health and leisure cert iv does not cover enough practical teaching specific to aged care lifestyle job role
2,17-06-2021,unhelpful trainers and support network,my partner faced an immense toll on her mental health having to pay extra money to take out an extension just to get assignments marked and emails read with little help from all involvedshe has had a major set back on her career having spent thousands of dollars for her to be told she cant receive her certificate due to open colleges not marking her assessment in time a terrible organisation who will not answer any phone calls or emails regarding the situation i am still waiting for an answer
5,16-06-2021,i have just graduated from the diploma,i have just graduated from the diploma of community services it took me yrs part time to complete i love that it was self pace it was challenging but i managed to complete it with minimal support i always found student services to be helpful and respond to queries in a reasonable time frame if i decide to study further i would absolutely consider open colleges again
3,15-06-2021,i was very appreciative that i was able,i was very appreciative that i was able to obtain my certificate  on line and have the opportunity undertake my studies in my own time  i found the modules interesting and relevant to what i was studying  my modules and assessments were marked in relative good time however i did struggle with getting feedback in a timely manner  student support were always very polite and helpfulhowever when it came time to complete my work placement the process caused me a lot of anxiety  there was  no support from open college in finding a placement and when i finally was successful there seemed to be a standoff between the facility and open college  there was no communication between the two and i spent hours on the phone trying to facilitate this process  it took  months from when i was approved to when all documentation and paperwork was signed off to complete a mere  hours of actual placement  the time i spent with the clients and other support workers was rewarding and i learned a great deal from these amazing people  i would suggest future students are made aware of the challenges they are to face regarding the main part of the course ie their placement prior to commencing and paying their fees  it would be helpful if open college liased with specific facilities in all states in order to provide students with some direction regarding their placement  if this were the case facilities students  and open college would have  a mutual understanding of requirements  it would be a smooth transition for students saving time and stress for all concerned  in my opinion student placement is the most important part of the course but due to the complexities of documentation staff at the facilities have no time to deal with the additional workload and copious amounts of paperworkhaving the weekly communication on line was a great idea and unfortunately was only available at the end of my course but hopefully future students will benefit from this helpful guidanceoverall i am pleased i did the course but what i initially believed was a  month course has drawn out to be  months and although i have completed my course i am still yet to receive my certificate
5,15-06-2021,excellent education,open colleges provide simple wellorganised courses that really help students acquire qualifications and learn essential skills in the field of their choice i was most impressed by the support i was able to access from trainers considering my course was completed  online time well spent great job occourse diploma of social media marketing

4,15-06-2021,studying with open college's was a great experience,studying with open college's was a great experience the fact that its online means i could get it done in my timeit was only when covid hit when it started to be a pain it was difficult to find work placement when it first started then modules were changed and added which caused me some stressthe assessors throughout the whole course were fantastic and did their very best to help even through covid and i wouldn't have been able to finish without it
1,10-06-2021,definitely go with another education institution  not open colleges,sorry open colleges does not even deserve a one  star ratingthey take on average  weeks to mark an assessment then if you have to make a small change to a question its another  weeks before you hear from them then staff are so rude and say that i am taking too long to do course  omg  i have a friend who did the same course with another institution and they got their assessments back in about  daysopen colleges assessors don't turn up to assess you and they never respond to emails  i was forced to pay extra money to do an online manual handling course because assessor didn't turn up to assess my manually handlingi was so frustrated with open colleges paid a heap of money for nothing finished everything and never received a resulti am in the process of taking legal action against themdo yourself a favour  dont enrol with open colleges
5,09-06-2021,reliable sources for the course,reliable sources for the course trainers and students support staff members theyre helpful and professional
3,09-06-2021,don't expect it to be easy,don't expect it to be easyi chose to study my cert  in childhood education via open colleges because i naively thought there would be less work well there was a tonne of work the workplace portfolios alone are just a crazy amount of work getting through this coursework was so overwhelming the work itself isn't hard there is just so much of it that i couldn't see myself ever completing the cert thankfully the team were willing to give me multiple extensions for my course i started at the end of  and only just recently completed the course in june of  i only recommend studying with open colleges if you are a selfmotivated individual
4,07-06-2021,cert lll in education support,the course was great and the content was floorless i give  out of  as as with anything it can always be improved quite often i felt i was falling between the cracks i'm sure with computers these days its not hard to write a program that monitors student activity and if there is nothing for a few weeks maybe flag that student for an assessor to touch bass with the problems i have in my life are out of the ordinary and often i felt lost and that nobody know or cared however everyone i talked to was always very helpful and understanding just feel this could help keep some students like myself motivated and on track
5,07-06-2021,open colleges have been amazing with me,open colleges have been amazing with me and my studies in travel my assessor was so accomodating and helped me immensely having the ability to study from home has been great for me i have two young babies and a household to upkeep and throughout this pandemic my assessor tanya has been wonderful i would highly recommend open colleges for your next studies thanks again
2,06-06-2021,may as well be a degree not a celtic,the trainers put so much pressure on students to answer questions which have no relevance to the qualification peter mcclatchey asked for adjustments to assesments on the final day of studies and his comments did not match the study materials or the questions in the assessment the pressure this put on my partner who is a full time working single mum is ridiculous i have worked in the field of training and education coplaince for many years and have never seen anything as ridiculous as this
3,04-06-2021,a mixed experience,academic support was very good however learning materials were outdated poorly edited and qad the open spaces team and support were very good
4,03-06-2021,finally graduated thanks to the support of opencolleges,it was convenient for me to be able to study online when i did need assistance the trainersassessors were able to help meassessment responses were constructivestaff are friendlyi found the course work to be up to date and relevanti found that some of the links didnt work which made it hard to see graphschartsspecial mention to rosan for supporting me during placement assessment he inspired me to become motivated again to complete my course he is very professional and definitely is very experienced in the community services sectorthank you to the trainersassessors for all your help and guidance i would study with open colleges again
4,01-06-2021,enjoyable course to complete,helpful and a smooth course to complete  trainers are helpful and able and ready to always help the assessments are also clear and trainers available to explain on what is difficult to one completing the course
5,01-06-2021,excellent,i found it extremely easy and convenient studying online with open colleges the support was great assessment turnover fast and i particularly liked the live chat support service through open space it made full time work and study possible
5,30-05-2021,great course,the course i have chosen certificate iii in business administration was well presented challenging and well structured audio and video presentations were fun and taught me to present in front of the public which is always a challenging aspect throughout my course i have received a great support from the entire team staring from the support team who were promptly unlocking my new modules to all trainers and assessors that i had to interact with thank you for your help and support
4,29-05-2021,not  but still happy,course work was well described before initiating course however the when trying to get answers or help from from assessors it took too long to receive a response or they purely said to read over the textbook againi still however would do another course via open colleges
5,27-05-2021,first time studying after many many years,after being out of the work force for over six years i thought it was time to get back in to it now that my children are in school it gave me the opportunity to gain some new skills and start a career in something i am passionate about after doing some research i came across the education support course through open collegesi haven't studied in a very long time and i was a little worried about how i would go the website is so easy to use that all my stress about getting back into studying just went away feedback on assessments was fast and detailed i cannot recommend open colleges enoughthe level of assistance and guidance was fantastic the website is easy to use and the assessors and trainers were always happy to help i would recommend open colleges to anyone that is looking to do an online course
4,27-05-2021,i enjoy the platform open college,i enjoy the platform open college offersi have tried the same course at another college and could not finish the program because the platform is difficult to navigatei enjoy the total experience and would recommend open college
5,27-05-2021,i found open colleges professional,i found open colleges professional  patient and supportive  my requests were replied promptly thankyou for making me journey easy
5,27-05-2021,hands down the best,hands down the best everyone has been patient and so helpful throughout my course definitely will be studying more in the future with open colleges
5,26-05-2021,thank you,overall i enjoyed my course  not having had anything to do with dental other than being a patient before i started  the course structure was user friendly and the staff were great and very helpful   some of the content such as developing xrays in solutions was outdated compared to where i found work however after realising some workplaces are still using this method i understood   something needs to be done to prevent students from contacting other students asking for thier answers or videos especially when i ticked off that i didnt want to be a study buddy   i found that incredibly rude when i was asked to send my video and my hard work by that student  some sort of blocking mechanism needs to be put in place when no study buddy is requested  overall though it was a good experience with open colleges
1,26-05-2021,choose to study anywhere else,they were inconsistent with everything and when i asked for help they just said to figure it out on my own i paid using direct debit and when it stopped i thought i had paid it off but months later i got a debt recovery letter for an outstanding amount no one had contacted me about it's been nothing but stressful beyond measure and i would not choose to study with them again i wish i never did in the first place
5,26-05-2021,i loved my experience at open colleges,i loved my experience at open colleges  i found the support was great especially from claire
4,25-05-2021,student support was great as was the,student support was great as was the timely marking of and returning of assessments
1,25-05-2021,from links that never opened during the,from links that never opened during the course work to  checklists that didnt match for the workbook to sending me some of these after i finished the course to now two months later still trying to submit the papers they need  noone seems to know what is going on everytime the supervisor tells me what i need to submit i do that and there is some other random piece of work they need   i did a masters degree with less fuss than trying to get a cert iv from this institution  would never study with them again
4,25-05-2021,i was really satisfied,i was really satisfiedthe staff were friendly and helpfulsome of the assignments took a while to get marked but that would be my only gripe
5,24-05-2021,love open colleges and highly recommend,love open colleges and highly recommend them
5,22-05-2021,excellent and supportive study environment,i had really good experience with open colleges oc some of my experiences i wanted to share the trainers were very responsive to my queries i was only available to study on the weekends but any queries i sent to oc i always get a response by monday when they get back to work on the weekday the assessment tips and especially the webinars were extremely helpful for completing the assessments you do need to have microsoft office on your computer to make your life easier with the study i also like the fact that the course includes  memberships ipa  abn as well as the subscriptions to reckon  that helps with starting me off the ground for bookkeeping works would like the course to include xero subscription and training but you can always sign up for free  month with xero and xero does have free xero hq training if that's what you're after the turnaround time with the assessors to all of my submissions were within  weeks as promised most of the times much quicker i guess it depends on how many assessments they got submitted at the same time  the assessors were also very encouraging and provide easy to understand feedback should the assessment need to be resubmitted one of the things i wanted to mention is the trainersassessors are not there to provide us with answers to the assessment they are there to guide us  and sometimes i find their guidance helpful sometimes i find them a bit vague when i find the response a bit vague then i asked more specific questions and usually then i get the response i needed to complete the assessment so just keep your thinking hat on and remember the course is to give us the knowledge and also help us to develop the skills like research to be working as bookkeeper in the real world most of the times on your own the discussion board is also another place i find very helpful  that's the first place i go to when i start each module's assessment to read through what all other people queries are so i don't have to ask the same question to the assessor i started my course in july and finished in may but i had about  months break during covidxmas remember i can only study on the weekends so really this course can be done within a few months if you want to finish quickly but you can also take your time and finish it within  years so i think oc is pretty fair to have the course open for  years for most people to complete the coursei had in mind to start my own bookkeeping business after this course and i certainly feel that it has given me a lot of ground works to put me in the right direction there are of course a lot more to learn and complete in order to start my own business so in conclusion definitely recommend open colleges
5,21-05-2021,open colleges was a wonderful way to,open colleges was a wonderful way to get my diploma and dream job i recommend open colleges to everyone
4,19-05-2021,certiv in youth work,this was my first time studying in  years  initially i found it hard to navigate around the site and even finding things later in the course was hard at times  the content was easy to follow though once i got my head around it  the chat with support option was really handy and i utilised that quite a bit  compared to other youth worker courses out there it was quite involved but doable
1,19-05-2021,the online student support were very,the online student support were very kind however when something was needed you had to ask  different people before anything happens also had lots of problems uploading portfolios they were constantly sent back to me to fix the smallest of inconvenience and it seemed like a waste of time waited over  days for my course to be evaluated only in the end for me to once again check in was only told that i had graduated when i was suspicious about how long i had been waiting while waiting for my assessments back by this time working on the assessor schedule i was told i had poor time management despite time being out of my hands i wont be coming back to oc
5,19-05-2021,i quite enjoyed my experience with open,i quite enjoyed my experience with open colleges i did use longer than the year to complete however student support were very understanding and were happy to extend my course i liked being able to study in my own time and receive quality feedback
4,19-05-2021,overall good college,open colleges was helpful on assisting me when needing and great at providing accurate and clear feedback for assessments there was sometimes a lack of communication with booked phone calls with trainers and assesors but overall would recommend to a friend wanting to study online
3,19-05-2021,reasonable course,reasonable coursepain in the ass placement requirements being a room leader of a childcare centre isn't enough to be a workplace supervisor they need to have held the diploma for  years which only  person at my centre had i didnt even work with her but she had to sign off all my documentstaking  months to get the diploma certificatethere are better places available
4,19-05-2021,overall good experience,overall good experience great support from rosanareas for improvements additional study resources assessors response to academic questions ways to engage online students in collaborationscurrently the course would only suit people with previous experience of online study and a great deal of selfmotivation and resilience  looking for student placement when not working in the industrykeep up the good workalla evans

3,04-05-2021,i unfortunately had a lot of trouble,i unfortunately had a lot of trouble with oc although the assessors are really lovely  while i was doing my course work and assessments they could sometimes take up to  weeks to respond back to me whenever i had a questionit was only towards the end of my course that they started to respond quicker because of how much trouble i was having with my placement due to no contact with my workplace supervisor  so no check in phone calls and no answering questions about requirements my workplace supervisor basically got fed up with oc and refused to sign my  hours of placement i then had to do a further  hours of placement at another facility  which was impossible due to covid  i had to pause the course for  months because of this i was also told that i would get a special extension due to all of this only to find that my course expired with no warning after having to call the student help line i was told i have to request an extension and write my entire situation on a form  even though they had record of it already and told me i didn't need to do anythingi do however appreciate oc apologizing to me for all this happening alex nicol has been amazing through this process and has made me feel a lot better about it all i finally have my diploma but it sure took a lot to get it haha
2,04-05-2021,what a nightmare of school,from my perspective as an experienced nail artist and certificate iii nail technology student trying to finish the course intellectual content is ok dense material to learn in detail about the whole basics complex modules and strict with legislations health and safety and legal rules however out of date old style techniques and processes of teaching the course doesn't follow the advances of the market and the real life of the nail industry it's cheaper than a proper school like tafe french beauty academy etc but the stress of actually learning out of theory is exhausting finding your own clients to do things people don't really like find loads of people that are keen to receive treatment just for the extensive assessments hell the work placements don't match the reality of salons with real clients you cannot do assessment tasks on clients that are paying for treatments the way they want it doesn't make any sense tiring find a workmate with timepatience to be your supervisor while they are busy doing their own job ask the workmate to analyze and fill up heaps of paperwork that should be the responsibility of the school come on where on earth a governmentsubsided school can be so corrupt and nonsense open colleges is the nightmare of modern nail spas nail bars and fastpaced busy nail techs internet and small brands are on the market not only because they make money but because they teach and they sell reality for people that have a genuine interest and talent to be a nail tech already if you're a newbe looking for a certificatepiece of paper go for it tafe preferably but open colleges trash don't waste your money and time to ruin your patience nights of sleep and professional reputation among beauty colleagues
2,04-05-2021,assessment assistance is poor,where is the genuine assistancewe shouldn't have to submit an assessment to receive assistance as that counts as submitting which is terrible seeing as you get  go's before having to repay for an assessmentthe course i chose is good though the trainers are not really trainers because they are not training the customers if someone asks for assistance why send the same generic template to everyone why not give assistance as if it was face to face i lost motivation doing this course because of the lack of assistance when it was needed and continuously resubmitted assessments because of this
3,04-05-2021,program contents and delivery method,overall this online building and construction diploma program is good for people who already have tremendous practical experience such knowledge is required to understand the program contents well and tackle the assessments you are totally by yourself there is little support available throughout the study periodthe course contents should be regularly updated including hyperlinks with course modules for each module there should be live lectures to facilitate a better understanding of the course topics and that students can ask questions the recorded lectures should then be placed online regular tutorials should be held so students can seek help on specific topics and learn from the discussion of other studentsin many cases the assessment questions are wordy vague the assessment should be revised
5,03-05-2021,open colleges has been amazing,open colleges has been amazing yes its an adjustment learning online but there is support if you just aski find the team on the phone could have a little more training on general information that you advertise on your website  with that said they are so friendly and will get back to youplacement support from hayden was incredible im very thankful for his dedication and follow throughthe trainers especially alex and kelly are brilliant great constructive feedback and willing to go the extra mile for students
5,01-05-2021,thank you very much to all the teachers,thank you very much to all the teachers and assessors who diligently assisted me throughout my course
5,29-04-2021,thank you for being so helpful duringmy time of study,thank you for being so helpful during my time of study i would recommend studying with open colleges again in the future thanks once again
4,28-04-2021,loved my overall experience  would recomend,my overall experience was good i loved how this course allowed you to go at your own pace the information was easily accessible to you at any time and it was relevant to the work my problems are with the site itself how it was a bit glitchy at times the staff were friendly and helpful most of the time
3,28-04-2021,i believe that the assessments where,i believe that the assessments where complicated to understand with a lot of information to read before understanding what was askinga lot of the questions where very broad and not specificassessments are just given without any guidance and just expected to understandinconsistency with assessments  some has quizzes others didnt some units just had written assessments while others had video evidence includedprovided course material was very helpful and detailedwhen i reached out to the assessor i got great responses and feedback to to questions
5,28-04-2021,great choice,great choiceso glad i decided to do this course it was a great stepping stone into the world of travelthe tutor tanya gayle was engaging supportive and knowledgeable on all topics the content right up the end was constructiveoverall a very pleasurable experiencethank you oc
5,28-04-2021,excellent platform,excellent platform the best part where the student support and the instructors friendly and helpful they guided me and gave me all the options to be able to finish the course successfullyone advice follow the study schedule because it requires time and you don't want to run out of time and need an extension but if you need the team is helpful and will guide you through it
4,28-04-2021,great course and instructor was always,great course and instructor was always quick to respond to queries good to refresh knowledge
1,27-04-2021,only study with open colleges if you want to become depressed,the pro's  assessorstutors seem nice  nice layout to the websitethe cons so much information is incorrect or out of date with much of the information at least  years old many of the external links including extracurricular material they tell you to read no longer work some extra curricular material they ask you to read does not seem appropriate to this level of course but more suitable to a degree that is a personal view many grammatical and spelling errors throughout the course including assignments which are also worded poorly and can be hard to understand some assignment questions do not seem appropriate to the case study in question which makes answering them very confusing  the way the learning material is laid out does not flow and is confusing to follow along with there is no proper forum in which to touch base with other students which i was told there was when i signed up  their admin team is poor  multiple mistakes throughout my time with them including telling me my course was ending a year before it should have due to them listing me as doing a different course  i fell very ill during my course and they made me go back to my doctor repeatedly because they were not happy with the doctors certificate  in the end my doctor had to call them to sort it out and  i was also repeatedly told i could not extend my course when i in fact could which caused me intense mental anguish as trying to fix their errors is incredibly difficult due to covid limitations i've been having difficulty securing a work placement for the past year i'm in melbourne and getting open colleges to help is really hard they just throw barriers at you they need you to provide proof of the places you have approached for work placement before they will help you but its hard to provide proof when everything has been done over the phone  basically if you can't get a work placement for yourself you fail  a couple of potential work placements i contacted seemed to reject me after i told them i was studying with open colleges and i don't understand why  i've almost ran out of extensions and have been told i can't apply for anymore when i signed up i was told it was virtually impossible to fail this course and that they would do everything they could to help you that is not true this course has caused me to become incredibly depressed which is insane as i did this course to help people with mental health issues mental health cert  i tried to give them  stars but i just can't  the pretty website and nice assessors just arn't enough sorry
2,21-04-2021,be wary of chris hosking as your trainer,the only good experience about open colleges is the amazing people on the student support end who helped me through the absolute difficulty it was trying to complete my cert iii in captive animals under my trainer chris hoskingchris would take far too long to respond to messages and questions and would repeatedly move appointments i had set for interviewerstudent questions i had to request multiple course extensions due to my appointments being shifted against my willi'm sure theres some good excuse he has for this behaviour and i apologise if this is not his fault but this definitely should not be affecting his students academicsi may try working through open colleges again but not under chris hosking
5,21-04-2021,i have gained so much from the course,i have gained so much from the course community service and have found the assessors amazing to connect with they all have been supportive and understanding overall i would definitely recommend this course
5,19-04-2021,i have learned so much with this,i have learned so much with this course the comments and feedback are so very important i can now look forward to my next learning experiencei am excited to learn that i have completed everything and have succeeded in completing all tasks i am waiting on final confirmation of my graduation that will be something to celebratethankyou to everyone for all your support
5,19-04-2021,so good i went back for more,i have completed two qualifications through open colleges and highly recommend  the open space portal for students is very userfriendly and easy to navigate  the support team including the tutors and trainers are fabulous and incredibly helpful
4,17-04-2021,good course,good course the open colleges portal was simple to use there were a few errors in the course work which could confuse less experienced students the time it took to get responses to queries was sometimes frustrating having said that overall my experience was a positive one
5,16-04-2021,loved it,i loved the flexibility of being able to work at my own pace and having help on hand if i needed it the assessors are lovely and easy to understand and the modules are clear and straight forward would always recommend opencolleges for anyone
5,19-04-2021,it was great,it was great
3,13-04-2021,i have finished but not without disappointment,i am please to have finished the course however the wording of the majority of the assessments had to be decoded not a lot was straight forward it was easier to submit assessments i knew were not right just to get better feedback than asking on the forum i believe the forum is for the students to ask questions and receive straight forward answers not generic answers that have already been posted then told to message directly through the message centre for further assistance this really upset me and clearly doesn't help too many people due to the number of times the same question had been asked over the years on the forums was ridiculous if the trainers had just answered it in a way that students understood in the first instance there wouldn't be repeated questions with the same generic answersthe study buddy system having to log into just a get a message is super annoying there should be an application that allows messages to come though without the need to log on every day i often did not log on when i studied as i downloaded everything i did however have to connect through my own social media networks to make it work this is certainly in need of improvementand one more thing students are marked on the nitty gritty of spelling and grammar etc perhaps the course writers and workbook publishers need to do a big overhaul and proofread there own work before judging us on our work
4,09-04-2021,not too challenging,good course work great feedback from assessor
5,08-04-2021,highly recommend,i loved my experience with open colleges  the work was fun yet challenging and i learnt so much the staff at open colleges are very friendly and helpful and were very quick to answer any of my enquiries thanks to open colleges i know have a pay rise at work and a higher position
5,07-04-2021,i've just recently completed my diploma,i've just recently completed my diploma in human resource management online through open colleges my experience as a whole was really good i gained an ample amount of knowledge and skill from the trainingthe trainers are extremely knowledgeable and are ready to assist when required response times to queries was likewise really good from both the trainers and the student support team during my course i encountered some personal family issues the organisation was extremely understanding and i was able to extend my course duration out to help me sort out these issuesopen colleges is very deserving of the  star rating
1,07-04-2021,please never study with open colleges,please never study with open colleges it is the biggest regret i have done they are scammers and all they care about is money they took extra fees from my account for months and blamed it on my bank then back tracked what they said and apologised then kept taking more money   extra every payment there is no student support they will no refund me even though its their fault they take days to reply to emails all they care about is money they make it impossible to cancel from the course and you will have to pay a fee they know theyre doing people wrong yet they get away with itso many people i have read online have also had the worst experience with this company if you are reading this and looking into studying with open colleges please do your research and read more reviews like mine i will never recommend this online college to anyone  they will make you pay a fee the longer you are into your course the more your fee is to cancel they will never admit theyre wrong and some of the replies ive gotten were so unprofessional no matter your circumstances they will overlook it and make you pay to cancel theyre at fault  they got away with it i hope someone takes it to the news so australia knows not to use this company
4,06-04-2021,i found the open space tricky to,i found the open space tricky to navigatealso there seemed to be lots of people involved when experiencing an issue as assessors could not always help as they didnt have access eg i thought id finished but there was a module that had not loaded properly but i could not see that anywhere nor could my assessors
5,06-04-2021,you have been there during the course,you have been there during the course good and hard times giving me support and being patience with the process of the course
5,04-04-2021,the learning experience i had with open,the learning experience i had with open collages has been very positive  i have come away with a national accreditation and found the course to be very current with regards to information and structure within the industry that i was studying  the course is well set out the learning support is very structured and i never felt if i did experience difficulties that i was on my own  i would highly recommend this type of online learning  if you are motivated and stick to your study commitments this is a great way to gain work ready qualifications
1,01-04-2021,please do not study through this,please do not study through this provider they offer 'online support' who can only help with navigation not any actual course content for that you need to book a telephone appointment online which is often a week or more from when you need the help or you can inbox your teacher and hope to hear back in about  days or more after accessing one module and receiving little to no help in progressing if you decide this provider is basically useless to you they can offer you  of your  payment as a refundi have studied through oten however and find them far more supportive and helpful
4,30-03-2021,i really enjoyed doing my course,i really enjoyed doing my course through open colleges i found the course material suitable and useful all assessors were quick to respond to any queries and were a wealth of knowledge i love the fact it is all self paced which helps when managing families etc my only recommendation is there needs to be more support for organising work placement it was extremely difficult to get organisations to respond having a representative from open colleges who could contact the organisation would be helpful
4,30-03-2021,open  colleges provide a professional,open  colleges provide a professional and friendly support to students studying online courses  being a student studying and working fulltime during a pandemic was not an easy hurdle to overcome  i managed to accomplish my studies with help and encouragement from the module assessor and my family
4,29-03-2021,cert iv accountingbookkeeping,overall the cert iv bookkeepingaccounting is a great course and i thoroughly enjoyed it however i think it would be a benefit to student especially those who are new to the fieldgoing through a career change is being a bookkeeper for a mock business where you need to setup the books chart of accounts do receivablespayables bas eom reconciliation etc even though there was a whole module in learning accounting software unless you are familiar with it it was difficult as i had to stop and read the instructions for the next step it would have been good and beneficial if we could actually put what was learnt into practice as an extra assessmentalso getting halfway through myob only then having to learn reckon was not fun and pointless in my view students should be learning all the available software or at least the more popular ones such as xero or myobi had issues with a trainer i had questions with an assessment and i wasted over a week in emails back and forth as her feedback was not making sense it was only when i realised that she was giving feedback for the incorrect assessmentapart from those minor issues i absolutely lives the course and i so excites to start my next venture
4,27-03-2021,once i got my head around open colleges,once i got my head around open colleges format  completing the certificate  in mental health first  modules became easier to complete  the last work place module  was quite involved and unless you have a full time job you will have trouble accessing the information and experiences needed to complete all task  it will take a lot more than  hours  i found open colleges trainers and student support very helpfully and informative
5,25-03-2021,i would highly recommend open colleges,i would highly recommend open colleges to anyone planning on studying the course material is set out in a way that is easy to follow and the assessors and staff are very helpful and understandingi loved studying through open colleges and would consider going through them again should i decided to do more studying
3,24-03-2021,altogether good,studying through open colleges has all the expected pros and cons you can study in your time but that means you need to organise yourself it also means that it can be a bit harder to contact the right people and access the right support because you can't speak directly to anyone that said student support was always quick to respond  it just took a few goes to get my message across altogether i'm glad i decided to do the certificate through open colleges it worked out well because otherwise my course would have been made a lot more difficult or delayed due to the pandemic

4,23-03-2021,online learning at its best,overall the assessors were great and easy to communicate as with the course modulesi did feel however that the assessment was not giving a  real clear direction other than writing self notes from the tip videos suppliedi can see where people can potential struggle coming into this course if they dont have the experiencesometimes i felt like i was grasping trying to understand the task  action requirementsi suppose this is online learning and what is it all about is do your own research

5,17-02-2021,wonderful experience,wonderful experience highly recommended
4,16-02-2021,thanks open colleges just a few points,dear open colleges i learnt so much during my online study experience and appreciated all the support i received as a mature aged tertiary educated student heading back into the workforce i found the online platform was challenging at times to follow uploading scanned signatory pages for work placement etc however student support was very patient and helpful i have gained many it skills huge amount of content and work required each module and repetitive at times and sometimes the feedback from assessors was pedantic however all the content was very relevant and informative luckily i was not in a great hurry to finish the course so length of time for marking was not an issue for me  assessors please send all relevant checklists to supervisorsstudents at the start of placements to make clear your requirements at workplaces regarding manual handling accreditation supervision  co signatures and input into portfolios as students we are often working with a different person every shift and managing a huge workload at home so need  all the guidance we can get to avoid things getting missed or confused both my supervisors at two different workplaces were wonderful but can imagine others not being quite so patient given the year of covid understandable difficulties for assessorsstudentssupervisors and workplacesthe indepth and amount of work required from this particular course must be designed to increase the quality of the care support workers that it graduates as was very challenging and a lot of informationwork involved  well done for the agedcare industry but i would imagine many people would not have the itwritingpractical skills required to complete this course properly  would be interested if there were past courses that were simpler  thankyou to everyone who supported me on my study journey i have secured employment which was my main goal
1,15-02-2021,hands down the worst company,hands down the worst company no support from most of the teachers none or very delayed reply to emails had to remind them to process my diploma after i waited one month already one teacher ignored me and continued to keep failing my work without adding another explanation i went through the complainant method and no action was implemented they do not care if you are not actively studying assignments can be marked up to  weeks later they make everything seem like it is your faultif you would like to have a stress free study path i would highly recommend not to choose open colleges
5,12-02-2021,the course was very thorough,the course was very thorough the tutors were very helpful and easy to reach whenever i had questions i would recommend the course to anyone
3,12-02-2021,it was good in the sense of how fast,it was good in the sense of how fast the assessors replied to messages but sometimes when asking for help you are told to watch webinars and ready the assessment book  even after youve told them you have done both
1,11-02-2021,very stressful and overwhelming,getting information is a constant struggle student support gives conflicting information allowing at least  business days for assessors to reply to an email then finding they don't always actually answer your questions or provide the support that your needing trying to speak with an assessor is like pulling teeth as student support don't seem to like to give out the link to book in a phone call time frames for having assessments marked is a complete joke most of the time the work placement process is a major nightmare with very little if any support you have to be prepared to fight for any support that you may need which makes the whole thing a completely stressful and overwhelming experience
5,09-02-2021,easy to navigate online training,easy to navigate online trainingvery thorough coursework
1,09-02-2021,unconscionable conduct  oc delivers misery not positive experiences,after enrolling in an online course in mid due to chronic illness i was unable to continue and advised oc in writing on   no response  i sent my letter by fax and then followed up with at least four emails  still no response or acknowledgement of my cancellation  i knew i would be subject to a cancellation fee  as i had a direct debit arrangement in place i suspected they would continue to take payments only until the cancellation fee was covered  surprise surprise  they took a further two instalments beyond what they were entitled toin desperation i called them instead a very apologetic ashley tells me that she was 'about to call me' pffft  that old chestnut  i am told i need to complete a formal application for cancellation don't know why when they already have it in writing from me  although furious i complete the form and return it within hours of receiving ita further three emails later i finally receive notification that my cancellation has been accepted on  however no mention of when i would receive a refund of the fees stolen from my accountover a week later i receive another email from the 'cancellation team' what a joke asking for my bank details so that they can refund my 'overpayment'  that was almost two weeks ago  and i'm still waitingprospective students  buyer bewareas any student knows when enrolling you have to part with your deposit instantly from you bank account otherwise 'no enrolment'   but come time to request a refund suddenly there is little or no communication from oc and refunds can literally take months to process assuming you get one at allthis companybusiness has no moral compass  they lack basic courtesy and customer service skills  once you hand over your money that's the last you'll see of it they're not interested in refunding your feesindeed one has to wonder whether a qualification from oc is even legitimate or recognisedtake my advice  learn from my mistake  do not trust open colleges  there are a myriad of other respectable tertiary providers that deserve your supportand if like me you have suffered a loss do what i'm about to do lodge a formal complaint with the accc in the hope this morally bankrupt clearly fraudulent business is investigated and ultimately shut down before too many more innocent and trusting consumers are ripped offi for one am not done yet
4,09-02-2021,overall was a enjoyable experience,overall was a enjoyable experience there were a few glitches in the beginning when my course transitioned to another this meant that it took a lot longer than anticipated to finish staff are very helpful and happy to answer your questions
4,09-02-2021,the assessment instruction videos where,the assessment instruction videos where really helpful however they were only provided on the first few of the modules it would be great if these were available for all of them
5,09-02-2021,i had a great  experience with open,i had a great  experience with open colleges thanks for the support given from beginning to completion of my course highly recommend open colleges to anyone who needs a real online educational experience

3,03-02-2021,there were way too many assessments and,there were way too many assessments and it all took longer than it was expected
5,03-02-2021,just work at it consistently,the reading is dry and intimidating but just push through and jump into the actual assignments don't worry too much if you don't fully understand what you've read at the start it's easier to just start doing the work and learn by doingfeedback on your assignments is detailed and usually pretty quick so the assessors are very helpful to get through the assignmentsi learned a lot of practically useful info and skills in this course that carries over to my unrelated joba positive experience
1,02-02-2021,when you call open college they dont,when you call open college they dont let you speak they are money hungry they tell you the information you already know and not the information you called them about they speak over the top of you and theyre dumb as i swear they need to go back to school
5,04-02-2021,leni is a legend,leni the legend
1,28-01-2021,well i agree to continuing the,well i agree to continuing the enrollment through the phone with the understanding that i only pay a percentage of what i have used in their online system and i pay the  deposit if i don't defer within  days of the agreement  well i already have  taken away from me and i haven't even started the course yet and i haven't even applied for a student id yet
5,03-02-2021,cert  all complete in,the modules were thorough i struggled with  videos that i had to act out and record as i had to do them twice first time i wore a dress similar to a nurses white dress and was told i had to wear professional attair which consisted of black trousers shirt  black shoes so doing it twice annoyed me at the time as i felt that it should of been written in bold and put in an obvious place to see i now work along with other ains that have completed the course in  weeks and they didnt do as much paper work to get their certificate and only paid  compared to my i would like to know why the huge variance in price  paperworkmust  say its great to be over the finishing lineciaolisa dorgan
4,27-01-2021,be aware that studying online is not for everyone,i finished my course online this is not for everyone you will need to be motivated to advance through the material luckily my student assessor was lovely and really helpfuli dont think i would study  online again because you do need the regular interaction with other students and teachers
5,26-01-2021,you can do it,at first i was really hesitant to commence my diploma of community services i actually wanted to opt out but i decided to see how far i could go first i found the whole online experience easier than expected rosan lal was my assessor and he was most supportive he has a wealth of knowledge and really just made me feel confident that i could complete the course in the end it took me  months to smash the course out and im so glad i persevered i recommend open colleges to any one wanting to up skill or learn more about the field their interested in
2,26-01-2021,would not recommend,the content was not engaging and i feel as though there was very little support from open colleges the assessments were also very dull so if you are interested in this course id go elsewhere
4,25-01-2021,a reliable course provider,i found the course hard it was more difficult doing the cert iv than my degree  that was due to it being all online and so required more selfmotivation also on top of full time work and  kids open colleges were good  understanding about the need to extend i felt they were a reliable course provider there were quite a few irritating minor errors typos in the course material but not a big deal
1,24-01-2021,the worst,absolutely disgusting organisation do not study with them go anywhere else zero student support no empathy for hardship or students with difficulties barely any communication has been returned throughout covid refund policy is an absolute joke they just take your money and then pay no attention to you horrible horrible horrible
1,22-01-2021,wont be using open colleges again,unprofessional poor communication understaffed
4,22-01-2021,adult learning is hard especially online,i found it hard going back to study as an adult learner throw in learning online even harder when you need things explained  some of the learning material was not correct and when you asked the assessor responsible for that module you would sometimes not get assistance at allsome of the teachers were amazing with their feedback and explained things clearly when giving feedback on an assessmenti am just thankful i got through this course in  year as i set my goals and achieved them
5,22-01-2021,this course was very enjoyable,this course was very enjoyable all of the assessors as well as the student support team were always very friendly and helpful and i never felt like i was doing this on my own instructions for assessments were always clear and easy to understand with an additional video that contained useful information with each assessment i will strongly recommend studying through open colleges the support and encouragement that i have received throughout my course was greatly appreciated  thank you to everyone at open colleges
4,21-01-2021,i  found open colleges to be very supportive,i  found open colleges to be very supportive all the way through my dip of community services course whenever i needed help they were only an email away the only thing i could say that needs improvement is the length of time it takes to grade assessments but can appreciate the work load of the assessors big shout out to rosan for all his help i would recommend open colleges to anyone
5,20-01-2021,open collages were amazing every time i,open collages were amazing every time i needed help they would help me and gave me feedback that i needed and im glad i went with open collages for my cert  and thank you for everything open collages you guys are amazing
4,20-01-2021,happy with the outcomes,i started the course very worried as academically i struggle and i didnt know how i would cope with it also i lead a very busy lifestyle and i didnt know if i would be able to keep uphowever this course and style of studying was exactly the right fit for me it helped my confidence and i loved the fact that i could do it at my own pace i set small goals and had regular breaks so the course didnt feel like it ruled my lifethe trainers were very helpful and the open space portal was easy to use and navigatemy only wish is that open colleges offered more courses so that i could continue with my next course with them
1,20-01-2021,avoid unless you want to be extremely frustrated,i wanted to complete a certificate in events management and i never had a more frustrating experience in my life unless you can understand all the resources and assignments without any help you're screwed because you'll need to email for help if they ever respondi often ran into grammarspelling mistakes across the modules and many of the resources were broken urls and outdated information you'd have to hope the website was working too because often you weren't able to access your assignments or upload them also don't expect any communication from open colleges apart from automated messages letting you know your course will expire in x amount of monthsnow for the biggest problem that left me pulling my hair work placement do not rely on them to help you in any way i approached opencolleges for support after having no luck finding work placement first they told me to look for virtual events as covid had sent nsw into lockdown but then was told by my support officer that they would not be contacting any potential host organisation because of covid also i never received any information on how the process worked and i just felt more confused every conversation i had with themas my course was reaching expiration i also asked about a possible course extension first they told me to apply for one through the website which didn't work so i had to contact them directly then i was told that my extension was being processed because of my emails more confusionwith covid finally easing and small events going ahead my 'support' officer finally had some potential organisations of course now they insisted that i contact them which was different from what they told me initially on top of that one didn't fit the criteria for work placement and two were in completely different states from me and no they were not doing virtual events or ones near me so out of  potential organisations they sent me  weren't suitable and the rest weren't looking for work placement studentsi ended up not even completing my course and when i asked for my transcripts in case i did want to complete it in the future definitely not with open colleges they said they weren't able to lucky i was able to sort this out with tafe nswso learn from my mistake and go somewhere else because the only thing i learnt from my  year course was that open colleges value profit over education
3,20-01-2021,good but slightly challenging at times,open colleges overall was a good platform for online studying however there were times where you could have a full day of studying planned but get to a roadblock when you need to askdiscuss something with the assessor as unfortunately theres no live chat with them to contact them its over email type message and sometimes it could take a day or two for them to respond to your messagequery this isnt ideal for students who work full time and take off a day dedicated to completing a days worth it is also a bit tough when you need to wait  days for an assessment to be graded when the second assessment follows on from the first this being said all the assessors are extremely helpful and try to help as much as they can and the support team were fantastic helped me out whenever i had a general query or opening up the next module within minutes over the live chati did find that sometimes the questions asked in the assessments werent clear enough especially towards the last module when studying online a bit more guidance and clarification should be put into the assessments so students know exactly what is expected from them especially in research assignments where the information isnt included in the module contentoverall though the portal is easy to use its a great community the staff are friendly its easy to connect with study buddies and you can ask for help when you need ita challenging but good experience
5,20-01-2021,i just completed my diploma in graphic,i just completed my diploma in graphic design the platform works great great support staff and trainers i was granted a couple of extensions due to personal issues and they helped me out so very grateful i got heaps out of the course and i recommend open colleges to anyone looking to study online i'm stoked with my  complete

1,18-01-2021,all enquiries slow to respond or,all enquiries slow to respond or action very little academic help multiple organisations don't accept students from open colleges for work experience
1,17-01-2021,very poor,the fact there is only one assessor is ridiculous the course content is repetitive their should be one module on safety at the start of the course rather than repeating similar questions student support have no course knowledge so the one person that can only answer questions makes it difficult lack of leadership of mamagement has alot to be desired i would not recommend this course at all
5,17-01-2021,enjoyed studying as a mature student,enjoyed studying as a mature student with open colleges they were very understanding and helpful during the covid shutdowns and offered lots of help and extra time to complete studies and practicals
5,17-01-2021,i found the staff to be very helpful,i found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant when i phoned in for help the assessors were also very pleasant to deal with and the content of the course was on point thank you
5,15-01-2021,the course overall has had very,the course overall has had very thorough content for the field i am working in the modules had good detail of practical topics that are relevant for use in most community services organisations the assessors have been very responsive and supportive which has been a good experience to have in an online learning format
4,15-01-2021,good support and content but modules need to be reviews,good support but it would have helped having someone check in every so often as doing online study is hard i understand there was the study buddys but maybe having student support email or call to check in would be beneficial the content was good although i did find that there were multiple spelling errors throughout the modules and alot of the videos you can no longer view for some reason i started writing down which ones initially to relay this information back to oc but lost count early ongreat support and help from my assessors for assignments i found the video webinars for assignments very helpful and beneficial doing more of these throughout the course may help students i really enjoyed studying my course and wish all the assessors support team and students at open colleges all the best thankyou
5,15-01-2021,thank you,the experience was very good and i had help all the way till the end with a full family life juggling studing was made easy by doing it on my time and terms thank you open colleges
5,13-01-2021,e certificate iv in accounting and bookkeeping,open colleges provides a simple to use straight forward learning processthe information is relevant and the assessments professionally constructedi have been most impressed with the support offered by trainers assessors and the student support live chat was a life saver
2,13-01-2021,felt on my own the whole way through,felt on my own the whole way through no one responds to the in house emails quick enough to take the money out your bank every week but when it comes to wanting help no one is interested dont waste you time or money wouldnt recommend at all
3,11-01-2021,oc aod very iv,good content intuitive platform and prompt marking and tutor feedbackmy challenges were largely covid related  this was most telling whilst trying to secure a placement whilst oc places the onus on the candidate to find a place themselves i was not too impressed with the structure in place to help me in thisone area that needs some review is the balance between online modules and swl assignments  i spent so much time discharging assignment tasks whilst on placement i struggled to learn how my host org works can there be more assignments prior to placement and more tasks defined by your workplace supervisor
1,08-01-2021,horribly worthless,what a horribly unprofessional organisation took weeks to respond to my emails about wanting to cancel my course once they finally did respond and say id be payed back what i was owed ive now spent weeks chasing my money only to receive a joke payment of  today will be taking this further what an absolute scam
4,05-01-2021,great course providing good coverage of,great course providing good coverage of relevant subject matter the flexibility offered through an online course was helpful especially for anyone needing to continue with work and every day life commitmentsrecommend teaming up with a study buddy early as this really helps to maintain motivation
4,04-01-2021,trainers were great,trainers were great course content and assessments were relevant to the actual course i studied however sometimes i feel like i enrolled myself into a drama class with the amount of filming and editing required to be submitted but i suppose this is an online course and the trainers do need to visually watch how i would conduct meetings discussions etc overall a good course i also learned how to edit short video clips whilst taking the course and would recommend open colleges to anyone looking at improving their skills
4,29-12-2020,review,a great college to study with however at times there were poor communication and difficult to understand due to bad phone lines and personal accents it became frustrating at times when trying to get in contact with a particular person and not being able to get throughmy assessors were always there when i needed them just took some time to get a response
5,22-12-2020,open colleges offers a first class,open colleges offers a first class online platform and student support for me they were always very attentive with feedback marking and educating and always accessible i couldn't recommend open colleges high enough and will certainly be back for further studies in the future
5,22-12-2020,diploma of building and construction,completed my diploma of building and construction the assessors for the course were extremely helpful the detailed feedback on each question in assessments was helpful for resubmitting answers and for future personal developmentassessments were reviewed and marked quickly always had the option to organise a phone call for a detailed explanation of questions to aid in answering them in better detail will definitely study with open colleges again in the future
5,20-12-2020,very helpful teachers,very helpful teachers very easy to get help on assignments and understand the questions which need to be answered
2,20-12-2020,assessments took a very long time to be,assessments took a very long time to be marked before covid hitwhen needing assistance regarding an explanation of questions to complete and what the questions were asking most assessors gave feedback that mirrored the questions that were hard to understand in the first place to add most assessors aside from one or two took their time responding by email  i would like to mention eliana vogiatzis as the only assessor at open colleges that gave me  support and assistance at all times and who was efficient prompt helpful and understanding towards me and my needs while studyingi commend her professionalism and demeanourthe procedures of submitting in assessments was extremely challenging and difficult not everyone is technically mindedstudent support staff made errors regarding unlocking correct modules and gave incorrect information regarding how much i still needed to complete therefore when i thought i was almost finished my course i then discovered there was additional assessments to be completedmost assessors were very anal about submission of work and were too picky over trivial matters that werent a big deal however delayed marking assessments until these minor details were corrected and i went through the process of then resubmittingwhen i finally completed my course i was told it would take  to  weeks for my diploma to be sent to me after almost  weeks went by i received an email from oc informing me that records of my up to date first aid information needed to be viewed by oc before they could release the diploma to me  why was this request not brought to my attention well before the weeks went by then when i forwarded this information it took another few days for oc to then actually mail the diploma and it was another week after that for me to finally receive it in the mail i was then devastated to see my diploma all bent and twisted in my mailbox aside from stamping a very small message of do not bend on the envelope no other efforts were made to ensure my diploma reached me in good condition example providing a cardboard backing to protect the diploma from being mishandled in the mail instead of only providing a flimsy plastic sleevea disappointing and stressful experience with open colleges in general and therefore i cannot recommend this  service to others
5,19-12-2020,i was so happy,i was so happy with all the help and assistance all the resources were easy to access i am very grateful to have finished my study with you guys
5,19-12-2020,thank you for the opportunity to gain new skils,i have enjoy the course content all teachers and staff were friendly and professional

5,18-12-2020,the whole experience was very good,the whole experience was very good i had lots of support from the team i will definitely recommend the course to anyone i have learned a lot two people i would like to single out holly and peter they were very prompt to respond and me to achieve this goal ahead of time
1,18-12-2020,good support  ok material  placement,the online support was helpful and promptfeedback and support from assessors was usually timely and beneficialcourse material and assessments need some editingsome of the placement tasks were asking a lot of an organisation and student to have a student interview a young person at risk with coexisting issues ask about family and various other triggering topics is potentially dangerous then to have a response of if you can't do it there find another placement is unrealistic a its hard to find a placement and b are you supposed to find a placement just to be able to do a few tasks doesn't sound reasonable
5,17-12-2020,so glad i went through open colleges,i completed my diploma through open colleges i found the platform to be great and was always up and running and there were no glitches or issues that prevented me from doing my work all of the assessors and trainers were easy to contact and got back to me quickly when it got to my final face to face assessment i was really worried having to do it over zoom due to covid restrictions but the assessor rosan made me feel comfortable and relaxed and was really supportive throughout the entire process i cannot recommend open colleges enough i have found employment in the industry i was studying and open colleges supported me in this from start to finish
5,17-12-2020,amazing exeperience,i had a great experience with open colleges and will recommend them to anyone i have also referred many people that i know to them even with the time difference between africa and australia they helped me with all my queries and problems without any faulti have really enjoyed studying through them and i'm considering doing it again
4,17-12-2020,overall positive if you are self motivated and have support for videoaudio assessments,i enjoyed studying with open colleges because it allowed me to go at my own pace each time i needed help student support and the assesors were helpful i probably wasn't expecting to involve friends to help with videoaudio assignments to the extent required but once i got into a rhythm i could organise them reasonably quickly before moving forward i also got a little frustrated when trying to communicate via message system only as there is about a  day time lag for a response and sometimes the question i had was minor but held me back from moving forward the course content was good and able to navigate it with ease
4,15-12-2020,open colleges are great,open colleges are great the team are always there to help support you through your study
4,15-12-2020,supportive staff updated curriculum is better than the old,i changed curriculum towards the end and the updated version is more up to date and relevant than the old  the assessors and student support team are open colleges biggest asset  some appendix items could be easier to find but i feel this is a great value course
1,15-12-2020,they made me sign on for two courses,they made me sign on for two courses then two months later charged me the whole amount and said i could no longer study they now harass me every week and i has asked them to let me study let me complete what i started but no i have to pay and suffer for what they want
5,15-12-2020,great for online learning,i completed the certificate iv in business administration open colleges delivers this course in a very user friendly way i was able to access my account from anywhere in the world i liked that i could pick it up and put it down to suit me i have been working full time and have moved house twice since i started the course and nothing was affected the staff respond to queries or questions very promptly and assessments were marked and sent back within days i would definitely do another course through open colleges
4,12-12-2020,cert iv bookkeeping  accounting,i think some of the units whilst interesting were not at all what i was expecting  perhaps having a choice of elective options might be more useful  i also felt that more review and practise of the first few modules would have been helpful as this is what most people well me undertook the course to learn  balance sheets pl budgets payroll bas arap more exposure to these topics further along the course would be helpful as refreshersenhancers  having said that i learned a lot and the trainers and assessors were very helpful  studying this course from interstate was frustrating with the time difference and working fulltime  generally happy though and would recommend the course
5,11-12-2020,i really enjoyed studying with open,i really enjoyed studying with open colleges the lectures guided me throughout every step for completing this course the student support team helps me whenever i was stuck in any suitable regarding acedamically or  practical workplacement or any other it matters the lecturer response time is very quick in reply and as students i have asked many questions and they never hesitated to reply me back while doing this course with there guidance and support it helped me choosing the right pathway ahead for my further studies now i am confident to acheive my further goals and studiesthank you very much open colleges
5,10-12-2020,very professional accessors always,very professional accessors always there to help you for your assessment and student support nice and friendly
5,09-12-2020,based on my recent experience cert,based on my recent experience cert  dental assisting recruitment  student support  helpful and replied in timely manner for my queries due to covid the course was extended and also when i asked for extension gave them valid reason they didnt hesitate to extendassessor fiona  she was excellent helpful and friendly made me feel at ease and the study experience a lot more enjoyable
1,08-12-2020,deceptive and misleading conduct,this company does not operate  ethically their terms of business  offer refunds at withdrawal from the course i have written confirmation from open colleges confirming  i am entitled to a refund but they wont pay it every week they have a different excuse it seems the company is not fiancially secure as they dont have the money to make  the refund their director even lied to the office  of fair trading saying they had refuend me absloute liesbuyer beware
1,07-12-2020,steer clear of open colleges,i wouldnt recommend open colleges to anyone  the poor service starts with the high pressure sales pitch to get you to enrol with minimal information supplied about how it all works the support you get or the course contentthen from the onset of the course there is no support at all  i realise its an online course but there is no follow up  ever  no one rings or emails to ask how ur going or if you need help  i had over  months off for personal reasons and no one checked to see why  and then when i came back and emailed and requested help no help came  i also phoned and asked and no help came  i got  extensions which they happily took my money for but didnt ask why and again no help camethe course material is poorly written and lacks substance  the links often dont work or direct you to pages that are out of date the assessments are extremely unprofessional with spelling and grammatical errors everywhere links dont work even the font type and size change mid document  often statements and assessment questions are contradictory or dont make sense  and the project mngt unit is written for real estate agents when im studying interior design  how hard is it to ensure its relevant to the subject youre studyingthe lecturers are very hard to contact and will only answer through open space and sometimes it takes a week to get an answer on something  assessment feedback has often had another students name on it and you can tell its cut and pasted from someone elses assessment  im not sure my diploma is worth the paper its written on and have very little faith that its of any value to an employer in the real world  very very disappointing  i will never study through them again and i certainly wouldnt recommend them
1,05-12-2020,i find it way hard,i find it way exacerbated the subject and context formulated and very unclear what the request asking me to do also compare with university and other branches and other options who finished uni in educational says open college is so hard to understand the subjects to many photos and activities requirements which it make very hard and discomfort for student to complete the requirements and expectations with covid open college didnt abustle the subjects to meet the restrictions in delivering the task such as portfolios when requires preparation of food or sensory activities where water play dough slime etc has been banned from child care open college didnt took this in considerationone of big issues was with the trainers exempt lyndal w athens was unhelpful for example if i asked questions they answered back  thank for richie me have a nice day or not explaining anything clear another example with my portfolio task some of the trainers doesnt know well the program as they cant check on student if the gave to do that particular task or not if thats part from electives or not if that is student chooses subjects or not if the task is unlocked or not i have that issue to get back feedback that the portfolio is unsatisfactory bcz the stasis are not complete which she should have checked before mark out the portfolio however there was good things to such as help le out with extended my course when i needed
4,05-12-2020,allied health assistant,good experience with open colleges providing timely support and guiding at every level of difficulty quite helpful and cope up with all situations giving valuable feedback administration and academic staff  both are cooperative and giving fruitful support
5,04-12-2020,open college has been very helpful and,open college has been very helpful and supportive throughout my course the college the student support  the teachers and everyone were very responsive and encouragingthank you so much
3,04-12-2020,the course material needs to be,the course material needs to be reviewed and updated  some links to resources do not worki finished the course more than  months ago and i am still waiting for my certificate
4,04-12-2020,flexible and understanding,bit of a rigid extension request process but i am totally grateful that they have staff that consider real life kids work housework travel etc and how we fit in schooling into that chaos they enabled me a very busy mum to complete the course successfully thank you
5,03-12-2020,lecturers were all very approachable,lecturers were all very approachable and marked assignments well within the allowed time frame all feedback whether positive or negative was useful course work was generally good although there were multiple mistakes in the course material such as spelling mistakes which came across as rushed and not as professional as would have been expected this could be due to the changes in the course halfway throughall questions were answered well and were helpful and were given in a reasonable time changing from the original course where you needed to find people to help with videos to the new course where you videos onto the website was a great improvement as it was impossible to find willing people who understood what was expected of themsome if the modules had videos to explain what was expected which was helpful particularly to those with different leaning types such as audio style of learningit was a well run course with brilliant lecturers who were always willing to help i would recommend it
4,03-12-2020,review from a mature aged student,i found  of the course to be excellent and have gained a lot of knowledge throughout the course  your assessing team are awesome and give excellent help  i found support give very timely responses to queries the one thing i feel needs improvement is letting students know in advance about the number of videos they will have to submit throughout the course  it would help to know what type of video editing software there is available such as videopad and a few tips on editing would also help  it wasn't until half way through the course that i found suitable software and this made the course a lot easier to manage
5,02-12-2020,review,awesome experiences with open collegesschool of health excellentsupportive  educator administrative staff and other coordinatorsi would like to recommend open collegeschool of health  to everyone who wish to be an enrolled  nurse
1,01-12-2020,poor support with very slow response,poor support with very slow response timescourse out dated and many links go nowhere
5,30-11-2020,loved how i could work at my own pace,loved how i could work at my own pace and when i needed help or clarification the trainers were always very helpful
1,30-11-2020,the worst online learning platform,the worst online learning platform they are money hungry and do not care about their studentsi requested to leave my course after already paying  stating that they could keep what i had paid i just couldnt afford to pay anymore because of financial hardship and they refused to let me do so unless i claimed bankruptcy they encouraged an  year old to claim bankruptcy if i wanted to stop any further paymentsabsolute disgrace of a school as my parents who are both pensioners had to help me pay the rest of my course that i didnt even get to completeshame on you open colleges
5,28-11-2020,wonderful experience,the cert iv in allied health assistance was very enjoyableopen colleges presented the material well and has structured the course so that you could manage your progress effectively there was always support when i needed it and their online portal made it easy to connect with other students doing the course
5,27-11-2020,greatful experience,had the best experience studying with open colleges the support i got from student support and my lectures is unexplainable the went above and beyond to make sure i graduated and for that im greatful
4,27-11-2020,insightful and helpful,insightful and helpful learnt a lot throughout the course the teachers helped as i needed it which was great although on one of my assessments i believe i was marked incorrectly as there was no real constructive criticism other than that i would recommend open colleges
5,26-11-2020,great college,open colleges were imformative supportive and amazing and helpful
5,25-11-2020,my experience with open colleges,open colleges and all the early childhood education trainers and assessors assisted me during my journey i am not a disciplined person and i also i was not sure about my career goals after moving to australia however i found with them motivation flexibility and empathy specially with the assessor georgina antoune who sent me messages that made me keep going and guided me with value knowledge i already recommended the course for a friend who is having a similar great experience and i will continue to recommend open colleges as it is a platform that looks to each student considering and listening to their history and conditions i felt respected supported and motived to create amazing paths to my career thank you to all open colleges team
5,25-11-2020,i finished the diploma of building and,i finished the diploma of building and construction here and have gained alot of knowledge i would recommend people doing this course
4,24-11-2020,i really enjoyed doing my course,i really enjoyed doing my course through open colleges the trainers were very helpful and friendly i learnt a lot and appreciated the hands on tasks making it easy to transition into working in the child care industryjust a few suggestions from my  months studying with open collegesmy percentage on the homepage never reached  even once complete as this includes units im not required to complete which was a bit confusing going along and anticlimactic once finishedit would be useful if once a module was graded and completed the module circle displayed a tick or changed colour or similar to keep track of what was completed and what was outstanding easily and quicklyhaving the option to add push notifications or get an email when there is a message in the message centre this would be useful as i sometimes went days without checking and had outstanding messages waiting without knowing ithaving the option to get reminders throughout the course i appreciated being able to work at my own pace and set my own deadlines but it also became too easy to slack of at times so for example if there was a reminder message sent if nothing had been uploaded for  weeks saying its been  weeks since you've uploaded anything team up with a study buddy or speak to your trainers if you need any help etc would be good motivation while still working at your own pace
2,23-11-2020,frustrating and stressful experience,although i thoroughly enjoyed the topic cert lll in individual supportdisability and graduated the course it wasn't without a huge amount of stress and frustration caused by a lack of responsivess and professionalism from my socalled trainer throughout the year i felt totally unsupported from the start forced to navigate blindly through the course waiting days for a reply or not getting any reply at all regarding academic questions planning a zoom video call or getting my assessments marked getting my work placement approved  weeks after starting it when lodged  weeks earlier not getting my checkpoint calls during the work placement not getting the phone call i had booked to ask questions ending up having to do the workplace observation via zoom video  months after i had finished the placement simply because the trainer seemed to never properly read my emails and follow our conversations and the list goes on i noticed from the start it seemed there wasn't enough trainers for the large amount of students so i tried to be understanding and patient but it was only when i ended up lodging a formal complaint after so much frustration that things seemed to move a little faster even though it still took another  months which i paid as extension waiting to do the zoom video and for the trainer's last report to graduate the content of the course on the portal was very interesting but many links were unavailable and in need to be updated the assessments were very stimulating but all in all i would not recommend open colleges as the whole experience was very stressful when it could have been an enjoyable one
5,23-11-2020,open colleges where easy and great to,open colleges where easy and great to use they where very helpful and was always there when i needed help with my work or could assist me in any way
2,22-11-2020,i really struggled with learning online,i really struggled with learning online and have discovered this learning style is not for me as i need someone there to answer my questions face to face and found that some assesses when asked to do a call to assist they would prefer you look over everything again and again rather then organise a call as for people who can learn this way i think it is great majority of the assessors were really helpful and assisted when needed and everything is there for you studying wise
3,20-11-2020,the resources and assessments need to,the resources and assessments need to be review regularly  links no longer work people had also left comments but no action was taken to fix any errors
2,20-11-2020,the communication from the coordinates,the communication from the coordinates was less than satisfactory this poor communication led me to wasting  on rpl that was never going to be achievable had i spoken to the assessor from module  earlier i wouldnt have wasted my time on trying for an rpl and i would have found doing the assessments much easier i found the communication on most of the assessments vague resulting in anxiety over submitting and what i feel as wasted time in having to resubmit i also fund the structure of the whole course to be a waste but i think that would be the case regardless of who i studied withand can understand why qualified bookkeepers have absolutely no knowledge when they have been employed in the past i only did the course to substantiate my  years of experience
5,19-11-2020,i enrolled in a certificate iv in accounting and bookkeeping,i enrolled in a certificate iv in accounting and bookkeeping and finished the course within two years the opportunity was there to finish the course much earlier even within six months as the course is selfpaced  which i love the course work is very systematic and easy to follow the systems are good the trainers are very helpful and there are many resources available for support and help if you would like it although i didn't avail myself of these i loved being able to login and do the course work in my own time without all the additional time expense and inconvenience of commuting and having to be at a physical location i highly recommend open colleges
5,18-11-2020,really enjoyed the course and the,really enjoyed the course and the trainer assessors really helped when needed

3,14-11-2020,i was happy with the course material,i was happy with the course material however most links were outdated and wouldnt open i then had to search for sites myself which took extra time help was always provided by open space  placement was easy to obtain the placement assessor was very friendly however their visit was short which resulted in the inability to perform all tasks required and meant i had to go out of my way to provide additional information which took extra time due to the knowledge and skills i gained through the course i was employed by the childcare centre i did my placement with on the rd day during my placement thank you open colleges
5,12-11-2020,modules were easy to follow and,modules were easy to follow and supportive documents easy to accessopen colleges were extremely compassionate when i needed extensions  when marking assessments they were super efficient and supportive
4,12-11-2020,the course provided by oc is practical,the course provided by oc is practical and suitable for my learning  the assessors are very professional and their responses are surprisingly prompt however the student support section can be inconsistent the online chat is great but the request made through student support does not receive a reply  therefore not knowing whether any action has been taken overall i am happy i went with oc
1,11-11-2020,open colleges is simply a trap,if it is possible l will rate this trap called open colleges minus  stars this institution is simply a trap i am appealing to the public prospective or candidate intending to enroll in this college to think twice beware  once you are enrolled you are trapped they respond negatively when you decide to withdraw or cancel your enrollment due to the financial problem caused by the covid pandemic and in spite of not taking a single course they then resort to chasing the victim around using a debt collector shame on you open colleges all you are interested in is money  to the detriment of student shame on you
5,10-11-2020,i found open colleges to be extremely,i found open colleges to be extremely supportive during my time of study and i would definitely consider studying through them again
5,10-11-2020,i have been studying with open colleges,i have been studying with open colleges for  months they have been great the content was current and thorough feedback was positive and results received quickly student support was available when i needed it i have enjoyed studying with open colleges and recommend them highly
4,09-11-2020,open colleges gave me the opportunity,open colleges gave me the opportunity to study at my own pace but the support wasnt always there not always clear and the timeframe was all over the place i could see a assessor on my hub that i was told left months ago at times i got my results super quick and other times took  weeksoverall i would recommend open colleges very happy to have completed to course
2,09-11-2020,awful experience,awful experience had a nightmare trying to speak to someone about anything staff who dont know anything about what is going on or your course had money taken out of my account over  after my course had been paid for already took months to get back on good point is fiona my tutor who was invaluable do not use this company poorly written content also
5,09-11-2020,diploma at open collages,after reading all the negative reviews after i enrolled i was a little worriedi can only account for the experience i had the trainers were very responsive assignments were marked with reasonable turn around at times it did take a little longer however that was communicated through the discussion groups the content was very relevant with a mixture of reading as well as videos i had a great experience studying diploma of community service at open collages and i would definitely study with open collages again
4,07-11-2020,efficient and timely marking of,efficient and timely marking of assessments including useful feedbackat times the phrasing of questions were overly vague and caused confusion with some that could be answered in several waysassistance was also provided simply and very quicklythe online platform is easy to navigate
5,06-11-2020,very lovely study place,i really enjoyed the whole studying and my assessor was very lovely and helpful
5,06-11-2020,i found the layout of the learning,i found the layout of the learning materials easy to access and understand staff were friendly and helpful would recommend this training organisation to anyone interested in developing there skills
2,05-11-2020,the response time for my final report,the response time for my final report was over a monthall my work was submitted and and marked by the  i then contacted my course assessor to see why i was still sitting on  to then be told that she was on leave until the th of that month and would look at it thenim with my course expiring on the th of that month i had to apply for an extension  which when i contacted open space help desk  i was given this extension free of chargeas of the th of this month i had still heard nothing from my assessor i then contacted her and asked how much king we it would be and she finished me off that nighti then did not receive a congratulation email and transcript until i phoned and asked for itvery disappointed with the end process
3,05-11-2020,review,i found that the waiting time between submitting an assignment and getting feedback to be too long there were times were i could not progress because i was waiting for feedback my practical placement assessor was the quickest turn around which i appreciated i would recommend your course but feel that there should have been more content in the speech pathology unit as when i started my placement even after completing all the theory i had to be taught a lot of basic speech therapy techniques and disorders i feel the course did not prepare me for the basics of working in a practice in regards to actual therapy
5,04-11-2020,this certificate iv in veterinary,this certificate iv in veterinary nursing by open college has allowed me to reach a goal and standard within this chosen field i could not be happier with how this course was structured and the trainers involved with feedback on any given assessments meant i was able to get a better understanding of the task and improve on what i hadhighly recommended if you are working full time but still want to change your line of work or just update your skill set open colleges allows for you to work within the hours you can achievewould definitely do another course with this company
1,03-11-2020,my experience with studying through,my experience with studying through open colleges has been absolutely ridiculous so far the portal they use is hard to navigate as there is often broken links throughout all of the modules i have gone through most of the assessment questions are very poorly worded and difficult to understand as if the assessors who wrote them hardly proof read their work when i have asked for help the response i get often leads to me feeling even more lost the assessors even seem to struggle explaining the questions and how to go about answering them more times than not they are no help at all even messaging for help with navigation is a joke because the responses i have gotten are abysmal as if the people answering the question dont even know where to find certain thingsif i knew the whole experience was going to be like this i never would have signed up complete waste of time and money
5,03-11-2020,the course material is comprehensive and all staff patient and helpful,the course material even though extensive reading is comprehensive and contributes well to the quiz and assessments the training manager is patient and explains articulately what is required plus communicates well with the assessors  the assessors are also patient and explain until you clearly understand  the webinars are super helpful and in detail  examples are always very helpful and of course there are exercises to assist along the way there is no denying accounting is a difficult course with financial formulas hence a financial calculator is required to purchase and learn
1,03-11-2020,i never do this but i am writing this to urge you not to even consider open colleges,i never do this but i am writing this to urge you to reconsider ever pursuing a course with open collegesmany people within the course i started went through the exact same thing  support students left to fend for themselves through a portal with broken links and poor communication paths just like multiple other students were completely lost and ended up abandoning the course as we could not get help the teachers couldn't even explain the questions within the first assessment worst part is the course is supposed to provide knowledge on how to help members of the community i wonder how many great people out there this flawed arrangement has turned away from the industryno refund  spent and not even so much as a phone call to follow up support after nothing submitted or follow up to see how the course was going didn't submit a single assessment and still could not re enrol to start and try againgenuinely believe some of this is designed to be a scam be very careful read the paperwork you signwould be great if the accc got to poking around at this system designed for you to fail but they will still take your moneydo not get trapped by the ability to pay the course off  speak with employer or tafe learning institute about optionswriting this not because just i lost over  within this joke of a system but so many others that enrolled in my course and other horror stories in other courses i have heard

5,09-10-2020,it was a great experience with open,it was a great experience with open colleges thanks for the support from trainers and student support staff team
3,07-10-2020,overassessed and frustrating,the horticultural course content was worthwhile detailed and relevant to the current australian industry the online resources were well designed and easy to navigatehowever the course assessment schedule was onerous and repetitive and the marking was needlessly pedantic and slow too many assessments per subject made for a relentless  tasks out of a possible  to complete my qualification  surely overkill for a certificate iilocking students out of later units was another aggravating practice this made it difficult to speed up my progress through assessments during periods when i did have extra time available adult learners especially online students need the flexibilty to control their pace of learning and to see the scope and sequence of upcoming assessments to plan how to fit them in around other commitmentsi usually enjoy learning but i found this course degenerated into an unpleasant and frustrating grind through excessive assessment tasks
4,06-10-2020,great support and easy to follow content,i have found the support over my course to be amazing easy to use content i would highly recommend open colleges for anyone looking at on line studies
4,06-10-2020,new to study,the time it takes to have your assessments graded was extended out to  weeks which was quite frustrating but i was able to unlock the next module so i didnt lose too much time i found it took a few days to get a response from trainers applying for an extension was super easy and affordable my overall experience with my course has been great the modules were very interesting and i have been told i am using my new skills which are working well for my team

5,03-10-2020,i love how everything can be done at,i love how everything can be done at the students own pace it really helps with managing stressdo not remove the percentage completed table on the main page the helped so much with knowing how much had been completedi do suggest possibly emails once an assessor has marked work
5,03-10-2020,easy to navigate portal and material,easy to navigate portal and material was great great service and flexibility
1,02-10-2020,the diploma of social media marketing,the diploma of social media marketing  poor quality course old information broken links to reference material poor grammar and full of typing errors all that aside this course will not differentiate you in the market nor make you a social media expert the course is way too high level and half of it isgeneral business the college was in breach of contract as promises made about what the course would deliver were brokenthe support for the course was poor and the administration and oc culture was unprofessional and below parso many students formally complained about our course  a group of  raised formal complaints in a page letter and we were met with red tape sneered at and sarcastically told good luck with that when we threatened to take our complaint furtheropen colleges has a poor reputation i do not recommend them i only wish id known about trust pilot before i signed up
5,02-10-2020,open colleges were very good with,open colleges were very good with helping me with explaining the things i didn't really understandthe assessors were excellent and they were also very helpful in helping me pass my assessmentsthanks open colleges  my first real qualification and it being on a piece of paperlolwhat a thrill
1,01-10-2020,no course fees listed rude and unhelpful,rude and unhelpful on the phone and hung up on me when i insisted on asking the cost before hearing the sales pitch
1,29-09-2020,dont sign up with opencolleges scam,if i could give zero star rating i woulddo not sign up  this is the worst platform to study with i was completely scammed i paid over  for a  course with nothing to show for even though i was informed that i was paying for a bundle course which included a cert ivthey have a day turn around period with having assignments marked dont hold you breath because it took months and months for several of my assignments to be marked which i have evidence of student support never have any answers no one has a clue on whats going on this platform needs to be shut down immediately they are a scam and dont consider how taking money from people is detrimental to their families or ones wellbeing
1,29-09-2020,your website is shocking,your website is shocking all the links are years old and broken no one monitors this despite many comments saying they need to be fixed i missed out on all sorts of resources because of this
2,28-09-2020,disorganised,disorganised unresponsive and constant changes
3,26-09-2020,the educators were very helpful and,the educators were very helpful and generous with their time however many link in the course materials werent working and assignments often took a long time to be marked and returned
2,24-09-2020,trainer rosan lal was the best thing about oc,experience with this provider was poor no indication upon sign up that the fiji work placement was no longer going ahead hard to reach relevant people to speak to about itsome assignments were very vague in their asking what it is they were wanting from yousome assessors didnt get back to youtheir open space portal was good however some material didnt work videos links etcthe best part about studying with open colleges was the trainer rosan lal informative knowledgeable put you at ease and he did answer any queries
3,22-09-2020,could be better,the course was extremely confusing from enrollment process up to the end studying materials are raw assessments are misleading and contain heaps of spelling mistakes although staff members and educators are very friendly and helpful
4,16-09-2020,at times i found the direction not,at times i found the direction not specifically clear
4,16-09-2020,course complete,i found the structure of this course very well i found it hard not being able to contact the assessor direct and having as waiting for a reply to an email was frustrating as i was unable to continue on with the assessment overall happy with the feedback
4,16-09-2020,cert iv allied health assistant,i found it very helpful that my course was all online and there was no due dates this allowed me to get heaps of work done when i had time but it didn't matter when i was really busy and couldn't study at alli found many of the assessment questions difficult to interrupt but the course content was interesting and relivanti recommend asking as much as you can about work placements and being really prepared as there is a lot to get done onsite during placementstudents do need to be self motivated as although the trainers and accessors were all very helpful and encouraging their support is limited
5,15-09-2020,open colleges were excellent,open colleges were excellent the assistance i received and the course content were exceptional due to the covid i experienced extensive work experience delays however oc were always there to answer queries and put my worries to restthey were very supportivethank you
1,14-09-2020,scam please do yourself a favour and never,please do yourself a favour and never study with open colleges they only care about your money hard to study as most of their material is old and unavailableyou try and get help and they take weeks to get back to you hard to learn and get a good education when it takes them so long to get back to you when i enrolled i got a call within the hour when i had to leave due to serious health problems in the familyno one called me despite begging them to call me to discuss why they wouldn't give me money back i sent them many emails and even wrote a letter and it got me absolutely no where they sent me an email saying they would no longer speak with me as they have done everything they can they have kept over  for 'administrative' purposes please take your money elsewhere you will only be let down by open collegesi have reported them to a current affairs please do the samehorrible experiencescam
1,14-09-2020,very disappointed,very disappointed in the course i did with open colleges the assessments were terribly explained  full of errors all assessments contained spelling errors  the trainers were not easily contactable or helpful open colleges were quick  great with contact at the start while i was interested  looking at signing up however as soon as they had my money contact heavily changed  pretty well stopped only bonus about open colleges is the ability to do the course at your own pace which is great for me as i work full time i wont be recommending anyone to open colleges  recommend for anyone looking into studying with open colleges to do your research heavily  as i wish i had done this
1,13-09-2020,needs a lot of improvement,the only good thing about the course was that it was online and at my own pace otherwise it was a tedious experience the course itself was not what we were led to believe it was by the onboarding staff it was just basic marketing with the occasional touch on social media the content was difficult to understand and riddled with spelling mistakes and broken links to youtube videos the trainers could only offer very minimal support even after some of the modules were updated due to a large number of student complaints it still has a long way to go i would never recommend anyone study with open colleges after my experience
3,13-09-2020,feel as if the trainers had to help me because the resources and assessments were not very good,not very good resources for training half of the links were expired and trainers would just send you the same link which also has no website page foundassessments were very difficult to understand questions were very broad and i had to follow the webinars to be able to understand them layout of training is quite boring it was hard to stay interested could be useful to have some webinars discussing some particular subjects one of the readings in study period  had the wrong grammar for a and an it was difficult to readi would have liked to have received my text book earlier as soon as i had this it was a fantastic resources to get me through assessments and my portfoliothe only thing good about this course was the trainers who supported mei did make it in the end and have already secured a position as a veterinary nurse with an amazing veterinary team
5,12-09-2020,happy with the service from trainers,happy with the service from trainers and support fantastic i would love to be graded properly rather than just either satisfactory or unsatisfactory there is no distinction between someone who only just passed with minimal content and someone who worked extremely hard with all factors and points presented in assessments
5,09-09-2020,how amazing open colleges are,open colleges are amazing they help you if you need help support you need support they teach you to be the an amazing nurse  i highly recommend enrolling in open colleges thankyou for all you have done for me
4,08-09-2020,this was a well prepared course and i,this was a well prepared course and i enjoyed doing it
2,08-09-2020,track rpl documents via post to avoid disappointment,posted rpl documents via australia post due to being hundreds of pages and lucky i had tracked the document as open colleges would take no responsibility for receiving this despite australia post advising it had been collected this took more than  months to sort out with each time i called someone promising to call back but never did it was only after i demanded to speak with the manager that it miraculously appeared on someone's desk and then having wait another  months for the rpl's to be approved it was an extremely painful process i would be hesitant to study with open colleges again as it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth from my experiences with them
4,07-09-2020,open colleges has been great,open colleges has been great the support staff are amazing and help you through every stepthe course material is thorough but could have more varied experiences beyond reckonone a lot of business stuff which was interesting but thought there could be more complex accounting and bookkeeping work as the landscape in the real world changes so oftenit was hard to complete whilst working full time but super interesting work and i loved the flexible nature of the course the feedback was helpful on assignments however it would be an incentative to be graded on a scale not just satisfactory or not
1,07-09-2020,i had the worst experience with,i had the worst experience with themafter only  week of deciding not to continue the course i find out i have to pay  for only  week enrolement which is a cost of studying a courseeven they knew i am a single mum and have hardshipthey made me pay the money with zero discounti don't recommend at all and already told few friends were planing to study with themits all about business for them as not even big universities have such a policy and they give you  month to figure out if you made the right decision how can we find out in  days when its not much studying going on that you are chose the right course so its about making money not giving people the opportunity to study with themvery disappointingi'm sorry for whoever put this policy in place and make students to pay this amount of money
4,06-09-2020,good for fulltime worker,suitable for busy people who are working full time and can tailor their studying to suit them some content was outdated and the placement was very tick boxyimpacting a natural development of skills over the hours required staff were nice and supportive and responsive
4,06-09-2020,i found the course very good the only,i found the course very good the only problem i had was when it came to doing my practical hours  i was not advised that i would have to ring and book in times for the assessor  it was not until i rang near the end of my hours that i rang to find out when someone would be contacting me i found this process very cumbersome
1,05-09-2020,review,hias much as i appreciate the concept of online learning and open colleges as an institute this course cert iii in fitness has been the worst educational endeavour i have ever experienced firstly majority of the content that is required to complete had little to no relevance in my placement this left me questioning the subject matter implemented and i was left wondering why did i have to go through  modules of theory just to use maybe  modules in my practical work further why was there such an expectation to conduct on such diverse populations how can you expect students to apply concepts like preexercise screenings training programs and diverse interactions with individuals that are disabled different faiths or have severe health conditions what regular gym will allow people with such unfortunate circumstances train without the adequate supervision and help i had to search and reach out to an abundance of people i knew through prior life experiences just to meet these ridiculous placement standards why not just have a list of gyms that accomodate for these individuals and make placements happen there secondly the feedback given by the assessors led to copious amounts of personal frustration why were questioned marked as unsatisfactory if one or two words were left out of answers why were certain training programs marked as unsatisfactory if they were not quite correct from a textbook perspective even though in real life experience have been proven to be effective it was very frustrating to submit programs that took inspiration from qualified strength and conditioning coaches just to have them knocked back also why is there such a low expectations of how individuals can train in the gym saying statements like four sets of twelve squats is too high volume for a male adolescent looking for hypertrophy how why thirdly the promise of a  business day turn around for marking was almost never followed through for some assessments i had to wait up to a month and a half for feedback this led to what i thought would be a sixeight month course turning into around a twoyear ordeal i had peers that completed their certificate iii and iv in less time than that finally i'm unsure if this was something stated at the start of the course but why is there little to no help with the expiry date of the course my course expired and there the only reason i was allowed a special extension is due to a medical emergency i experienced in the duration of the course when the course expires nothing is said or done to help people complete their course if people pay three grand for the course and don't complete it does your institute just take the money and send the poor student packing sorry to be so meanspirited but these experience was so frustrating and i hope no one else goes through the same events i did however it is not all doom and gloom as some of your staff were very nice and helpful i just think your institute needs to reevaluate your structure policy and content required to complete
2,04-09-2020,disappointed,i was very excited to be starting my veterinary nursing certificate and was so happy that i could have a chance to complete it online but i was very disappointed with how the course was set out and didn't get a huge amount of supportit was really difficult to communicate with people that worked at open colleges and found it difficult to complete work placement with the paper work and trying to email it off and get a response in a adequate amount of timei wouldn't recommend this course to friendsas happy as i am that i have now completed my study i am still quite disappointed
5,04-09-2020,open colleges had an easy online,open colleges had an easy online platform and trainers responded quickly
5,03-09-2020,i really enjoyed learning through open,i really enjoyed learning through open colleges i found the trainers very supportive helpful and friendly  i also found my assessor's portfolio webinar very helpful and really appreciate the support the college offers for assessments

4,01-09-2020,the only thing i thought could be,the only thing i thought could be improved on is the turn around time for marking and extension requests
5,01-09-2020,amazing,very happy with all the assessors and assistance support all of them very helpful thank you very appreciate it
5,31-08-2020,fantastic support and highly recommend,i have just compleated my diploma through out the whole experience i felt fully supported and have to say that rosan was always responsive to everything i asked and followed up immediately i have gained new skills and really enjoyed open colleges open space the study style catering to most peoples study styles highly recommend studying with open colleges
5,28-08-2020,my experience with open colleges he been fantastic,my experience with open colleges has been nothing but positive  i have always had access to help and support when needed  it has been very self explanatory and easy to navigate  i am a mature age student and it has enabled me to use the course content to gain more experience and knowledge in my current job  im excited to have finished and to be able to use it in my future career paths
1,28-08-2020,do yourself a favour and pick another,do yourself a favour and pick another school they promise a bouch of help before hand and when you require to them to in fact help you with placement they won't also their assessor's are absolutely rude to students i wasted my time and money on this hole
5,27-08-2020,open colleges you are five stars above,open colleges you are five stars above the rest  thank you for wonderful tutorialsfriendly and helpful staff  i had a wonderful time learning at your college and this made my placement easy because what i learnt at the college is excactly what i found during my pep i am pleased to let you know that my placement  home were quite pleased by my peformance that i have been offered a job thank you open colleges i would recommend you to anyone who care to listen  thank yo
2,27-08-2020,there is inconsistency among the,there is inconsistency among the grading given by assessors almost as thought there is no communication among assessors regarding marking standards one assessor in particular is excessively critical of submitted work and always takes longer than the allowed time to respond to submissions once the requested changes were made a further extended waiting period was endured sometimes this would go on for up to  resubmissions with a  week wait between each submission the hold ups caused by this assessor caused great stress and caused me not to complete my study in time and required extensions of my course after all the resubmission for this assessor the usual mark achievable was a pass or credit all other assessors gave distinctions or high distinctions for my work without requiring any resubmission most markers were very helpful and prompt with their marking and advice but it doesnt change the fact that one was able to make my study an overwhelmingly negative experiencei also found it very unprofessional that i was assured before signing up that a  month extension would be possible at the end of the course if needed this turned out not to be true i had to fight for each extension of two months and only two were granted this required me to take leave without pay from work which was most inconvenient as much time had already been lost from work due to coronavirus where as a casual teacher i received no pay for a  week period having to take further time off to complete the course before my cut off date has greatly affected my finances and quality of lifei would be very reluctant to recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to study and in fact i am an advocate with first hand experience against studying with open colleges
1,26-08-2020,not a good experience,poor communication taking weeks sometimes to get a reply having to message the same thing several times so they actually answered the question askedhorrible organisation many places would not take on open collages for placement as oc were to hard to deal with
3,26-08-2020,i have found doing my diploma of,i have found doing my diploma of community services challenging and rewarding some of the most frustrating aspects of studying online include the lack of interaction the  slowness of response time by trainers when you need assistance some assessments took longer for trainers to assess having said this the feedback was always helpful and focused resubmissions are a nightmare to upload and student support were unable to assist with this aspect the coursework itself could have been more engaging the requirements of the work placement are not clear  in fact they are very confusing the responsiveness of trainers to emails and enquiries could be improved
5,30-08-2020,great overall,very easy to use website i had no issues did their free professional communications course that was offered and will be back for paid courses soon
5,26-08-2020,i loved studying with open colleges,i loved studying with open colleges the course work was very informative and easy to follow

1,25-08-2020,open collages has been a nightmare to,open collages has been a nightmare to terminate a course plus payment even during these had times of covid they have forced me to pay out the course i no longer can attend to due to illness and stressful timesi highly recommend future students to think twice about enrolling and if you ever wanted to get out you will be bullied into paying for something you cant afford or attend tovery very disappointed

1,25-08-2020,the help was less than poor,the help was less than poor if i had trouble  i would message the trainers who would most times four days to respond to the message so would have to go else where to find hep for the course when the chat was open i never got responses to the help i need on it and then it was not even working what so ever that was from the beginning of the course through the whole  months the course took i will be referring nobody to open colleges

5,17-08-2020,i found the training as supportive as,i found the training as supportive as it can be for online learning while i work for an rto i found it difficult to seek feedback before submitting work like our trainees are able to do with our trainer assessors i feel if there was an option for seeking feedback or support prior to submitting work may lessen the amount of resubmits  i didn't like receiving resubmits and have it show on my transcript when i could have fixed the small mistake through trainer feedback
4,15-08-2020,review of cert iii business admin law,too many video recordings were requied for each unit and this became frustrating for the peer that was helping me do the videos as they didnt think there would be so many or they would have to have helped me with so manysome units seemed to ve a lot easier than others with variances in contentwould have loved to seen marking guidelines
4,13-08-2020,helpful supportive and overall great system,the teachers were very helpful and shared lots of valuable information when needed lots of support was provided which made the process easier and motivated me to continue at times it was hard to understand some assessments and things werent explained properly but the teachers would always take time to respond to any questions and help in the best way they could my course was also extended due to covid which was very helpful and i appreciated that a lot the layout of the course work is very nice and easy to go over i would recommend studying through open colleges if you prefer online study compared to a previous online course i did through a different organisation this was  better
5,12-08-2020,great online learning,most understanding of my situation when i was injured very supportive definitely suited for someone who can be disciplined to learn online would recommend to utilise the trainers to assist with your studies
4,11-08-2020,this is the second time i have studied,this is the second time i have studied with open colleges and i have been happy each time
1,07-08-2020,terrible experience,i have had so many problems with open colleges i also know  other people who have studied with them and not one has had a positive experience the course content changed during my study period i had completed six modules at that point and when the course changed i had to complete gap assessment for every single module i had already done some gap assessments were larger than the original assessment no extensions were automatically applied at this time you had to actually ask for it i got married during my course and stopped studying for six months they called me up and told me i could have deferred my course which was not an option explained to me before i started studying there were multiple times where i would call student support and was told different things by different people also my friends who were studying the same course as me got told different rules about applying for an extension compared to me there was zero consistency i have now been finished my course for six months now when i thought i had done everything i called student support twice and both times was told that id completed all my assignments and that i was just waiting for my assessors to mark them instead i got an email from my assessor saying id missed an assignment so i completed this again i called student support and they told me i should receive my graduation letter within a few days instead i got an email from my assessor saying that open colleges has lost one of my assignments and that i needed to resubmit it the email was confusing and mixed up assessment numbers from two different modules i replied back asking for clarification and have since been waiting for a month for a response i still have not finished my course but they are also not telling me what i need to do i would never recommend studying with open colleges the past three years have been tough to get this study done as open colleges did not make it easy and it has played a role in my mental health
5,07-08-2020,i am very grateful for rosan's support,i am very grateful for rosan's support in my course thank you for all your support and for sharing your knowledge with me
4,06-08-2020,the course itself was good but there,the course itself was good but there was one main assessor that i had troubles with also i was told that i could finish on time if i studied  hours a week which i found out was near impossible besides these hiccups i did enjoy the course
3,06-08-2020,excellent work for fiona,excellent work for fiona always give feedback on assessments very quickly very kind talking through the phone and giving clear instructions for the coursestudent support works very fast sometimes but very slowly most of the other times and workplace approval took very long time toothank you for the course
1,05-08-2020,one of the worst experiences i've ever had,one of the worst experiences i've ever had in my life avoid avoid avoid whoever wrote this course i  believe that their intention was for people to fall asleep andor quit the course absolutely terrible also their salesman essentially bullied me into signing up

5,03-08-2020,i would recommend open colleges,open colleges and the trainers are very helpful and the course and online format are easy to navigate and keep track ofthe trainers are very positive and offer lots of webinars to support the course loadi would recommend open colleges
3,02-08-2020,average business course,i enrolled into the diploma of business and it started out well then as the course progressed the assessment pieces got worse quizzes that were marked incorrect despite entering exactly what was in the course notes resulting in many emails to trainers and having to retake the quizzes multiple times assessments that were vague disjointed not well reviewed and in my opinion contained too many useless video submission tasks overall the trainers were helpful when they eventually got back to you and the course has topics that are semi interesting
4,01-08-2020,the faculty team were always so lovely,the faculty team were always so lovely and so so helpful i personally struggled with the course being online and not having that face to face support the resources were great but some of the work load was just too much especially module  and the portfolios compared to other courses peers have done or were doing
5,31-07-2020,thank you open colleges,i studied with open colleges to complete two courses i found the study material very interesting and easy to understand the topics were structured well as were the assessments i especially found access to my assessors prompt and extremely helpful they were there to support me and i can fault how fantastic they were  they encouraged me and helped me complete my courses thankyou so very much for assisting me in achieving my goals

1,19-09-2020,open colleges is trying to hide the truth from you,update hi sabrina thank you for your reply i have tried to resolve my issues with open colleges however they refused to call me back and told me via email they would stop responding to my emails open colleges refunded some of my money over  but still kept  from mejust a little update i have tried to write feedback on the open colleges facebook page and within  hours all my commentsfeedback where deleted and i was blocked by open colleges open colleges really does not care about their students most companies welcome the good and bad feedbackopen colleges does not and i wonder why they are trying so hard to hide how horrible they are please do not study with open colleges ever
4,22-07-2020,some modules have too many assessments,some modules have too many assessments and assessments were sometimes too long feedback from the assessors was quick overall i enjoyed the course
1,22-07-2020,was i scammed of my money to sign up,i was sold the dream product experience the cert  in disability which claimed to deliver a better experience than a university i can honestly say that i have been less than impressed from the moment i started the course and nothing of what i was sold came as part of the purchase but the exact opposite i believe that my money was taken and i was not delivered what i paid for which is incredibly disheartening and dissapointing anyone who has shown interest in doing their disability studies through open colleges i have warned and encouraged to find another provider the lack of communication from anyone in the teaching team no apparent course coordinator wait times of up to  months on assignments promises of credit transfers only to be told  months later that they decided against it content filled with spelling and gramatical errors and hyperlinks which no longer exist as well as the modules rehashing the same information in different ways has made for a really boring and frustrating experience my grievances have been brought up to the team via phone and chat throughout the time i have been a student and i have found out that i am not the only one who feels cheated of their money if you do decide to study with open colleges i hope your experience was better than mine and others and for those who have had a very positive experience i am very happy for you  thank you
5,21-07-2020,i have just finished my course and,i have just finished my course and highly recommend open college  for their support and education
5,21-07-2020,my experience with open colleges has,my experience with open colleges has been very educational the trainersassessors have got vast knowledge and experience in community services and are approachable i've just had the most friendly assessment session
1,28-07-2020,absolutely terrible experience,absolutely terrible experience would not recommend studying through open colleges various lecturers about  little support and no real education just a number
5,21-07-2020,quality content and online platform,content and online platform were fantastic assessor was knowledgeable in the field
3,20-07-2020,the assessors were great so patient so,the assessors were great so patient so understanding never frustrated but there were so many issues with each module even the assessors on most of the modules said there was an issue with their particular module i'd spend a wk  wks  wks a mth on a module frustrated that i wasn't understanding it found out from the assessor that the part of the module wasn't right after i put all that time and effort into the module
3,17-07-2020,average,modules and assessments poorly written course incomplete and being written while student were studying would only reccomend for short courses most trainers were helpful
5,17-07-2020,reading videos interactive games and more,the course is awesome apart from reading materials each module is filled with videos and interactive gamesthe course is somewhat easy and short yet it is still very useful and full of new knowledge
5,15-07-2020,open college were amazing throughout my,open college were amazing throughout my course even though it is online the staff were always there to support me there are webinars on all modules to help you along which were a really great guide for assessments there are guides for everything you may need studying referencing and the list goes on  i struggled to stay on track towards the end but the open college staff were there to encourage me to and i have now completed my course i want to say a big thanks to open college for all of their support a great and fulfilling experience
5,15-07-2020,highly recommend open colleges,open colleges has been great course easy to navigate and support whenever needed from training accessors truly was a positive experience

4,10-07-2020,it was a great time to learn online,it was a great time to learn online with open college i obtain useful information that helps me in my work all assessor are experienced people in the construction industrykind regardsnoushafarin
1,06-07-2020,certificate iv in building and construction,hiim providing my honest feedback about cert ivthe course material is generally poor and just been copied off either free websites or youtube videos which was good in some modules but the majority was badthe actual assessments were majorly poorly written and sometimes confusing such as the survey referring to point a or b as a benchmark where as the nomenclature has bm as benchmark which is a complete different rlthe course duration has expired because when i applied for a  week extension due to my wife being pregnant and needed to complete before the baby is born i was told that i cannot request extension without the baby birth certificate which defeats the purpose of my request and this was in november  after the baby was born in jan  i submitted the birth certificate only to be granted an extension as of november   which means that  months out of my six months extension are gonei had to beg and beg to have the extension till june which then i managed to complete the coursethis was the first and definitely the last time i will have anything to do with opencollegesthanksmoustafa
5,04-07-2020,what an amazing experience,what an amazing experience i have not studied in over  years and to be able to complete this course with the help of the amazing teachers was fantastic
4,02-07-2020,was great,was great  however would be nice to not deal with a bunch of different people most times when i called it would be different people with different information  otherwise great
1,01-07-2020,open colleges are terrible at,open colleges are terrible at communication which is extremely disappointing and frustrating when they are a distance education facility  also i was told and it is also written in the course summary that my course would require    hours study a week which is just ridiculous and totally unrealistic  it required at least twice that many hours  the course material is badly written there are broken links to videos and websites for extra reading
1,01-07-2020,no communication,no communication money hungry  did not start any units  when trying to contact them regarding cancel they did not reply and when they finally did they were vague and reported that  no one had contacted them  disgraceful and am taking this further as they do not deliver what they promise
5,30-06-2020,stars,stars excellent
3,30-06-2020,the course is well structured with,the course is well structured with great study resources and information but what i think personally i would have need more practical than theory more practical examples and and more webinars with maybe training or similar more collaboration between the trainer and the student on each module when you ask a question they are always very superficial i would have learn how to made tax return for a company and how to better analyze a financial statement rather than how to make a business plan it is unecessary for a bookkeeper or for a owner of a company or even for an accountant because there are company designated to do sobut overall the course was good
1,29-06-2020,it was a great start to the course,it was a great start to the course student support were very helpful however once the course was superseded it was like we didn't exist student support would take weeks sometimes to get back to you system errors happened frequently but  because they didn't effect all students they didn't bother to tell you only having one assessor by the end of it made completing the course in time impossible requiring you to fork out more money to finish the course what should have been a  year course ended up being a  year course because of their incompetence
3,29-06-2020,communication is poor between student,communication is poor between student support and lack of follow up  course content was repetitive between subjects and basic  the process of applying for rpl's is not only financially costly to apply is arduous and extremely timely consuming
1,29-06-2020,don't do it,i graduated at the start of the year they provided no help during hardship finally paid outstanding and yet no certificates were sent called and told to wait  days it's not good enough
3,28-06-2020,okay for self learning but they need to give more,studying with open college was good for the most part you can go at your own pace with no assessment due datessome assessors were better than others with response time and had clearer instructions if you had any questionsthe only problem is that there isnt much resources available for the modules they would benefit from doing webinars and youtube videos with examples of the assessment questions for those students that study better when you go through it once out of my  modules only  had any sort of video explanations or webinars and maybe another  had additional resourcesi also think the marking is a little pretentious and tedious they would withhold a mark for the smallest details that you then had to fix up and resubmit and wait a while  days to get one assessment finally marked i think they should just bring in pass or fail and not get too caught up in the details of assessment unless you were completely wrong i think they do this so their average goes up as id be withheld for not putting in formulas for my working out where no where in the assessment does it say to do that and then get a hd or a di think if youre okay with doing your own research and working through a booklet by yourself with minimal teachings open college is for you
5,28-06-2020,excellent course structure with,excellent course structure with valuable discussions regarding course content taking place some learning materials require updates
1,25-06-2020,terrible excuse of a company,absolutely deplorable service all they care about is your money and not providing any service what so ever as well as terrible customer service would not go near them with a  foot pole stay away from this pathetic company they are just hear to get your money and thats itplease stay away i cannot stress this enough this will company will do whatever they can to take your money changing prices weekly trying to deduct money from your account even when going through an appeal process
5,24-06-2020,opencollege was great,opencollege was great supportive during my hard times and assisted me when i needed helpcourse work was easy to navigate and straightforward  i really enjoyed studying with opencollege and will definitely be back to do more study easy continent and catered to work best for the student thanks for everything opencollege
5,24-06-2020,it was nice and smooth experience and i,it was nice and smooth experience and i must appreciate the support provided by my trainer kim kimberly it was an outstanding experience  course material was good enough to get good understanding of the subjects and assessments were very realistic thank you
5,23-06-2020,i have experience while i'm study with,i have experience while i'm study with open colleges refresh my skill and all teachers are very helpful and help me to get trough every question i need i will recommend the open colleges for my friends
4,23-06-2020,flexible study,i found open colleges to be a perfect fit for my busy life style  being online meant l could study anywhere l went
5,23-06-2020,the open college review,the open college student site was very user friendly i liked the way the modules were set up it was very easy to keep track of all my subjectsit would of been a bonus if i could of made notes next to each paragraph or somehow bookmark pages so i could refer back at any time without having to read through againthe assessors were very knowledgeable and encouragingstudent support were very helpful i was able to get through to them very fast and they were able to answer all my questions straight awayi recommend this horticulture cert to anyone working within the industry it definitely made the video presentations a lot easier having a worksite and the workmates available to help and support it would of been challenging otherwise
1,23-06-2020,worst learning experience of my life,this has been by far the most unprofessional learning experience i had ever had student support staff are friendly but have little idea on how to assist our issues and trainersassessors are impossible to contact i should have finished this course months ago but my assessor takes weeks sometimes months to mark assignments and has missed several phone interviews would not recommend to anyone ever
1,22-06-2020,never in my life would i recommend open,never in my life would i recommend open colleges my experience has been extremely disappointing and has taken twice as long as expected due to lack of available assessors and complete lack of communication over two months to get assessments back then constant lodging of complaints to get extensions due to their issues do not waste your time or your money
1,18-06-2020,poor content of lessons dishonest and appalling customer service,i was looking for a refresher course in a subject i use to work in  years ago i find their lessons to be extremely basic and boring on the back of what they teach i would not hire someone telling me heshe has a certificate from open college as heshe would be incompetent they are also very dishonest in the way theyll sign you up not honouring discounts they told you theyd give you their customer service is appalling as they do everything by emails too gutless to phone and talk in person avoid at all cost
5,18-06-2020,i loved my study with open colleges,i loved my study with open colleges the course was engaging informative and relative to what i wanted to study and the staff were super accommodating and helpful will definitely recommend studying with open colleges
5,17-06-2020,very structured easy to follow with great support,very structured easy to follow great support very accommodating and helpful staff it was simple to follow the modules one thing that could be improved to see more clearly which modules and which task you have already completed i really enjoyed that i could study when i choose to the feedback and grading was fast and i have received great support highly recommend open colleges
4,17-06-2020,open colleges review,it was a great experience to go through open colleges obviously there are always ups and downs when it comes to studying online just a few of the negatives were some assessorstrainers took a long time to get back to an email which can make it hard to continue on they should not be marking on their personal preference which i had a few people do and that was disappointing it should not be about what they like and dislike it should be about my design and the areas i have done well and need to improve this can be quiet upsetting for some people some modules need to be updated as at times when i got marked they were telling me to add this and this but it never said anywhere to do that in the assignment i also found that there was so much reading in the modules and i got lost at times but some parts were great to read a lot was repeatedon a positive note some assessorstrainers were amazing and got back to me within the day or even a few hours which was amazing some were really helpful and did not mind how many questions i asked which is good as i ask a lot of questions i liked not having specific deadlines for assignments as life does get busy so somedays were good to study and some weren't whenever i called the study helpline or whoever for help i had nothing but great people and they were so helpful every time and i was so thankful for that overall it was a great time and i have throughout my study recommended at least  people to study through open colleges and i will continue to do so thank you so much for all the support that i got along the way
1,16-06-2020,dont do it,open colleges is a money hungry inconsiderate company they wouldnt let me pull out of my course when though i completed one assignment and was only one day over my cancel course date i have literally only just been able to pay off the course over a few years and i had to borrow the money to do so please do me a favour and dont sign up because if youre like me and suffer mental health they wont give a crap about you and your needs and drain you of your money
5,12-06-2020,very well put together content and,very well put together content and assessmentsa joy to navigate
2,11-06-2020,cert iv in information technology,although the course is relatively cheap in comparison to other institutions the course material contains links to youtube videos that don't exist anymore countless spelling errors and the assessments seem tedious and irrelevant to the subject area with that said however i would like to thank damian for his continued support throughout my studies and valuable feedback on my assessments
5,11-06-2020,loved every moment,i can thoroughly recommend open colleges to anyonei really enjoyed my  months of in class learnings  and the educators we absolutely amazingi made loads of friends i will have for life and gained hands on experience throughout my nursing placements and lab worksthe support and materials you receive helped me gain confidence to do this job ive always wanted to do
4,11-06-2020,certificate iii in ecec complete yay,i found this certificate iii in early childhood education and care very comprehensive it was challenging at times but there was always someone who could help out module  was a course all of its own and i found this to be the most challenging the work placement was enjoyable and an excellent practical application of skills being acquiredi would not hesitate to recommend open colleges to others wishing to study from home
1,10-06-2020,regrettable decision to study through oc,terrible service and communicationextremely long delays and highly unprofessional
5,08-06-2020,open colleges makes things comfortable,open colleges have been really supportive toward me during my cert iv human resources the support centre is absolutely fantastic always available trainers are informative and concise there was compassion involved when granting my extensions much appreciated open colleges made studying fun and comfortable
4,08-06-2020,wonderful team of people very helpful,wonderful team of people very helpful and supportive throughout my course
2,04-06-2020,not for hands on and practical learners,if you are a practical hands on learner then i wouldn't suggest open colleges it is all online and you really need to have motivation yourself to complete the course when you reach out to tutors it would take them a few days to respond  which doesn't help when you are trying to get help with an assignment also reaching out to other students and 'study buddies' no one would ever reply or there isn't a common group to reach out to to get help it was very hard to complete this course without much support im glad i'm done and its over i believe it would be good if the course had live tutor lessons or lessons teaching you certain things
3,04-06-2020,diploma of graphic design,i liked the course load and the assessments were beneficial also it was easy to access on an ipad or a desktop which is also handy that being said i have a few issues listed belowunlocking modules  when i started the course only two modules were available with more being unlocked when an assessment is markedcompleted this is fine  in that it forces you to go through the modules in a linear fashion  but if you are waiting for an assignment to be marked you're left twiddling your thumbs and you ultimately lose time i understand the assessors have a lot to do so i don't think any whips need to be cracked the easiest solution would be for all modules to be unlocked with the exception of the assessments which is essentially what ended up happening once i phoned for assistanceupdating content  the modules had a lot of relevant information that if found beneficial to the learning process but a lot needed to be updated to stay relevant i understand graphic design moves pretty quickly but some of the content was almost superfluous case in point would be the module on ui the software recommended was pencil project which i don't think is even relevant from an industry standpoint i understand its free but so is figma and xd both of which are used widely in the industryreviewing assessments  i found that there was a lot of ambiguity in the language for the assessments in that i would often have to sift through the comments on the assessment page to see if another student had addressed the same problem i was having another issue i had was with the level of work that focused on safe work practices obviously it's important but i don't think it warranted the amount of attention allotted i would rather see more coursework on the process of creatingif i could give the course a  i would because a  seems too harsh and i know i wasn't the best student it just feels like it has the potential to be a lot better it just needs a bit of a spring clean
5,03-06-2020,friendly staff who are willing to help,friendly staff who are willing to help  queries are answered professionally and timeously
5,02-06-2020,great online learning environment,i did the professional communications short course i found that the course structure was well laid out and made it easy to follow the modules the course content itself was helpful and there were videos and interactive quizzes that made it more interesting than just reading an info dump of facts
3,02-06-2020,my overall experience was pretty average,my overall experience was pretty average when i was thinking about enrolling with open colleges i was getting a number of calls with promises of support throughout my whole enrollment i did not receive a support phone call checking in on my progress or if i needed extra support which i really would have benefited from as i found the independent learning and self motivation hardwhen i had to speak to support via phone for the most part they were pleasant and helpful however in my last month of being with open colleges i spoke with a consultant debra and she was rather unhelpful rude and very abrupt i requested to speak to a manager or faculty representative to discuss my individual concerns this was denied and i was told there is nothing that a faculty member can help you with that i can't i needed to do the following up and did not receive a phone call from debra with my issue this as a result left me with  week to complete my work placement paperwork and log books which was really unreasonable when working fulltime i did not receive a call to say that my extension had been deniedi can't fault rychelle carmody  she was great throughout the process and had initiative to get in contact with me to discuss work placement she applied for me to have a one month extension that was funnily approved  week after debra told me it was deniedassessment feedback was always clear however sometimes it did take a while to get a response sometimes you had to wait past the  day timeframe they gave you it was difficult to get support on an assessment question quicklycourse content is outdated if i did not get the opportunity to work and study in the field i would have struggled to complete the assessments with the limited course content i had i completed a number of my assessments based on hands on experience and guidance from mentorsoverall i would not recommend the course to anyone who is looking to study online the course has been lengthy and the whole process was terrible it added extra stress on top of an already stressful sector to work ini am disappointed that the most i heard from open colleges in nearly  years is when i was getting empty promises of support the price of the diploma is not worth it  for a piece of paper that i obtained purely through good mentoring of supervisors and not through the support or education from open colleges
1,01-06-2020,took to long to get back to you about,took to long to get back to you about something or didnt back to you at alldidnt get much contacted by staff to see how you were going eg emails or phone i could say a lot more but i wont because the staff know about it
5,30-05-2020,my experience with open colleges wasrewarding,my experience with open colleges was very rewarding i could follow the assessments and webinars quite clearly and understood the tasks we needed to accomplish i had an amazing assessor who helped me with time management and meeting my targets of finishing each study period its up to the individual person with making sure you reach your set goals with finishing each study period and managing your time im very happy and graduated
2,29-05-2020,an ordeal i would not care to repeat,my assessor was as helpful as she could be but i felt like every time i needed support from the college themselves they dragged their feet particularly with workplace learning the college promised support in finding a host as a selling point to get my money yet this was not available without first jumping through several hoops after i had trouble finding a host on my own i jumped through all their hoops and still never actually received the support they had promised all up i spent  months looking to secure myself a host with zero assistance from the college and at additional cost to myself in paying for an extension to provide myself with reasonable time to get my placement completed and being told i needed to pay for a police check to satisfy the college's procedures before they could help they still never contacted me with assistance this was at least  months of course time completely wasted as by that time i had finished the rest of my course work the experience of dealing with the college was incredibly stressful and soured the whole course experience for me i would not put myself through open colleges again or recommend it to any person who asks
3,29-05-2020,course material needs improvement,course material needs improvement multiple broken links duplication of content across modules sufficient variety in type of material heavy reliance on internet links compared to delivered material some modules not as in depth as expected web modules very hard to follow ok support from assessor but limited feedback on how to improve nil feedback on activities student forum some posts limited interaction dekay in assessment marking greater than  days delay month to recieve qualifucation due quiz admin error not picked up by open colleges but client

5,27-05-2020,i had an amazing teacher,i had an amazing teacher she helped me every step of the way but some of the work was a confusing
3,27-05-2020,mediocre,i found open colleges fine if you are okay working with little help some assignments were not clear enough and getting in contact can take forever you can end up waiting a long time to receive assignments back just to be asked to review an answer that was honestly not missing anything there are some lovely trainers but unfortunately not all are up to par
4,26-05-2020,good experience overall,good experience overall plenty of help and assistance from student support portal

2,21-05-2020,waiting times on marking asessments,the cert  was good for information although that is as far as it goes the marking times and the time that it had taken for questions to be answered was not expectablelast note is that people are wanting to get their studies finalised so that they can proceed onto their futures this is a big factor in online studypeople are relying on prompt marking and message answering of questionsmy trainer nicole manning she was very understanding and helpful very nice personwhen all of these problems are rectified the course will be a pleasure to studythank you open college's
5,21-05-2020,cert  iv building,really easy to navigate your way thruwhen asking questions response was goodthank you
1,21-05-2020,absolutely hopeless,absolutely hopeless they took so long to reply to questions and mark assessments stopping me from moving on as you cant start the next assessment until you have passed the last i had to continuously ask for extensions because they took so long to reply this made my course take  months to complete where at other places it can take weeks the assessment questions were often not clear in what it was actually asking you to do the reading material often had spelling and grammar mistakes or just didnt make sense and links attachments put into the modules often didnt work i also have friends who have studied with them that have also had a bad experience wouldnt even consider studying through them again
5,21-05-2020,diploma in community services,it has been an absolute pleasure to learn from the open colleges assessors i have found rosan particularly very educational to learn from rosan very supportive and delivered great content during my learning experience i have found the open space platform to be easy to navigate with handy tools the price for the course was very reasonable for what i recieved and am please to have walked away with career enhancements instantly thank you open colleges i am already looking at my next course options
1,21-05-2020,reporting to consumer affairs,currently reporting open colleges to consumer affairs i signed up for a course earlier this year and was offered a half price deal if i paid within an allocated amount of days when i called up to pay about two days out of the allocated agreement time the deal was off and they now required the amount paid in full i told the guy over the phone tom o'brian i'm pretty sure his name was that there was no way i could afford that amount and asked if i could pay the original amount agreed upon from there tom's friendly attitude turned completely inappropriate and almost threatening i had emails from him at weird times of the night asking for payment this put an extreme amount of stress on me as i also have a disability which i explained to them at the start and put in my documentation they asked me to fill out a 'special consideration' form as i wanted out of the service so i submitted all details required including my disability pension health card card it got rejected because they required further evidencewhat more evidence does a person with a disability need to give i now have debt collectors emailing and calling me at all times of the day asking for amounts of up to  mind you i never once logged into the course or started any material i opted out within the first couple of weeks but because it wasn't in the  day cooling off period it didn't apply be careful i have read other peoples stories of them calling to opt out within the  day period only to cancel over the phone only to be told they need everything in writing or they will not approve the decision it is all a scam and an absolute trap whatever you do to try and get out of this service it is a dead end i have no choice but to take the matter further
5,21-05-2020,i would recommend open colleges,i would recommend open colleges as a great option for studying the platform is relatively clear well presented and logical i found the course material to be relevant interesting and engaging i found the lecturers and support staff were always friendly encouraging and ready to help i have always worked better under pressure to a deadline so the policy of an 'extra'  months helped motivate me to finish it offif you are willing to put the work in read instructions offer a little patience in the processes of lecturers getting back to you they always got back to me well within timeframes and accept responsibility for yourself then open colleges might be a great option for you
1,19-05-2020,project management,course studied  project managementa few points from my experience pre signing to the course i was sold the experience of not being left alone during studies and being taken through an orientation upon starting to guide me through setting up study buddies etc which is one of the reasons i chose open colleges over other providers this did not happen i was not contacted once during the entire course unless i messaged my assessor i was also told i can extend the course for as long as needed but would have to pay an administration fee which i didn't have an issue with also this was not the case when i applied for an extension i was told i had to send a request for approval to be reviewed i was also told each module within the course would have an online webinar to go over the learning outcomes of the module go through what is required for each assessment and answer any questions students may have this happened for the first module of the course and was very helpful however this did not happen again once again sold a lie the content within each module i found quite good and relevant for the education i was after one area that i feel needs work is the constant role plays these are hard to organise if you are studying on your own which i believe most would be considering this is an online at your own pace service  and don't have anyone to do these with this delays getting assessments in and considering you are left on your own without being directed to the study buddy service etc i found ridiculous i will finish by saying the assessor i had was fantastic and very helpful when contacted i do feel they don't have the time to give the service open colleges promises
1,19-05-2020,absolutely disgusting,absolutely disgusting they steal you money deliver a product that doesnt work and then refuse refundsi have supplied all documents required and they have kept my  after promising to refund itthey never marked a single assignment the course was never startedi just want my money back

5,07-05-2020,good course,good course comprehensive and practical friendly staff assessor and faculty enjoyed
1,07-05-2020,don't waste your money with this college,i study aged care with open they requested a lot of video assessments that require you to ask a friend or family member to help with acting and it is extremely difficult because you don't always have people around to help with acting they also require bed making video assessment that your bed and linens at home are not suitable i asked my friends who study with other institutes and they said they didn't have to do video assessment to complete the certtheir student support is really like a joke they don't really helpful at all and they didn't explain about these assessments when you ask and study with them it is too late to defer and get full refund until you realize this
5,07-05-2020,i loved studying with open colleges,i loved studying with open colleges i never had any problems and they were always so helpful with everything would highly recommend
3,06-05-2020,stars,i gave  stars due to the timing of assessments being marked i was told at the beginning that assessments will be marked within  business days towards the end of the course it was taking  weeks sometimes and i had to call customer support about it i even had to ask for an extension that cost me  just to give them time to mark assessment then i had to call regarding my last assessment which had not been marked i received another extension  free this time thank god i was not happy about this as i had completed the assessments within the course time frame
4,06-05-2020,very helpful,marking was very strict failed on minor errors  sometimes minor spelling errors could there be room for this to avoid extra work resubmitting re marking  waiting for results time could be better spent by assessors   students to move onotherwise everyone was very helpful  always responded quickly to questions  were very thorough enjoyed the course a lot thank you for the opportunity
2,05-05-2020,course work vague trainers unhelpful,the course work was very vague and the trainers could have done a lot more to help out the assessments often required work that wasn't covered in the course work and the assessments were extremely vague in what they were actually asking the trainers would often give feedback explaining what was actually required which is what should have been there from the very start i wouldn't recommend open colleges i would  go through an actual tafe next time
1,05-05-2020,do not study through open colleges,if it were possible to give open colleges less than one star i would if you are considering studying online i highly recommend finding an alternate provider to open collegestheir student support system is the biggest joke i have ever encountered do not expect to get a response from their team regarding any issue in less than  days i have waited  months to gain a response to a complaint i made with them and to even gain this response required me calling and hammering them with emails to process my complaint then after finally getting a response they acknowledged that they were in part in the wrong but could offer no solution and nothing would in fact be resolvedthey want your money and thats it once theyve sucked you in good luck getting help with anything
5,04-05-2020,couldnt recommend open colleges enough,i have completed my certificate  in health services assisting and my diploma of human resources management with open colleges both times they have been absolutely amazing and helpful with my diploma i was pregnant and needed many extensions the course was only  months and i did the course in  and they let me do it to help me out the assessors are all lovely and listened to everything i had asked of them and they helped me im grateful for everything open colleges has given me in terms of my education and helping me improve my self confidence through learning
4,02-05-2020,assessment marking slow,assessment marking slowonly complaint is the time to return assessments  this was not the case when i started this course  generally overall good experience  special mention to ruchi who was always helpful and prompt to respond to questions etc
5,30-04-2020,great college i had no problems,great college i had no problems studied cert  in dental assisting  if you can be self motivated and organised dont do an online course thanks for everything again
1,29-04-2020,worst college ever  do not use open colleges,my experience with open colleges has been terrible and i'm going to take them to court do not go with them they're just after your money they work on kpi's once they have your money they do not care about you and you have no hope in getting it back they will do everything in their power to not refund youthey were very pushy and got me to enrol even though i told them i had commitments i was going away and visiting my family i told them this and i wouldn't be able to start the course until after i got back so it was after the cooling off periodwhen i looked over the course there was soo many spelling and punctuation errors as well as broken links and outdated course material due to severe health issues i wasn't even able to start the course so i applied for special consideration and i wasn't given a full refund the special consideration is an absolute lie they're keeping over  of my partners money for no good reason the cancellation fee is only  what is the other  for i didn't need materials i didn't even start the course only looked over it they are so rude and ignore all your emails also they're no longer a member of the resolution institute mediation scheme and when they do reply they keep saying to appeal through them for an external investigation even though they're no longer members so that's a joke i was also given false information by them what ever you do stay a long way away from this company and go through tafe
5,29-04-2020,certificate iv in bookkeeping and accounting,this was my first time pursuing an online course so i was unsure what to expect i chose open colleges for the certificate iv in bookkeeping and accounting as it was the best way to gain the appropriate qualifications to register as a bas agent i was challenged with the course as i had hoped to be and the trainers and assessors were always a quick email away to answer any questions with very helpful advise whenever i got stuck student support were always amazing and made life so much easier i recommend open colleges to anyone who is motivated and looking for a great balance of workstudylife
2,29-04-2020,not that impressed,the enrolment process was a nightmare  turns out the guy who initially took my enquiry left and didn't tell anyone  there are so much spelling punctuation and grammar error within the courseware  communication with trainer was very poor  it wasn't until the last module of the course till i finally received emails to my replies
3,28-04-2020,i found the additional notes to support,i found the additional notes to support the assesments informative and very detailed the first  modules were fine however module  had very outdated information i believe this his requires updating
5,28-04-2020,great,great thanks for all your hard work
4,28-04-2020,helpful support team and trainers  assessors,i have had nothing but positive support from all the trainers and assesors in particular claire lyndal charmaine eliana and georgina they have been able to answer my queries very promptly and always provide valuable feedback on my assessments when i was stuck they were always a quick email  chat away to help me with my queriesmy only issue was with the very indept tasks at a cert iii level for work placement i found that  hours was not enough to complete all the tasks and try to gain industry experience in the role not to mention added pressure of having to complete  other modules during the placement apart from this everything else was perfect and would definitely recommend open colleges for anyone looking to get their cert iii in early childhood education and care thank you team
4,28-04-2020,great experience,great experience i just wish that the course would be marked faster and that it was easier to communicate
1,27-04-2020,im giving one star because  stars is,im giving one star because  stars is not an option many many errors in the course material tutors try but they dont write this stuff lack of support in particular admin procedures and one very rude training and operations manager i have lodged a complaint with the australian skills quality provider
5,26-04-2020,i highly recommend open colleges,i highly recommend open colleges the support they provide is excellent enrollment was easy dedicated educator guides you through out the course when needed detailed material is provided for the course recon one software is very informative and easy to use for assessments just in case you cannot complete the course in time due to various reasons open colleges give you an option to extend which gives peace of mind thanks to open colleges for adding more to my knowledge
1,24-04-2020,do not use open colleges,my experience with open colleges has been terrible and i would not recommend them to anyone they lost assignments i had completed which caused months of grief trying to fix and delayed my completion the communication between student support and the lecturers is poor i was told on several occasions conflicting instructions my overall experience with open colleges was extremely poor
5,24-04-2020,i had a really great experience,i had a really great experience with open colleges i had assessors that were really wonderful and answered any and all the questions that i had throughout my course and helped me even when there was no appointments available very happy with my course experience
1,23-04-2020,steer clear if studying cert iv in bookkeeping,if you are interested in doing a cert iv in bookkeepping i would not recommend this rto at all i was advised incorrectly of their rpl process and i was completely misled there are other rto's that i have spoken to that have an rpl process that is actually achievable my course trainer only spoke in circles with no real to help the course itself is so outdated with the information they teach businesses have not operated this way for years this course will not actually equip you with the skills to be a bookkeeper without strict supervision from an experienced bookkeeperaccountant i feel i have wasted  on a course that i will not be able to finish even though i have  years experience in the field that i am studying
5,23-04-2020,i loved this course so much and learnt,i loved this course so much and learnt alot thankyou for everything
1,22-04-2020,the biggest mistake you can make,this is one of the biggest mistakes you can make is to enrol with open colleges for the dual diploma in marketing social media course it's not only badly structured learning on the online platform with little to no learning support they have a student facebook group and that's what is what will be your main learning support is other students who are doing the course doubling up as peer tutors but their student advisors have no educational teaching or teaching support staff experience they are sales people therefore theyre agenda ive unfortunately learnt is focused on signing you up and paying for the course when problems pop up unexpectedly due to hardship they will not help you even when circumstantial evidence  is provided by higher authority they will ignore it and keep saying its insufficient even though it was them that requested such thingstheyre financial focused and do not care about the wellbeing or feedback of their students they offer no real help when special circumstances are brought up from my experience they use delaying and confusing tactics give vague instructions they will not tell you what you need to do as a student for your case until it's too latedon't bother with open colleges find a better more reputable college like tafe or private college who are willing to speak about the actual course with the actual teachers department teaching the course and deal with them directly not like open colleges who are just sales people worried about their kpis and bonusesthese courses by open colleges are moneygrabbing corporate driven schemes to attract people at their most vulnerable they speak to you in an understanding empathetic way but its all fake they do this just to sign you upthey play on the emotions of the most trusting and desperate i had to learn the awfully hard way and lost thousands of dollars along with a lot of sleep and loss of self worth it took a while to actually tap in my naive mind that these people actually didnt care about my education for a long time i became too afraid to constantly try and push for fair guidance outcomes i got neither when i did try it just made me more depressed and anxious each time i approached them for help constantly dealing with different staff but each time like they fed me the same lines and tried to make me believe they went above and beyond when in truth it didnt matter to them at all they already predetermined the resolution before the advisor knew the details of the personal circumstances or before you reply to the question i was constantly ask what do i want for my learning course outcomeapplications for extensions and or special circumstancesi reiterate they will do anything to get you to sign up and will do anything to retain your money regardless of the questionable ethical standards save your money and a lot of disappointment and dont get suckered in by their sales team what sounds too good to be true is in this case
5,22-04-2020,best choice,i have found open colleges to be the best choice as i work full time and they are so  flexiblethis allows me to study and  complete assessments in my own time without due datesopen colleges staff are very helpful and friendly people
2,22-04-2020,certificate iv in accounting and bookkeeping,unfortunately this course has been a complete waste of my time and money the support was lacking in that it took a long time for questions to be answered along the way sometimes and because of a change to the course started out with learning myob and then the course changed to reckon which businesses dont use finding employment is now difficult because i dont have experience in myob or xero which is what employers are looking for meaning i now need to further study very disapponted
5,20-04-2020,cert iv business admin,i thoroughly enjoyed doing this course would definitely recommend it and if possible i will continue onto something else
1,19-04-2020,what a disappointment,really unqualified out of touch tutors that have zero real work experience that deliberately failed students to avoid them moving forward the diploma set up is also questionable not sure if it is with open colleges or with tafe online just go with tafe online directly once you paid in full other departments apart from sales are very rude and hard to deal with
5,15-04-2020,excellent building and construction,excellent building and construction coursewould highly recommend this coursethank you very much to the open college team
4,15-04-2020,cert iv programming,overall the structure of the course was well thought out and provided a good process to learn the materials and gather an understanding of the programming process there were some items which could have been introduced a little earlier or even delayedin general the course achieved its goals of providing an education in programming at a reasonably challenging level
5,15-04-2020,i found the course very good on,i found the course very good on learning content and i enjoyed the experience i have graduated with a cert  in disability and i am thrilled
1,15-04-2020,has been taking money and not providing content for  months,open colleges are taking money and not providing any services do not reccomend my mum has been putting herself through an aged care course and has spent the last  months paying the monthly fees and waiting for the next assignment to be released  months of paying with no coursework to do she tried to email multiple people multiple times and the only reply didn't even adress the issue now she's facing an additional fee as she didn't complete the course in time she's here she's ready to learn it's hard enough mentally and financially for a single mother to take this mission on the least you could do is provide the service you're charging people for
5,14-04-2020,excellent education,i spent my time in best place the college has got excellent resourcedeepa balakrisna
4,14-04-2020,first timer,for my first online course i am proud to have achieved the end result of completing cert  in dental assisting it took a little while with quite a few extensions but open colleges were amazing in their understanding of my needs and my assessor fiona was a massive support in getting me through to the very end i am forever grateful student support was very supportive every time i needed help and i would recommend it to anyone

2,13-04-2020,go through tafe,i wouldnt recommend do yourself a favour and go through tafe the lack of response from some of the online trainers and assessors was a joke one assessment i submitted got told to resubmit  i changed a couple of words and then got a credit waste of time trainers are barely qualified most had below the diploma i was attaining and a certificate  workplace assessment and training insulting reallystudent services were a joke the number of times i emailed and asked for something and they never replied trainers sometimes never replied so difficult to get anyone to actually call you to talk through your questions never again

4,10-04-2020,this mum graduated what an achievement,what an experience this journey was and to have graduated is an amazing feeling and achievement being a fulltime mum and working time management was the key but towards the end it became easier as you settle into the course and find your way around the sites programs and stop making more work for yourself being remote meant we had times of technological issues which really made it hard but over all i am happy with my choice and would do it all over again i know my course will get used i loved my placement and work has been offered to me i feel very proud of myself and recommend any one to get a course behind them especially mum's like me getting back into work after children and looking at a new direction we all deserve and can accomplish  anything we put our mind to happy studying

5,06-04-2020,after not studying for  years,after not studying for  years i did not think that online study would be for me how wrong was i i was worried that i would not be supported if i found my studies to be too challengingthe assessorstrainers were very encouraging  usually replied to any course related queries within  hours it also challenged me to problemsolve myself before going to the trainers for assistance most of the time i was able to work things out for myself or look things up in googlethe course material was very thoroughi would highly recommend open colleges if you're thinking of doing online study
4,04-04-2020,i enjoyed the course but found a lot of,i enjoyed the course but found a lot of the module assignments were repetitive i also found it took a long time for modules to be graded i also found the video assessments a nightmare when it came to uploading them i had thought i had finished the course back in december but some modules werent signed off and i couldnt get the videos to download assessments i thought had gone through hadnt but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and i have finally graduated  mths later
5,03-04-2020,open colleges has been a great,open colleges has been a great experience for me help was always provided when needed i especially appreciated all the help from claire cooper who helped me through the entirety of my work placement and gave me great help and feedback i would definitely recommend open colleges to others and i will be doing my diploma through them soon
5,02-04-2020,really enjoyed the course,really enjoyed the course  found the trainers and assessors really responsive with great feedback  would definitely recommend open colleges
3,02-04-2020,open colleges experience,enrolling in open colleges was easyassignments were graded promptlycourse material was well laid out sometimes repetitivedisappointed in lack of assistance when trying to find a placement in a rural area be sure to have a placement and know if you can get one before you pay for the coursei prefer university learning i found tafe very over the top in regards to assignments and if you miss one aspect the entire assignment was often wrong and you would have to resubmit where at university you would get a grade  but this is not open colleges fault but something to consider
1,02-04-2020,terrible experience do not enroll,terrible experience me and my peers all hate this place would never recommend to anyone id actually go out of my way to save them from enrolling into this terrible course content i dont know what the other subjects are like the the diploma of social media marketing is horrible
5,01-04-2020,enrolled nurse,was an amazing experience the staff were so supportive
1,01-04-2020,having to take open colleges to a civil,having to take open colleges to a civil court is the most irritating and frustrating experience their website is misleading and their student resolution team only have no in their vocabulary i strongly urge others who are having issues to seek legal action do not waste time with tribunals they get no where i cannot understand how this company still is allowed to run as a registered rto if the student resolution team asks you to contact them on here i wouldn't bother either you will get no where take it to a formal court room
2,31-03-2020,i personally found that the assessments,i personally found that the assessments were poorly written there was a lack of support and that the services provided such as talking to an online agent were frequently unavailable the assessments had spelling and grammatical errors sometimes to the point that the question didn't make sense considering i was completing a course in speech assistance this was extremely disappointing whenever support was needed it would take days to get a reply i often found there was no assistance from staff members over the phone due to a lack of knowledge even when regarding my account details rather than the course itself also the chat online services were never available even through the opening hours overall i'm really upset that i spent thousands of dollars for a piece of paper with information i could have learned on the internet
1,31-03-2020,terrible,terrible assessments have taken a month  to be assessed when you contact support they say there's a backlog we're having issues etc i was told i could rpl parts of my course before i purchased it and now half way through i am told it is not possible i have submitted assessments and they have been lost i would not recommend open colleges i would never use them again stick with tafe
1,30-03-2020,not recommended  poor support inconsistent,i would not recommend studying with this organisation student support is virtually nonexistent the course i completed required placement and it took me over a year to secure somewhere to do this i asked for help from oc as was one of the attractive features of the course and it resulted in nothing ultimately i just had to keep applying on my own until i found a place which had availability to allow me to complete placement because of this delay i was then told that i would not be able to complete my course as no more extensions would be provided and so i would receive a statement of attainment for what i had completed to date this isn't entirely ocs issue i had some health problems which made completion of placement impossible for around  months i take ownership of that as something which is totally on mecourse materials were often outdated and assessment material was poorly written or worded making it difficult to determine exactly what the assessors were looking for you to demonstrate turnaround time on assessments and exams also left a lot to be desired it would often take several weeks for results to be returned this also meant you often got stuck waiting for your next module to be releasedfeedback from assessors was also incredibly inconsistent i was told on one exam that i was providing too much information and then marked down on the next one for not providing enough detail this happened repeatedly and when i asked about why the feedback on my exams was so vastly different in terms of what was actually required i didn't get a responseit was a really disappointing experience all round it honestly just feels like as soon as they take your money you don't matter in the slightest
5,30-03-2020,i am based in perth,i am based in perth western australia i found the educators to be very thorough and supportive and the facility and labs modern and uptodate the placements were excellent at well known large public hospitals and the skills taught in class and on lab days were relevant to current practice i've heard mixed messages about other diploma of nursing colleges and tafe's and i am happy i chose open colleges school of health for my diploma in nursing enrolled nurse i highly recommend the perth based campus katie

5,27-03-2020,i have done many courses over the,i have done many courses over the years and as i work remotely most of these courses are via distance educationi have been very disappointed in the past at various providers for their poor teaching material customer service or  course structure and felt that none of these courses prepared me to be confident to put my learning into practicethe opencolleges automotive course really impressed me the textbook was very useful and the online material was pitched to the correct level and the diagrams very helpful the information was easy to read and follow and the additional resources quite useful  i found the videos very helpful i would love to see even more of them and the background music was very catchythe staff were amazing lucas bendt really assisted me as i was having trouble uploading the videos on the opencolleges assessment page and very quickly downloaded my videos via the wetransfer appmichael gave useful feedback was quick to mark assignments and even personally contacted me to check on my progesss and offer support with the workplace projectsthe only negative experience i had was while trying to upload videos i dont have very good internet reception so when it cuts out the videos that are in the process of uploading dont get saved as i go until i press submit and therefore i have to begin the uploading process all over again and a lot of videos would not upload due to file size or format despite me making the videos as short and low resolution as i couldbut the staff were very accommodating in letting me send my files via another method so only a small issue really thanks opencolleges
4,26-03-2020,highly recommend,great support definitely start looking for placement early overall would recommend to get qualifications
2,26-03-2020,lack of support from teachers,lack of support from teachers lack of reply from emails on hold most of the time on the phone for over minutes everything you call

2,26-03-2020,this was very disappointing considering,this was very disappointing considering the cost of the course lack of help from assessors quizzes not working assessment questions written badly and didn't make sense to the scenarios given response times to any help needed was poor i have worked in the industry for  years with the most severe of people both in behaviours and physical ability and this was not covered well at all there are many variation to participants and this for someone who has no experience was not covered well at allunfortunately very disappointed in my experience especially with the amount it cost as wellthe online experience needs to be better and any problems with things like quizzes not working properly needs to be corrected to help new studentsit is not a good course for anyone with no experience in the industry

3,23-03-2020,stars,student support was very slow to respond and a lot of links to learning resources where out of date assessors were fair and supportive overall it was a good experience

4,18-03-2020,online study review,the course content and delivery method and application was of a very high standard  it was a good blend of experiential video and theoretical blendthere was a frustration and delay of getting assessment marked due to changes within administrative proceduresthere was only one day of face to face intensive day this could be increased as i found group study to be beneficial more observations reflection  etcwork placement was difficult to obtain
5,17-03-2020,fantastic course,fantastic course the course structure was extremely organised and the information was in depth to ensure that the assessments are able to be done with a high standard additionally the tutor support is very good and responses will be relevant and quick
4,17-03-2020,certificate iv accounting and bookkeeping,the trainers assessors and support staff are great  very encouraging and helpful the course was interesting and the assessment tasks were relevant to real life work scenarios i found that some of the course material needs a good edit due to errors or typos also i was told some of my answers in an assessment task were too long so perhaps there should be a suggested word count or specify how many points to list etc
3,17-03-2020,review,corse material is good for certificate ii in animal studies however assessors take a while to mark and grade your assessments and there is little to no support from them the open colleges student support is not good at all they take a long while to reply and when they do they are often not very helpful
5,17-03-2020,great access to portal,great access to portal assessors were of great help only wish there were some sort of live access to share screens when needed help to edit images

4,15-03-2020,has been a great learning experience,has been a great learning experience and had some fun timesthe only down side is that prac is not long enough has been a good flexible option to study two days a week at college and the rest at home and is perfect to fit around family commitments
3,15-03-2020,interaction with course coordinators,interaction with course coordinators the sense of student community was lacking even though i tried to interact with other learners the coordinator needs to do an audit of working links throughout each unit as other leaner kept leaving comments like link not working or just downright negative which is not productive at all maybe add an additional comment box to the comment box just for report errors turn around time for assessor to get assessments back really affects the two year original limit for learning which put extra stress on ability to learn comfortably you should increase the course time to take into consideration the  week assessment return time you need more web conferences for the hardest concepts of the course coding  java script html database sql just a bit more from the college would have been helpful but overall the assessor were positive and helpful when assessments were not right which was appreciated thank you for your efforts there is always time for more research and that is something that i constantly lacked but we all need something to improve on
4,14-03-2020,when ever i called to speak to a,when ever i called to speak to a representative they were always helpful plus the trainers who i had dealt with were helpful too i would recommend open colleges as my experience with them has been great

3,10-03-2020,i enjoyed my studies but found it very,i enjoyed my studies but found it very frustrating that a good  of links to content that would assist in studies were always broken
1,10-03-2020,slow painful process from start to finish,very slow painful process throughout the whole course firstly they transitioned the course right after i started forcing me to do gap assessments instead of advising me to wait until it was transitioned over such a long turn around for a reply when reaching out to trainers and assessors about coursework content throughout the course was often not updated with links not being available many grammatical errors and information errors the assessor i had missed my appointment multiple times that i had booked off work for so wasted my time and effected my finances the wait time for anything whether it be a response to a query or having assignments marked or waiting for replies was far too long some of my assignments were marked unsatisfactory just because the assessor didn't read or look properly at the submission big gap between student support and assessing team meant that i never received correct information after i finally got my assessor to complete the final interview for my ssiq after doing nothing for a month they then left me waiting again then after it was finally completed they said my certificate would arrive shortly this was told to me by my assessor and also in email after  days still no certificate i touch base with student support only to be told it will take wks definitely not the  days or shortly i was assured of disappointing experience i work full time and studied and basically did it all alone as i realised quickly how little help open colleges staff actually were they could not handle the requirements or demands of the qualification definitely felt like they just want your money and then forget about you i don't even know what all the money i paid went to the website and content isn't even done well you think they would at least make sure the content was available with working hyperlinks etcwould not recommend doing a course through open colleges go to tafe
4,07-03-2020,i thoroughly enjoyed studying with open,i thoroughly enjoyed studying with open colleges i took a little longer than i expected due to working full time and raising children but open colleges team were more than happy to accommodate my situation i received ample help and support along the way and the process was relatively easy
1,06-03-2020,stressful disappointing and not worth it,the communication between me and my assessors was terrible in terms of having assignments marked i had to get several extensions after finishing all my assignments just because i was waiting weeks for assignments to be marked i finally got all my assignments marked and had my assessor tell me i had passed i then waited weeks and didnt receive any proper confirmation i contacted this assessor multiple times to find out when my certificate would arrive i was told it would be sent out to me as soon as possible after waiting approximately  more weeks i called open colleges and was told that no one even ticked the box to say i had completed they admitted this was an error on the behalf of open colleges i would love to do another course through open colleges as online study suits me however i cannot justify spending the money and dealing with the stress of having to go through all of this again i have not once received any form of apology or compensation for the stress and total lack of organisation it felt like once i paid my money for the course i was simply tossed aside and there was no commitment or care for me completing my course
1,05-03-2020,avoid it,i have studied multiple courses and i have never experienced such poor customer service and communication i wasted months doing incorrect subjects and assignments huge assignments to only be told almost at the end of my course that i should never follow the online portal because it's never accurate i finally finished my diploma through very gritted teeth on the th of november last year and i still have not received my certificate i have called and spoken to open colleges multiple times and the best i can do is leave a complaint form or fill in a stat dec as of today saying i never received my certificate i cannot even get confirmation that it has been posted or the name of the tafe that the certificate is coming from so that i can follow up myself dealing with open colleges has been nothing but a horrible stressful and draining experience avoid it at all costs

3,03-03-2020,aged care course,the teachers were good and very friendly it was just a frustrating experience to have the course finish date pushed back because of teachers leaving i feel like it should be their responsibility to always ensure an educator is available so that classes don't fall behind on their schedule
2,03-03-2020,early childhood education and care,my course that was suppose to be  to  years ended up being  and my teachers from advanced diplomas couldnt answer or help me with questions as wasnt it relevant to my study poor marking efforts having one assignment marked and getting it passed then they changed assessors  making me do it all again making me do  weeks in total of non paid living away work experience was disgusting on your behalf will not recommend this to anyone
1,03-03-2020,don't do it,better off studying with tafe and more trusted avenues my experience was horrible i paid way too much for something i never got because their units and site is full of crap i've studied many qualifications by far this was the worsti tried multiple times to complete assignments contact teacher for support i got nothing these fake money scamming fk tards and liars
1,03-03-2020,just criminals no compassion or care at all no morals,started my course in around june this year however due to unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence i was unable to complete or continue course i only managed the first quiz never used support team etc i have an bachelors degree and wanted to progress in study further however the strain of this was too muchi completed a special circumstances form along with my protection order and supporting documentation they said i can drop out but need to pay the full cost of the course out no options to transfer money to another course after some time no compassion or care at all no real beliefs or morals in helping people to achieve their study just criminals do not waste your money and time in this company
5,03-03-2020,an exceptional experience,i enjoyed the flexibility oc offered to me and my family when we chose to travel gave me the opportunity for new experiencesmy trainers and assessors have elevated the course to exceptional standards and were helpful through the challenges i was facing personal and otherwise i am forever appreciative of themto the amazing support team who were always available when i had a question or had issues while out on practicals you were amazing
4,02-03-2020,helpful tutors and student support,the college was very helpful with extenstions that i required for various reasonsassignments were often long and the final portfolios during work placement were also detailed and comprehensive role plays that are included in the final exam were not as intimidating as i had expected and the tutor was encouraging and gave helpful feedback
1,02-03-2020,never again,this is the worst studying experience to date wouldnt get responses for months wouldnt get clear communication on what was happening with anything had to constantly call and chase wasnt until i asked to make a formal complaint that i got a response this was  months latermy advice study anywhere else but open colleges
3,02-03-2020,room for improvement,throughout the modules some hyperlinks don't work and it also has spelling and grammar mistakesif you worked full time and had a family it will be very difficult to complete the course within the  months allocatedthe video assessments are very involved and will require other people to assist on occasion they also require more time than indicated to provide and show all the information the students are expected to give meaning that often information gets prioritised and discussed but not necessarily demonstrated and then you have to resubmit video assessments in order to show you carrying out that activity instead of just detailing it
1,02-03-2020,endeavour from hell,i believe a lot of people are attracted to open colleges as they offer payment plans they're incredibly attentive when selling the course however rest assured that this contact will cease as soon as you've signed the bottom line i study at university full time and work part time this certificate iii in individual support was just to gain industry experience for my masters program and unfortunately it turned out to be the endeavour from hellthere are major issues with course content assessments student support teaching support and placements student support via a live chat do not help with assignmentrelated queries rendering them mostly useless instead you must message a tutor and wait any number of days for a response learning materials offer surfacelevel learning with masses of written content sometimes they'll have taken a youtube video from somewhere and added it to their content but more often than not these external sources are 'broken' in response to such and other content issues relating directly to assignments i was told to google itthe assessment items are incredibly dull and repetitive and they do not promote an effective learning style once you have submitted an assignment you're meant to have your marks within  business days this is not the case marking can take up to  weeks you'll get your grade back and in some cases the result was unsatisfactory because i had mistyped my student number or name so i'd fix the error resubmit it and then have to wait another  weeks for it to be approvedthese abhorrent delays combined with the pathetic content have you wondering from the very start where the thousands of dollars each student is paying is going furthermore the delays mean that you are then very unlikely to be able to complete your assessment items within the mandated time period to complete the course therefore many students find themselves having to pay anywhere up to aud for an extension of up to  months if that still isn't enough for many it's not your course will be closed your money will not be refunded and you will be left with nothing and thousands out of pocketi particularly warn anyone who is going to be doing a course that requires industry placement many places and you can't blame them do not take students from open colleges i found this out the hard way after spending  months applying for placements the colleges says that it helps with finding placement it doesn't they'll send you a form with hints and tips about how to make phone calls and write a resume they do not have preferred providers in many or any areas so you're completely on your own i found my placement through distant nepotism due to the nature of the course i began my placement completely underprepared but was lucky enough to have a wonderful supervisor who showed me the ropesi could go on with pages of documented issues i've had during my course but i don't want to waste any more energy on this pathetic organisation what i do want to do is to warn absolutely everyone and anyone i can not to study here under any circumstance
1,02-03-2020,marking assessments very slow,marking assessments very slow you gonna make a thousands of calls before your assessor gonna mark your assessments you will keep emailing all the time you would never get reply that what i have been through with open colleges before getting my certificate but hopefully they would change their ways to make it better
5,02-03-2020,open collegues was a beautiful,open collegues was a beautiful experience to improve my knowledge and skills in human resources to return to work since being the mother of two girlsthe knowledge was professional and personal because i had to improve my habits to achieve the discipline necessary to achieve daily student objectivesthank you very much open collegue for all your support and teaching in my professional career you are excellent
2,01-03-2020,would not recommend,from the adminstudent support through time the course and the setup within the online system i would absolutely not recommend open collegesthe student support dont follow through with any enquires and i had to ring multiple times just to get anything done they make you jump through lots of red tape to do anything often i would ask about something simple to be sent and it would be promised to me within a couple of days more than a week later and it still wasnt done id call again to follow up same process can take weeks to get what you are asking for sometimes monthsthe course setup on the site was hard to read and reference as you have to go to a new page each topic having to search through all of the pages to find where a small paragraph of text was frustratingcommunicating with the assessors is useless as it can take a few days between each correspondence for the assessor to respond this means it can take up to  weeks for  or  back and forth questions rendering their assistance almost uselessthe course itself had multiple spelling and grammar errors for any teaching references spelling and grammar errors are just unacceptablei wouldnt recommend open colleges to anyone let alone the course both the system and support were not student oriented
5,01-03-2020,happy student,a friend recommended open collages to me she studied and qualified through open collagesand working fulltime now as teachers aidto be honest i was a bit sceptic about online studying and didnt study for many years i was always use to a class setup i called open collages and never looked back since the lady that interviewed me were very helpfull and friendly she explained everything step by step very well as i realy did needing all the help i can get the open collages setup  profile  page were a big help aswell its professionally done and with a big smile user friendly your profile modules and feedback area to assessors is well doneas english is my second language i need all the help and information i can get and open collages nailed it everyone that are interesteddont be put down by the negative reviews thank you open collages for giving  thousands of students this opportunity to study and reach their goals
3,28-02-2020,newbie,im new to oc but been reading heaps of bad reviews i just hope my decision is correct in enrolling through them hope all students get the support they need we wll need esp for workplacement
1,28-02-2020,they want your money,seeking legal helpwould not recommend them to anyonetold people and family about them
1,04-03-2020,dreadful experience,dreadful experience course had to be extended since it took up to two months to get each module back and they won't open up the next one currently have a complaint registered for  weeks with zero responselocked out of the course even though everything has been submittedcurrently  down for nothingcan't believe tafe put us on to themstay clearlook at the response to my review please reach out to student support did you not read that i have a complaint registered with you with no response for six weeks typical standard response with no intent of rectifying a problem
2,28-02-2020,trainers slow to respond when providing assistance,i was s student for  months with dual certificate  leadership management  business administrationduring this time i found it extremely difficult to reach trainers and get useful direction or coaching from them  this is often reflected in many of the student discussion boards within the openspace platformthe only way trainers are contactable is through messages in the openspace platform  the response often came a number of days after i needed assistance which in turn resulted in my studylearning being broken while i wait for a replyif i did send a message through the openspace platform  i had to log back in just to check whether i had a reply as there is no email notifications sent to students when a grade or a reply is sent back  again this causes a long break in my studylearning just waiting for assistanceto improvei would recommend offering students a 'live chat' options where trainers can be asked a question and an answer given immediately maybe have set times where a trainer is available and online to do so  similar to a online webinar where students can chat and discuss with the trainers their questionsalso developing an email notification system to notify students when a reply or grade has been received in the openspace platform to avoid logging in multiple times just to check for a response  again this wasted time
1,27-02-2020,i signed up for a course and cancelled,i signed up for a course and cancelled within the cooling off period which by the way is only  days   month later i realise i am still being charged for the course  i call open colleges and am assured my course is cancelled  i am once again charged  i call for the third time and find out the first two times nothing was done and after  days i will no longer be debited  today which is  days after that call i contact the debit company who have heard nothing from open colleges  here we go again this time i have been told  business days  stay far far away from open colleges all they want is your money
1,27-02-2020,a nightmarego elsewhere,i studied certiv interior design  but got in contact with diploma students as well and the experience is terrible for everybody i would rate the content a  dated broken links shallow google was my best friendthe assessments were very thorough and also confusing in the way requirements were formulated the requirements list is  pages per assessment and the assessors are tough  not briefed on the course contentthe whole experience felt like being in year  of school learning from a kg book but having to pass naplan exams for year my submitted assessments were always around  pages that will say something about the needed amount of work  definitely not hrsweek as oc claimstalking about help and academic support forget it oc has a student support team which is very active but cannot offer academic support oc student support helps with admin issues only access to your course content or course extensions students forum presented as an option  is actually dead  nobody there the academic support comes from your assessor only it is vague and sometimes it doesn't come at all  depending on the assessor grading was also inconsistent depending on the assessor's experience  the less experienced the worse your grading without proper feedbackit would be interesting to know how many students actually graduate with oc i bet not even half i met so many on social media they feel hopeless and discouragedluckily i have two bachelor degrees  one in campus and one in distance learning and a couple of international certifications heavy stuff some done in campus others online i experienced different styles of learning in australia and europe so i can confidently say it's not students'fault but open colleges'i enrolled in this course because interior design was my hobby and i was hoping i could learn the science behind my skill and start my interior design business i graduated but i do not feel i learned much it was an epic waste of time and moneyi am trying to find a reason why someone would enroll in these oc coursesa knowledge  no you learn more from books magazines online articles and reality shows  google was my best friend when looking for answers to my design dilemmas why pay   for thatb accreditation  well dia does not back it up but the course is still accredited by the australian department of education however oc cert iv and diplomas are not well regarded in certain states eg wa so the only jobs for you will be in retail kind of dead end selfemployed you don't need that piece of paper anywayif you really want to learn forget about accreditation look for practical courses that actually teach you something there are a couple much cheaper online otherwise if you want accreditation go with a local tafeuniversity our local tafe charges less than oc for a diploma in interior designplease read more reviews on product review as they have more in depth explanations of various experiencesoc officially changed their course since i graduated but students who transitioned say the content is still the same while assessments are even tougher and longer
4,27-02-2020,the online experience was very easy to use,the online experience was very easy to use having everything accessible in one place made it easy to navigate assessments the assessor left good feedback on assignment that i did that were encouraging and helpful if i needed to make any corrections on my last assessment i received a audio feedback from a assessor which for me made it easy to understand how to fix up answers the only suggestion i wont make to improve the website would be as assessments are completed they get checked off or highlighted as they are done
5,26-02-2020,my first attempt on online study,it was my first attempt on online study  i was a little apprehensive at first as i have always been hands on face to face classroom study to my surprise studying online exceeded my expectationshaving study buddies and others in same situation as yourself  the online assessors and facilitators have been extremely supporting and always responding to any questions or concernsit took me  months to complete my course and i am very proud at my age in early s able to attain a certificationthank you open colleges  i definitely recommend and would enroll in another if need be in future
4,26-02-2020,i liked every bit of my course,i liked every bit of my course the courseware was basically an essentials guide to preform well in my daily job and covered most areas in my field in detail i would highly recommend oc's for any online study and enjoyed the online the flexibility
1,25-02-2020,wouldnt recommend it,i wouldnt recommend open colleges the contents of the course is outdated by many years thats also many mistakes on the units plus many resources that doesnt work i called support countless time and they never had a solution
2,22-02-2020,i found the support services to be,i found the support services to be below average and i was very disappointed in the ability to ask questions and get a timely response the it system was inadequate and the numerous errors and mistakes in the course work were disappointing the course work didnt reflect contemporary examples as much as i hoped it would
5,22-02-2020,i had an awesome experience with open,i had an awesome experience with open collage for the last two years i studied my diploma in early childhood education and care and it was an honour to be one of the open collage students the openspace is very easy to access from laptop or mob you can easily check your messages results and contact your trainer and assessor the assessors and trainer are always available to reply to your message and enquiries i liked the assessment helper which gave me clues to finish my assessment quicker than usualthank you open collage
5,22-02-2020,help team were always super helpful and,help team were always super helpful and friendly was always a pleasure to call assessors prompt in marking and responding thank you to all the team and assessors for getting me through
1,21-02-2020,absolutely terrible experience overall,absolutely terrible experience overall they are unorganised incredibly slow to reply often they dont reply at all i had to call several times for the same thing as they kept telling me they would email me the following day but never did i was given incorrect information about the expectation of the course several times highly recommend going elsewhere regardless of your situation this one is not worth it
1,21-02-2020,what a joke they will promise you the,what a joke they will promise you the world and tell you exactly what you want to hear until you sign up for a payment plan or pay in full then practically ghost you student support is non existent and god help you if you happen to have a special circumstance arise run in to some difficulties and need an extension it's going to cost you  do your self a huge favour and contact your local tafe
1,21-02-2020,my hugest regret,i would never recommend open colleges to anyonethe course i begun had so much irrelevant information and assignments that were confusing to understand the marking period took at times weeks and feedback from teachers was painfully slow and put a huge halt to progressing on the coursemy husband was making the payments for this course  as i am a stay at home mum of  children and also homeschool and he got so frustrated with the whole process he stopped making the payments and my course was obviously suspendedbut rather than being happy with the money they had already received open colleges have now slammed me with a  debt and handed this onto debt collectors threatening us with courti do not have the money to pay them back at all and we have some huge debts at the moment including funeral and cremation costs as we just lost my mum this has been a devastating bill to out family this will now affect my credit rating all over such a greedy companystay away from this company simply money hungry
4,21-02-2020,i enjoyed my course,open colleges gets a bad wrap for all the wrong reasonsif you are self motivated and task driven this company is great the website is well laid out and assignments are pretty straight forward there was a couple of technical errors throughout my enrolment but nothing of major concern overall my assesors were really cool and easy to talk to and happy to help me whenever i needed and the fact that everything was online and i could complete my placement at my current place of employment made the whole experience super convenient sad to see that you are no longer providing animal courses otherwise i'd be enrolling again straight away
4,21-02-2020,while the course information was,while the course information was relevant and easy to follow the 'other resources' were jumbled and hard to find and that there isn't a lot of support if you do have questions and need help sometimes some online tutoring would have gone a long way in helping to understand some of the topics especially with assessments there really isn't any encouragement or opportunity to create study groups which again would help with support
4,20-02-2020,really great company to study with,really great company to study with by the end my assessments were getting marked really quickly sadly at the start i would wait up to  weeks for my assessments to be markedthankyou to the educators that supported melyndal and opilla
5,19-02-2020,very good service and the course is,very good service and the course is also well written the materials are well laid out easy to follow and interesting and with the help and support of open colleges lecturers my family and friends i very much enjoyed the coursethank you
4,19-02-2020,diploma of social media marketing,open space is an easy to use online platform with a fairly active student support system course was very manageable and instructive and i would recommend open colleges as a great institution for furthering your education
5,19-02-2020,overall very good,the diploma of counselling through open colleges was perfect for my needs as a fulltime worker i found the content to be broad and deep for a diploma level and the trainers were knowledgable and helpful special mention to alex nicol for his outstanding feedback and guidance where needed
5,18-02-2020,i would recommend open colleges to,i would recommend open colleges to colleagues and friend i made a big career changed from science to pa in finance and doing the certificate iii in business administration helped me so much that i could help others it helped me understand what was required of me and how to do my job thoroughly and with confidencethe lecturers were very helpful thank you paul gonzales and rosalie pellew for being so patient with me and the help that you gave me this has been a pleasant yet sometimes a stressful experience which i have enjoyed
1,19-02-2020,do not recommend,i have been waiting and waiting for them to communicate with me keep being promised they will get in contact and they don'ti enrolled to to the diploma of marketing and communications and took some time off while pregnant due to severe morning sickness have since resumed and completed my soa with them but they wont grant me access to the rest of course as it is no longer on offer and been transferred to tafe nsw which is fair enough but i should be entitled to a refund and they just keep avoiding me when i call or emailso a big thumbs down on customer servicethe content also a big thumbs down none of the content is their own they simply point you to external videos and articles i could probably find myself the assessments are not well written and the feedback you get from assessors is very vague and poor avoid at all cost i highly recommend going else where for your trainingedit  in response to their reply i have called and emailed several times and still i do not get a response just that someone will get back to me yet they never do
4,18-02-2020,the only thing i would suggest is,the only thing i would suggest is letting students know monthsweeks before their end date to let them know which assignments are outstandingi was notified in december that only module  was outstanding but then  months later they figured out that one more assignment in module  was outstanding too which was frustrating to me cause i shouldve been notified about both modules in december to begin withother than that student support have been friendly and helpful
5,16-02-2020,positive environment,professional approachable positive teachers as long as you are willing to learn for couple of hours every day its very achievable and also affordable thank you open college for helping me become a confident and competent nurse
3,14-02-2020,i am very happy i completed my diploma,i am very happy i completed my diploma it started out well enough but the portfolio's were quite a challenge they were huge pieces of work and i would have done better doing  days a week rather than  and completing the work as i went  there was a significant lag in time making appointments for checkins some of the modules seemed to repeat themselves especially the supplementary portfolio the live interviews consumed precious time and had no practical application what would've helped is being being able to listen in on educatorparent conversations the feedback on assessments was always positive and constructive and emailed questions were replied to promptly
4,13-02-2020,online learning  cant really be completed individually,there was a lot of helpful sites and videos to watch throughout the learning material however the actual assessments had very little instructions i found they were too vague and i often wasnt sure if what was requested would fit within the word count allocations for someone who doesnt want to have to ask questions and wait  days for responses it would be ideal if the writing was either more clear or there were more webinars the power point presentations werent more in debt most of the time they just were recording the assessments word for wordi had about  of assessors respond quickly  holly being the most helpful by the wayi think the biggest thing that should be made clear to students before starting the course is that you will need someone to take part in your learning for nearly  of the course with audio and video recordings it can be quite difficult for people who are on the move to get other people organised to take part perhaps assessors should line up for  minute discussions  oral quizzes might be a better demonstration of learning for each moduleoverall i would say it is very important to try and give yourself time to complete an online course as not all responses can be quick as online media is designed for the course does provide a lot of useful information to point you in a direction for an area where you would like to focus more time on it is definitely a very broad diploma of business i would have liked to see more financial discussions throughout  something more specific and detailed to thoroughly understand budgeting financials such as wages income expenses maybe a breakdown of a week at a restaurant or store would be a good examplethanks for the learning material but i strongly recommend more webinars and less interaction required from family and friends to take part in our individual learning
4,13-02-2020,great option for study user friendly and relevant material,i enjoyed my course with open colleges i found the material very relevant to the industry today and the course provided some excellent resourcesthe open colleges portal and systems were user friendly however i did feel there were areas regarding communication with tutors and support which lacked timely attentiveness when i startedi felt this was over come with the introduction of the online chat option and responsiveness increased with the marking and tutor engagement towards the last months
5,11-02-2020,great online course as i live in a,great online course as i live in a rural remote area
1,11-02-2020,worst study experience ever,all they care about is taking your money terrible support terrible course content gave incorrect information about course completion which meant i lost all my money and got no qualification at the end i've studied online with other instutions and universities previously and had great experiences but my time with open colleges has been terrible
1,11-02-2020,worst college ever,worst college everall they care about are the payments they don't suport students and they reply very late i have huge financial issues now because of them and i also developed huge anxiety and stress if they don't refund me i will take it to court i can't even complete the first module because the assessments are so confusing and unclear they don't help out with the questions and the people who answer me are not professionals do not study with them they will steal your money
1,10-02-2020,i would not recommend this open,i would not recommend this open college if you have any lifechanging issues making it difficult to study and require deferral or cancellation they will not help they won't refund the course components you haven't had access too absolutely appalling i'm not even sure how they can get away with a day coolingoff period misleading information and theft as far as i'm concerned i will be taking this to court i've been to university and never had to pay for a unit i haven't started
5,10-02-2020,it was a roller coaster for mecourse,it was a roller coaster for mecourse content was very good but not correctly sequenced i also found having to print scan and upload a very difficult and expensive task since i do not work i wish the college would offer these facilities there also needs to be a steady team of staff for a  months course i had  different educators each with there own method it was quiet confusing more student support in terms of checking if they are going alright
4,09-02-2020,very happy for the most part,was very happy with all aspects of the course except that it was often quite difficult to get a hold of assessors  on line and phone support was excellent howeveroverall a good experiencecheerschris
5,08-02-2020,highly recommend open colleges,i cant recommend open colleges more i had to extend my course and they were so great about it the whole process from joining course administration and the training assessors have all been fantastic throughout highly recommend
1,07-02-2020,not worth the time or money,i have emailed student support four times recently no responsethe course is out of date with broken links to youtube videos in the content the assignments are terribly written so that they make little sense and are open to student or assessor interpretationoverall a frustrating and not very appealing experience would not recommend
5,07-02-2020,great for wanting online study,open colleges is a great choice for someone who wants to do online studying with flexible hours so you can study at your own will student support is great and so are the assessors highly recommend
2,06-02-2020,very disappointing experience,took too long for assessments to be marked and for support to get back to you when i started it stated  days for assignments to be marked this is now  days and some assessments took over a month to be marked it says student support will respond within  hours i still hadnt heard back from them  months later would not recommend all links are out of date or do not work thankfully ive got my certificate but would not recommend them nor study with them again will be telling everyone i know not to study with them
5,06-02-2020,flexible and supportive,i found open colleges to be the perfect way for me to study around work and family very flexible and great with support and communication
2,06-02-2020,would not recommend,the student portal is clunky and useless  there's no easy to easily see what assignments are due hour much you have accomplished or what is coming nextspecifically regarding the cert  of education support the assignments and exams were grueling and bureaucratic rather than practical and useful i learned how to fake my way through and answer questions to tick the boxes but very little in the way of useful practical skillsmaybe it's just my style of learning is not suited to online study or maybe it's just this particular course but as for me i would not recommend it to anyone
2,06-02-2020,do not study with open colleges,have recently just finished studying with open colleges and gotten my cert iii however i would never study with them again they promise to mark assessments within  business days which is a big fat lie a lot of the time you're waiting for a month which is a huge pain in the backside especially if you have to make corrections and resubmit an assessment as you will have to wait another  weeks to get feedback there is little to no correspondence from assessors and trainers they are incredibly hard to get in contact with and student support sucks considering open colleges chargers more than most colleges i expected more please do yourself a favour and do not study with open colleges
5,06-02-2020,it was so convenient to study from,it was so convenient to study from home i had to juggle all apsects of my life to fit study time in but it was worth it i really enjoyed learning and feel very happy now that i have my certificate i can't wait to start working in my new career i thought all the assessorstrainers were very helpful supportive and positive i also found student support to be very helpful when i would email an assessortrainer of ring student support i always knew my question would be answered this was very reassuring i had a study buddy  just at the end of my course we meet at work placement she made finishing my course so much easier i think open colleges should keep encouraging this strategy to studnetsi would highly recommend open colleges
5,05-02-2020,marking times could be a little bit,marking times could be a little bit better  a six week turn around is not good when we as students expect a shorter marking time  other then that student support teachers and assesses are just lovely
2,05-02-2020,i chose to study with open colleges due,i chose to study with open colleges due to their easy sign up fully online content and no time limit for course completion as someone who has studied at multiple different universities and has a good idea about how tertiary education works i was shocked about how poorly open colleges structured marked and assesses modulesfor each assessment piece the cover page which explains the requirements of the task was horribly worded and could so easily be interpreted in a number of ways some sentences didn't even make sense leaving the student to guess the best they could to formulate an assignment based upon jibberish intrsuctions which would then be bounced back after  working days  of course by a marker who would also not provide you with adequate instructions of feedbackit is almost impossible to communicate with an assessor or someone from head office in times of needit took weeks of me sending email after email requesting for them to organise my assessor visit to my workplace for it to happen only to then be cancelled another number of timessome assessor were helpful towards the end of my study when talking on the phone for my checkpointsoverall i was incredibly disappointed with my experience with open colleges and would highly suggest that others look elsewhere to complete their studies
1,05-02-2020,horrific experience  do not enroll,horrific experiencea sales consultant from open colleges contacted my mother and sold her a course for me without my consent i was  at the time they then provided no support or resources and were incredibly hard to contact for help and advice due to receiving no support living a very busy life and suffering from severe anxiety i could not even complete the first assignmentnothing about equipment or programs were explained to my mother or me we were told adobe products would be provided only to be told later that they don't do thatafter hitting extreme financial hardship which included an eviction notice from our rental we were unable to continue paying open collegesbecause the course is in my name i am now facing the loss all of my belongings to a debt collection agency employed by open colleges the amount owed to open colleges is more than the value of all our belongings combined we are a young couple with a three year old son and this could be catastrophic for our familywe applied for hardship on the basis of illness anxiety and financial situation but were deniedi know now that i should have ignored the feeling of obligation to participate in the course created by the fact that my mother had already lined up a deposit for it and sorted out the entire enrolment prior to me even knowing about it and instead told her i wasn't interested we face losing everything we've worked for for over five years our home my sons security and our livelihoods because of this horrendously selfish company
1,04-02-2020,unprofessional and disappointing so glad its over,unfortunately my experience with open colleges was a big disappointment my trainerassessor was really nice but the entire company are way understaffed my assessor said she looked after  students alone in addition it would take several emails and phone calls to get anything actioned the company i did my prac with were equally disappointed with open colleges and the lack of professionalismmany of the assignments from the college featured multiple spelling errors and mistakes and when i mentioned this it fell on deaf ears  no response often the online multiple answer tests did not work properlythe prac theory was  pages of report writing and reflection that they wanted at the same time as your  hours of prac which simply wasn't achievable for parttime and fulltime workers so i had to spread my prac over  months just to do the theoryrather than facilitating and empowering you in your actual working experience it just seemed ridiculous and laboursome just disappointed and glad its over
1,04-02-2020,horrible,bad terriblei have been trying to study two different courses with them since  they took my money and i have no recived anything nor any helo throughout the process my first course wss deleted when i was nearly done they did not fix the issue the second course more mods and assesments were added on near the end of my course and timeframe was not extended to accommodate i asked for help iver the years and recived none now my course is over did not finish it i request an extention time over the last  months and it go denied so  later and still nothingdo not use them
5,03-02-2020,open colleges is excellent,open colleges has made online study a truly positive experience the modules and reading provided are easy to navigate the academic support is genuinely helpful and responds quickly and the guidance and support from the assessors is excellent the school i did my es placements at even commented that they had never had such excellent communication from a study provider before
1,01-02-2020,i would defiantly not recommend open colleges,i would defiantly not recommend open colleges to anyone my course went through a change to keep up with government standards pretty much you had only  months to finish the course if you were already enrolled not the full  years or you would have to start again with the new material i chose to start again as i had only completed  modules out of  and with working a full time job i would not get it complete in  months i spoke to student support to see if i would have another  years to complete after the change over and they said that they would extend the time for completion however little did they tell me that i would have to pay moreno help what so ever not with the course work placement or extensions if you are thinking of studying please please do not go through open colleges
5,01-02-2020,star training,open colleges gave me the opportunity to up skill in the comfort of my own home all trainers are amazing and very helpful they are all full of knowledge
5,31-01-2020,achieved my goal,as a mom of two kids it's great opportunity for me to go for further studies without going anywhere it would be possible only with the help of open college teams and academic and all support they provide me to complete my certificate  in childcare services  i highly appreciate their effort and help that they would provide to us all the time the best thing is during my course i got job and i am going to do further studies as a diploma in childcare again with open collegesthanksopen colleges team
5,05-02-2020,thanks for all the support visit over,thanks for all the support over the past two two years particularly with help sourcing a suitable work placement and also for extending my course
3,31-01-2020,a cheaper option to tafe but,open colleges are a cheaper alternative to tafe but there are hidden impacts such as lengthy and laborious credit or rpl processes communciation was at times patchy i found that the course work was often outdated with missing or broken links to further information interaction with other students was limited my course was set up for people actually working in the industry so newcomers would have really struggled especially in relation to the work experience hours and activities required student support was helpful though the there needs to be some reinvestment in the platform to compete with the likes of tafe
1,30-01-2020,not impressed,most of the website links in content material did not work assessors are almost impossible to get in touch with whether through student support or the messaging system instead of waiting  business days as predicted to receive feedback on essays i was usually waiting about a month or more and the last two assessments took    monthsliterallyto receive feedback on and i truly believe that was only because i demanded to talk to the manager because of many reasons one of the assessments that took the longest was actually the assessors wrong as i had attached all the necessary information but she had not looked at it and marked me as if it wasnt uploaded i am glad to be finished with my course but wont enrol with open colleges again
5,30-01-2020,i had a fantastic time at my course,i had a fantastic time at my course my teacher was great and i had lots of positive feedback course was easy to read and assignment were essy to upload i was worried at first going back to school at  but they added very flexible and supportive
5,30-01-2020,awesome experience  accounting course,i absolutely loved my training experience with open colleges and would highly recommend them the staff are very helpful and friendly trainers are very supportive and available for all kind of help i love their openspace system it's very user friendly and access all resources very easily definitely five stars from me
4,29-01-2020,happy to be finished,been an interesting experience with some ups and downs but have enjoyed the experience and learnt a lot about how to make sure you get the best out of everything
3,29-01-2020,student review,the tutors arent always the best sometimes they take a while to respond and mark however some tutors are brilliant respond within the day and are extremely helpful its just that inconsistency that lets it down
5,28-01-2020,great course teacher and contents of course,i never think about my second choice when my bas renewal is due each time open college course is practical and professional the teacher is very professional and knowledgeable i cant use my words to express my sincere thanks for kim she is patient and professional i learn many through the course and her it helps me to study further in a very professional method i will be back after  years many thanks again for colledge and course teacher love wenli
3,28-01-2020,cert  human resources,i found each of my assignments were worded horribly they seemed like there was as many long and fancy words as could be fitted in each sentence which could be easily misinterpreted at the beginning of each module i would commence the assignments and have to try to interpret them in whatever way i thought might be correct and hope i was right i think they need to be reviewed to be more clear in what they are asking and possibly having more prewritten assistance explaining more of the questions indepth i only had this assistance in the first few modules the rest had no guidance providedi also found the use of having to write a script for others to record them and myself for each module made me feel like i was being judged more on my acting skills i understand having videos is a way of seeing how a person can be in a situation however it is not a true representation of what could really happen in a real situation unless that situation was of us seeming awkward possibly only having this on some of the modules and on others possibly discuss the assignment through video chat with an assessor to show your understandingbesides the problems of clarity and videos i found the assessors helpful when i did have to ask for help and the amount of time given to complete everything was good
4,27-01-2020,great way to study but update some of the assessments for consistency,all of the essentials were there to undertake study  a good and thorough series of modules and referrences to the reading material as well as the trainers being easy to contact with prompt responses however while i was able to get through the assessments some of these assessments were quite old  in some cases and probably need a review to better relate to the website and referrence material as well as retain consistancy amongst other assessments and modules other than that its a good way to study
1,27-01-2020,if it could go wrong it did  most useless company ive ever come across,if it could go wrong it did the support team are the most incompetent people and changed their story  course requirements countless times forget about ever getting a call escalated or an issue resolved they kept promising to call back with correct info never heard back once ive spent well over hrs on the phone just trying to get this qualification finalised most useless company ive ever come across made the entire process for a basic cert iv incredibly stressful do not complete your qualification with this organisation
5,27-01-2020,thank you open college for all your,thank you open college for all your wonderful support it was definitely a challenge at times but i enjoyed it and feel so  empowered for finishing especially being a mature aged studenti enjoyed work placement  gained paid employment at that school where my son attendsthank you again and  i highly recommend this to anyone who has time to study at homefiona oconnor
5,27-01-2020,great course,i found there to be a lot of support it was a great course the only downside was the long wait in getting assignments graded
1,27-01-2020,well i've studying with many,well i've studying with many organizations and i was most unhappy more recently with the lack of openness of grading the time it takes to get things marked and lack of real coaching by some trainers no reference material or reference books you are on your own timeframes are ridiculous
2,23-01-2020,college needs to improve,completed my advanced diploma in accounting despite the college learning materials just a copy of text books with additional errors and some subjects like tax completely out of date assessments contain mistakes college not interested in improving material tutors helpful if you are insistent otherwise they show no interest much can be done by the college to improve a frustrating experience
1,23-01-2020,horrific verging on fraudulent thieves,they changed the course midway through and then cancelled it meaning i was unable to complete it despite having close to a year left on my enrollment they have basically stolen my course fee money and flatly rejected my claim for reimbursementavoid avoid avoid avoidthe education platform is incredibly slow and not at all userfriendly
4,23-01-2020,it was great,it was great all staff were really helpful and always happy to help you some of the assignments left me alittle confused but overall was a really good experience
5,22-01-2020,helpful,helpful encouraging and motivating
2,22-01-2020,the website worked well but delays with getting feedback,the website worked well and was current with the ndis etc however delays with marking and poor communication   still waiting for final feedback despite completing  the course two months ago   it appears to be a common problem when you read the student commentswould not recommend this course
5,22-01-2020,great online learning platform,online learning has it's ups and downs not having students in a classroom or a teacher in front of you however considering my situation age job and other commitments i could not have did my course in a classroom open colleges staff were always there to help me through it
3,22-01-2020,grateful for flexibility mixed experience,grateful for the opportunity to be really flexible with the course content and assessments however some of the assessments didn't match the content or were horribly wordeddifficult to understand not really asking what was expected some trainers are great and give amazing feedback to get a better understanding or answer questions with detail so you can learn others are not so great at all a really mixed experience with this coursemust be selfmotivated  a study buddy certainly helped
5,22-01-2020,high level of support,high level of support given when requested honest constructive feedback on assessments which helped to achieve a satisfactory grade as an older person studying online for the first time it did take me a while to become accustomed to this learning method bur once i realised that the feedback was constructive and designed to help me achieve i really enjoyed the course support was also available when i needed to extend due to familymedical issues recommend the course and open colleges
5,21-01-2020,great course,great course plenty of support and understanding when you need more time to study i really enjoyed this course
4,20-01-2020,certificate iii in business administration,i was very pleased with the online course and the support offered by the collegecommunication was very good and the ability to improve and resubmit assessments after feedback took a lot of the stress out of the process although i originally had a concern with managing the online learning system it was made very easy and i didn't experience any difficulties with downloading or uploading informationalthough a large number of videoaudio assessments were required i understand the government expectations for this it would have been very difficult however without a partner i could rely on constantlyi felt that a couple of the assessments were a bit repetitive in nature eg purchase of a printer for the organisation and then repeating this purchase in another module the whs requirementsoverall however i was extremely pleased with this course and thank the wonderful trainers and assessors
4,20-01-2020,animal care industry course,very detailed course material which gave me a thorough understanding of the things i need to know to work in the animal care industry the only downside was my course was updated halfway through which meant i had to complete additional assessments and tasks which lengthened the duration of the course
5,20-01-2020,well researched course material,well researched course material easy to understand and readily available to students very friendly and helpful tutors and admin staffwill definately recommend to all my friends
5,18-01-2020,open college gives everyone an,open college gives everyone an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills for any jobs and hobbies you want to do in your life time because i believe anyone can do it  but first we need to motivate our ourself life is challenging
1,18-01-2020,i enquired about this course but they,i enquired about this course but they do not spell out the costs  ad it is confusing  i have decided to do this with a university where i can at least obtain hecs support  i do not know why these organisations always avoid cost
3,17-01-2020,great trainers course needs updates,i enjoyed the course but a lot of the links and course content hasnt been updated in years and is missing some complaints in the comments section indicate its been like this for over  yearsthe trainers are awesome and their feedback on assessments was amazing this picked the score up to a
4,16-01-2020,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open college i did need extra time  but this was taken into consideration due to my circumstances and having completed the course i think it was a great achievement i would advise asking questions and using resources provided by open college reading the comments posted can help but if in doubt ask
3,16-01-2020,my experienced with open colleges was,my experienced with open colleges was good i was expecting more feedback and buddies to share knowledge but overall was ok teachers and trainers responses were quick support services need improved and also the assessments  some has trick questions or the teachers made difficult and some have mistakes
4,15-01-2020,good,the course was good and informative and very cost effective open colleges staff helped me when i needed it and were very flexible and understanding when i applied for an extention will do another course with them in the future
5,14-01-2020,open colleges has been helpful and,open colleges has been helpful and understanding throughout my diploma with any queries i had they went above and beyond my assessors during the work placement period were talkative and made my nervous self feel comfortable i went through my first pregnancyearly motherhood and full time work through this course and open colleges was more than accommodating to my unique situation in life i would highly recommend choosing open colleges to advance your career particularly if you feel like you have to squeeze study into an already busy life
4,14-01-2020,overall it was a good experience,overall it was a good experience i think that the last  modules of the course were review modules where assessments from the previous  modules were duplicated and therefore unnecessary work to be completed
5,14-01-2020,wonderful experience,great experience great help great learning material
5,14-01-2020,had a overall great experience studying,had a overall great experience studying through open colleges enjoyed the course and learned so much assessors were great and willing to assist whenever i needed and were quick to get back to me with any questions
1,13-01-2020,course was subpar and changed half way,course was subpar and changed half way through learning utensils were unhelpful
1,11-01-2020,it has been a very frustrating time,it has been a very frustrating time with the open collegethe waiting time for any response to emails calls or direct contact with the assessor has been terrible long which made my whole study time heaps longer and without pushing and putting in compliance i probably would still be waitingi had to wait over  month for one assessment to be approved
5,10-01-2020,great course,great course excellent staff
5,10-01-2020,open colleges was a great way to do my diploma,open colleges was a great way to do my diploma it was so flexible the student support team are extremely helpful as well as the trainers who are knowledgeable and responsive
3,10-01-2020,student support were always a great,student support were always a great help when needed however the course itself could be slightly tweaked so questions are better understood
1,10-01-2020,cheap postage method,open colleges is great to study with if your a confident learner how ever you put of lot money into your study so you would think they could atleast send your course material out to you with a tracking number instead of just with standard post now i have to go through the hassle of filling out a statatory declaration form and having to wait for that to be processed then get the material sent out yet again in standard post track and trace just makes life so much easier for everyone
1,10-01-2020,they're brave if nothing else,they're brave if nothing else i mean they asked me  an actual human who endured a year commitment to them  to provide public feedback so yeah i guess i'll give them that oh and i managed to complete a diploma of graphic design not through open colleges by through my own desperate determination the support of my peers and the miracle that is google so where do i even startlet's start with the course itself an overview of the modules makes it look satisfactory but once you begin to really engage with the content you'll realise how truly lamentable it is irrelevant superficial and outdated information repetitive filler pages on whs and critical thinking irony anyone broken links inane and unrealistic learning activities untrustworthy and unscrutinised sources and perhaps most disappointing a dire famine of actual solid technical instruction the only content of any quality were about  of the instructional videos and articles they lifted directly from adobe and lynda when this all became apparent to me i'll admit i was pretty miffed that i paid k just to be linked to the resources included in my  adobe student subscription but naive as i was i told myself yeah ok but at least you have trainers and assessors  actual experienced professionals  to teach you oh dear heart noof the  assessments i submitted i received helpful practical and relevant technical advice on one and it wasn't like here are some really good instructions that will help you improve this  lord no it was by the way you know you can do this right no explanation how just a cryptic hint  and for that crumb i was gratefulwith the exception of perhaps two or three extremely responsive and supportive staff members who sadly seemed to only have a minimal student load the trainers and assessors were about as helpful as my spanglishspeaking nontechnological abuela would be actually no that's not fair my abuela at least wants to help even when she doesn't know how these trainers and assessors often ignored messages until they were put on blast on the public discussion board or were dobbed in to student support they would offer the weak excuse that there were technical difficulties preventing them from seeing the notifications of new messages but ignored questions about whether this would be fixed not to mention that if they were aware of this issue you would think they would take responsibility enough to take the extra  seconds each day to manually check for new messageson the rare occasion such a trainerassessor did answer they'd make formidable political opponents so strong was there ability to dodge hard questions not listen to the problem and find nonanswers combining that with days weeks or even months of delays between responses and you can see why it was only sensible to just give up and get on with it the best you couldthen there were the actual assessments and the feedback following them the assessments were arduous repetitive and irrelevant  yes welcome to online education before this i completed my bachelor degree online so i'm under no delusions about the bleak reality of online study and annoying assessments however the woes did not end herethe resources provided for these assessments eg logos mockups etc were often excuse the jargon potato quality or just inaccessible rendering our designs unacceptable for our portfolios because of their inevitable amateur appearance further despite constant and very strong feedback from students the instructions in the tasks were so unclear and inconsistent that at times they were incomprehensible so not only were we made to complete inane tasks that would never fill the promise of well at least you have something for your portfolio at the end but we would be reduced to many teary ragefueled meltdowns in the processdid the pain end there pressing that submit button and breathing a sigh of relief that at least it was another torturous assessment task complete absolutely not the feedback that would eventually follow often on the cusp of or exceeding the alreadyextended businessday waiting period was reliable sure in that it always started with the same comment that we had named the assessment files correctly it seemed to me an odd thing to comment on until i realised that naming things correctly must actually be a rare skill at open colleges given how often they put the wrong student name on feedbackbeyond this reliable praise however feedback was usually vague and unhelpfully finicky and came with a  chance of being a withheld grade requiring resubmission sometimes it was because the student hadn't read the instructions correctly fair sometimes it was because the assessor hadn't read them correctly often it was because both had tried to read them but neither had truly understood so the student having tried to follow advice from previous students and dustcovered discussion threads took one understanding while the assessor took a different one given that we had to pay for monthly extensions after the first two years and that the course was being taught out i'll get to that these delays were beyond infuriating and the comments provided by these assessors were often as i said unhelpfully finicky and not constructive feeling more like feedback for the sake of feedback than actual thoughtful commentary rather than articulating and explaining areas for improvement so it looked suspiciously like a subjective opinion rather than professional feedback in the early days i was pretty vocal about these issues and even asked to be given clear marking criteria or rubrics to guide our work off but the feedback fell on deaf earsand then we have the technology the stage upon which this tragedy was set open colleges uses openspace it's not the best but it's not the worst see i can be objective it suffers from the usual bugs that are mildly annoying but workable the problem however is that it's a virtual ghost town staff as mentioned earlier rarely interact on it so neither do the students open colleges seems to be under the delusion that students will buddy up and connect through it so they based every assessment on the necessity of connecting with and getting feedback from other students thankfully the students banded together through their common hardship and supported each other on a more usable external platform without support from open colleges but before finding this shangrila of beautiful helpful supportive people most of us had to first spend months of despair wandering alone amongst the abandoned discussions feebly calling our own echoes for helpand finally the teachout it is with great relief that i understand open colleges no longer offers the diploma of graphic design flawed to the very end they even failed to clearly communicate to us that the course was on teachout however try calling them and you'll likely spend hours on the phone to hold music before being disconnected because someone apparently gave you the number to a phone line that doesn't exist the student populous first became suspicious a year or so ago when someone noticed that the course was no longer on their website but open colleges said nothing of this to us they assured us we could apply for up to  months of paid extensions to complete the course if needed but then as we applied our applications began getting declined shortened to only  months for most of us we work we have families we have other commitments to juggle and we had our plans to finish turned upside down by this sudden lack of commitment to the additional  months when we raised the alarm we were told we would all receive an email explaining the teach out and extensions we didn't all we've had to date are private casebycase responses and one sneaky reply to a panicked student message in the discussion board asking what teachout means unable to even trust that these longpromised extensions will be available to us when we need them many of us have decided it is safer to scramble out of the quicksand as fast as we possibly can trying to pull each other out as we goi entered this course enthusiastic to build my theoretical and technical expertise in graphic design and come out feeling like a professional then my expectations were brought down to just attaining the piece of paper that says i can do some stuff and i could teach myself the rest today as a new graduate i am embarrassed to admit where i got my diploma from and for as long as i possibly can plan on only describing my formal education as trained in graphic design and hope my work will speak enough for itselfi can't speak for any other courses but if they ever do reopen their diploma of graphic design i cannot emphasise enough how fast and far you should run
1,10-01-2020,avoid the graphic design course,poor resources out of date links and no actual teaching made my experience with open colleges one to forget feedback was virtually no existent and marking of assignments now can take up to half a month the main tutor md seemed more interested in how files were named rather than their actual content and his feedback was beyond useless
5,09-01-2020,the assessors are very helpful at,the assessors are very helpful at guiding you through all assessments detailed learning materials  related resources allow myself to understand and gain a good amount of practical knowledge highly recommend for people doing their traineeship in the building industry
1,09-01-2020,if i could rate them with  that,if i could rate them with  that wouldn't explain how terrible they are this course is really serious fraud they will call you  times until you pay them fees after when you need some help they will never answer and every time they will explain that they are short with staff they didn't reply my email for  months please never enrol with open colleges they are criminals
1,16-01-2020,an honest opinion do not give them a cent,regarding the cert iv in accounting and diploma of accountingunfortunately one star is the lowest you can scorethis isn't going to be some angry ranting overthetop dramatic review about my experience i will simply state the facts i found hundreds of errors hundreds that isn't an exaggeration errors in spelling math concepts etc you name it opencolleges found a way to make a mistake the staff and student support honestly didn't seem to care about the errors i took screenshot after screenshot and sent them in with my official complaint only to be told in the end we acknowledge that there are mistakes i am taking additional tax courses by hr block which i do recommend because the tax units were so riddled with errors that it was almost impossible to get through them i was so frustrated anxious and depressed more often than not due to the errors i would find it made studying very difficulti could go on and on but if i prevent at least one person from wasting their time with this nonsense then i will feel more accomplished than i do after completing a cert iv and diploma with opencolleges the certificate and diploma don't feel worth the paper they were printed ondon't let flashy discounts pull you in spend more on tafejust don't study with opencolleges just do not do itlooking forward to the sorry you feel that way response this review will receive from opencollegesedit notice the response from oc below they only addressed the spelling errors the spelling errors while a problem are not the main problem the errors with the content are the problem the mathematical errors are the problem they will dance around the issue and refuse to acknowledge it
1,09-01-2020,save your money and go through tafe,i would honestly never study through open colleges again especially not a health related course you are given all coursework and basically made to figure it out on your own with only one assessor you can depend on but even so she is only one person and can take a while to get back to you very difficult when you are juggling familylife commitments and set out time to study but when you need help no one is there there is no functioning group dynamic so you cant connect with peers the forums are totally useless  also when you do hand in assignments that are well done and in a tafe environment would more than equal a pass you are deemed 'unsatisfactory' and have to constantly resubmitto anyone considering doing health service assistant  aged care courses definitely go through tafe much better support you can talk to them directly and they have a more intimate role in your work placement from what i discovered
1,08-01-2020,ineffective,prehistoric and ineffective life changing in the worse possible ways
5,08-01-2020,fantastic,amazing working online was so delightful had the time and space to achieve my goals whilst still working full time was very helpful and no matter how many mistakes i made was able to try again
1,07-01-2020,this college has nothing to offer,this college has nothing to offer i have completed majority of my assignments and passed however no training of hrs is provided to complete the coursejust a waste of time and moneyi absolutely do not recommend this collegeif u also have outstanding payments they pass it onto the laywer who provides a summon will take u to courtknowing that im disabledthis is not how anyone should be treated
2,07-01-2020,not worth the money,the course was not worth anywhere near the money that was charged totally rubbish and never received a refund either
3,07-01-2020,functional but needs a lot of work,loved how easy the site was to use to download and upload assessment easy to navigate loved that i could study at any time in my busy schedule and upload assessments at my own pace the assessment questions sometimes made absolutely no sense it seemed like the person who wrote the assessment was trying to us as many intelligent words they could to ask the question which left me and others very confused on what the actual question was some questions were repeated later in the assessment but worded differently the online student support was never available when i needed it which left me needing to email my assessors or message which  i never got a response however nicole manning was fantastic i always got a quick response from her and answers i needed some assessments did not clearly specify what was required which left me needing to go back and do twice for example the work placement video assessment i for did not explicitly state that i was expected to list the steps i was taking in my video
1,06-01-2020,this school is a joke  do not study through open colleges,student services general organisation and communication amongst staff are awful i ended up doing over  hours of unpaid work placement due to being stuffed around messages and issues not being passed on by the people i spoke to and appointments and assessments not being made of followed up on even when appointments for assessments were finally booked the assessors neglected to call leaving me to follow up and prompt the calls myself none of my messages through the student services message centre were ever addressed i have finished my course and graduated now and if i call through to student support the automated voice still says i have queries that are being processed that's how rediculous the student support is noone communicates within the school which lead to two different assessors messaging me at once both wanting to book my face to face appointment every time i called about an issue i had to reexplain everything going on as messages or notes on my issues were clearly never recorded or passed on as each person i spoke to including the assessors and trainers had no idea i was even experiencing issuesstaffing issues are not a good enough excuse for the things that happened i am not happy or satisfied with my experience i paid for this course which i could have had for far less up front cost through tafe because i was assured this school it's services and materials were superior this is a lie i am currently studying through tafe and wouldn't hesitate to say they out perform open colleges in every wayi will be lodging a formal complaint with the quality assurance board for training providers as i do not believe i was given the experience advertised and i do not believe this training provider actually provided me with any trainingsave your money go through tafe
4,06-01-2020,would definitely reccomend doing a course through open colleges,great trainers and assessors who always provide you with the best guidance and feedback as necessary or when asked the course work was relevant and i found it very applicable to the work i do in my education career the courses are easy to navigate through and set out in a way which isn't intimidating and extremely achievable
5,05-01-2020,great support,i was so happy and squealed a little the day i received my certificate in the mail i took a little longer than most to finish my course and truly appreciated all the support i received thank you rosalie pellew paul gonzales holly radford peter mcclatchey bernard lewis and all the other tutors for answering my questions giving me feedback and encouraging me to do my best  many thanks also the wonderful staff in student support  when family and health issues impacted on my study they were only a phone call away without them i probably wouldnt have finished the course
1,02-01-2020,if i could have selected zero stars i would have,if i could have selected zero stars i would have open colleges are a complete joke from misspelt and out of date information to unrealistic grading times for assessments they have been nothing but terrible to deal with  trying to get in contact with their trainers and assessors is near impossible and when you do theyre arent much help would never recommend to anyone
1,01-01-2020,don't waste your money or your time,i'm pretty sure that any of the good reviews are written by them they're not a good company to study with look somewhere else the assessors are lazy and student support are useless
5,30-12-2019,sarah burgess,sarah burgess is a amazing assessor and always went the extra mile for me without her i believe i would have never graduated whatever she is getting paid it isnt enough
3,29-12-2019,the good thing about open colleges is,the good thing about open colleges is being able to study in your own time its great for full time workers butthe teachers take way too long to get back to you i understand you have a lot of students but you shouldnt accept everyone if you dont have the capacity to respond in a reasonable amount of time also open space was down for a few weeks this year and that really disrupted my learning
5,29-12-2019,great experience,great experience with helpful teaching staff i did find dealing with student services difficult at times especially when they insisted i had course work left to complete but the teachers said i had completed everything required to pass the course
4,27-12-2019,i thoroughly enjoyed the course but,i thoroughly enjoyed the course but thought at times my assessment marking was slowthank you
4,27-12-2019,studying through open colleges has been,studying through open colleges has been an amazing experience the support from the online team the trainers and assessors has been great throughout the course material was easy to navigate and well set out great experience
4,27-12-2019,certificate iii in education support,i had a great experience doing my course i really like that i can work at my own pace and if i need help someone is always there they have very helpful trainers and support staff and the assessors grade your assessments as soon as they canoverall i had a great experience and am now qualified as a teacher's aid
4,26-12-2019,loved it,loved it and graduated
4,23-12-2019,open colleges was incredibly generous,open colleges was incredibly generous with time extensions and over the phone support i was struggling often when it came to submissions due to an accident that had be flat on my back for weeks working fulltime and being a parent i explained my situation to student support and the support i received was fantastic i am now certified and working fulltime in mental health which is a long time dream come true thank you open colleges
2,23-12-2019,disappointed to say the least,unfortunately my experience with open colleges was disappointing to say the least no help from my assigned trainer had to wait  months to get modules marked modules never opened automatically after  hours as advised trouble downloading assessments as system was unavailable some of the trainer were helpful in the end as was my workplace assessor would not recommend
5,21-12-2019,positive experience to be had by all,my experience has been nothing but positive my questions to the assessor or trainer was always answered in a timely and friendly manneri had to extend my course a few times due to unforeseen personal circumstances and fulfilled my requests every time in accordance with their requirements  which i will always be thankful fornothing but
5,21-12-2019,i would highly recommend open colleges,i would highly recommend open colleges the support is absolutely fantastic i felt very anxious at the start of my course but with all the help and support i received i was able to complete my course confidently a big thank you
2,19-12-2019,review,the support was a joke really never there when you need them took way too long to get an answer and student support didn't know what to do eitheri don't think the course reflects the industry very well unless you work for a very big agriculture company if anyone wants to learn something about agriculture and farming and cattle go out there and do some work on a real farm not a course you will learn more on a property than on this coursethere was only a couple of assessors who were very helpfulsometimes it's not about reading books and regulations but about common sense
5,19-12-2019,love getting qualified with open,love getting qualified with open college lots of support relevant information interact with other students if you choose its all there  remember it's  all online so you need to be dedicated and strict with yourselflooking for study to enter new employment then try open college
5,18-12-2019,doing my diploma through open colleges,doing my diploma through open colleges has been great the whole process was very easy and being able to work at my own pace was fantastic all the assessors and support were very helpful and everything was done promptly from replys to my emails to the marking of assessmentsi completed my workplace assessment with rosan and he made it so comfortable and straight forward there was no need to be nervous at allit was a worthwhile and positive experience
3,18-12-2019,veterinary nursing review,i would only recommend vet nursing through open colleges if you already have employment in a veterinary clinic and have enough motivation to study online without the help of face to face communication although it was easy to get in touch with student support there would always be a delay in hearing back from the course assessors this can be quite frustrating if you need help on a particular assessment or question in port folio the communication and course requirements always differed between different staff members in student support which became quite frustrating other then that the course is very detailed in what you are required to do
1,17-12-2019,open colleges course,i would never recommend anyone to use open collegesthey are slow to respond to requests student support does not really help anyone referring you always to a trainer of which you have to book a team in the future usually  weeksinitially they stated they had support for people with learning disabilities but i received nil support even after completing a special test which confirmed i needed extra supportthe portal is incredibly slow whilst waiting for marking you have to call and get the next module opened all modules should be open so you can work at your own pacethese seem like blatant attempts to make the course run longer hence you must pay more for extensions increasing the cost many timesdon't use open colleges look at tafe
2,17-12-2019,disappointing experience,no one got back back to me on time marking assignments always took a long time noone seemed to know what was going on rpl process was an absolute disgrace so unorganised the person dealing with my file had no idea what they were doing put me off using open colleges again and would not recommend to anyone else
1,17-12-2019,the course content hardly related to,the course content hardly related to the assessments for referencing or research questions often were ambiguous  quizzes impossible that even trainers struggled with them for premium  i got very little i'd never recommend open colleges to anyone
4,17-12-2019,overall great course,overall great course i don't believe that the face to face visit should be filmed a person should come to the centre for that assessment
4,16-12-2019,the course was a bit challenging in,the course was a bit challenging in some cases i felt sometimes the course material wasnt always clear but the instructors did help a lot when needed
5,12-12-2019,open colleges support staff  were,open colleges support staff  were extremely helpful and the online learning was userfriendly  was a great experience i would recommend this college to anyone thinking of doing further study online
2,12-12-2019,wouldnt recommend,i really didnt enjoy studying with open colleges from the beginning there were links in assessments that were old and no longer worked as were there links that didnt work in the assessment helpers this just showed the lack of time taken to ensure that assessments stayed current as i got further into my course i realised how unreliable the assessor were one would say one thing was wrong but the other would say something else was wrong and what the first said was wrong was actually fine there was no consistency i also found that the questions never explained in enough detail what the assessor wanted to see there was many occasions were the assessments were sent back saying you havent included  when the question never asked for anything of the sort consistency was definitely not something that was shown there were many assessor who couldnt have cared to help and that was frustrating and very disappointing it says marking of assessments takes no more then  working day many times it took weeks and sometimes months there is definitely a lot to be worked onit took  months after finishing my work placement to get my workplace assessor to come out even though i had been trying to organise it for months beforehand once they finally came out i had to chase her for her report so that i was able to complete my course once everything was said and done i had to call them to find out where my certificate once
5,11-12-2019,i enjoyed the flexability and wonderful support,i really enjoyed the flexability of studying online and when it came to my work placement i was able to get the support and advice i needed my my trainers so easly it was great to study with open collages and i would recommend them to anyone who is wanting to gain qualifications and maintain a social life or a busy life style at the same time
4,11-12-2019,you guys have been really helpful and,you guys have been really helpful and understanding when i needed to extend my course due to medical reasonsi however thought that some of the assessments where a bit too difficult due to not enough information on the module bit overall i was quiet satisfied
5,11-12-2019,support staff were very helpful and,support staff were very helpful and approachable it was a wonderful experience studying with open colleges
1,11-12-2019,be careful,i started studying with oca in  doing a business diploma they made it incredibly difficult to finish the course delaying everything until my time had run out and i needed to get an extension for more money in the end i had to contact the ceo and seek legal advice so i can get my money back at this point in time im still in the process of getting my money back
1,10-12-2019,please avoid this company,i am very disappointed in open colleges and honestly wouldn't recommend taking the cert iii in education support course through themi quickly learnt that better learning material is available for free online than what was provided in the course modules and my grades reflected this as i received high distinction grades every time i looked elsewhere for information some of the assessments were interesting and helpful however i frequently found myself completing tasks that were completely irrelevant to the job role of a teachers assistant let alone a teacher which is a huge waste of timeoh and dont bother trying to think outside the box when answering questions oc are clearly working off a checklist so only want a genetic responseturn around time for assessments being graded took around a month when it was only supposed to be  dayssupport is available for students via live chat but they never appear to be online email support can take days and sometimes even then my query wasnt actually answered
4,09-12-2019,hieveryone,hi let me quite get my certificate then tell workmate and friends they're should be need learning course to your open space
5,09-12-2019,open colleges were very accommodating,open colleges were very accommodating for people who work full time  the course was very informative
4,09-12-2019,rural student  happy,every part of my journey has been a great learning experience  i could not have achieved this without the wonderful help from student supportthe assessors  are very knowledgeable and supportive and give you feedback on assessments which only helps you to improvemy wp supervisor was amazing  willing to share her personal experiencesmany thanks to you all  i will study with you again
1,09-12-2019,worse college to deal with,worse college to deal with stop the course i was doing not offering anymore but you still have to pay never respond to emails in tasmania they will not employ you if you got your animal veterinary nursing through this college
5,08-12-2019,happy to study at open colleges,open colleges has been a good experience overall i studied diploma in community services i was happy to work at my own pace in the time frame of  years the assessors overall have been helpful there's a lot of supporthaving completing my work placement assessment tasks with rosan has been good the preassessment video call was helpful to prepare me for the actual assessment and i felt less anxious overall i'm thankful for all the support and guidance the assessments were made easier to understand when working with rosan
3,08-12-2019,lots of delays along the way,lots of delays along the way some due to technical problems and changing decisions and difficulties with finding placements means that the extensions given eat into the next part of the pathway rather than really adding time to the course
1,07-12-2019,only want your money,only want your money they wont help you like they promised at the beginning they dont keep a record of any of the assessments you have completed they then tell you that you have a shorter amount of time to finish your course for a  year course they were making people complete it in  months or less yet you still had to pay every dollar do not study with this company
4,06-12-2019,studied cert  in education support,studied cert  in education support great for me personally as i could study at my own pace
5,06-12-2019,awesome supportive assessor,awesome supportive assessor thanks you
5,06-12-2019,i loved doing my course online,i loved doing my course online open colleges are very helpful and the course material is great
4,05-12-2019,thank you open colleges,had a bit of a shaky start but during my enrolment i have witnessed the course improve constantly more support has been added the live chat was a huge one a fast way to get assitance especially when stressed or worried there are some amazing teachers who genuinely care about the students which makes all the difference in the world the content is being updated and it seems like the staff are always looking for new ways to enhance the experience for studentsi did not have prior experience in this style of learning environment it was a bit of a shock at first being entirely online there are of course both positives and negatives although you can tend to feel very isolated the nature of the course is very flexible you can choose entirely when to submit your work as long as you complete it within the time frame the team recognises that support and communication with students is extremely important i do think it would be a big help to provide some more structureguidance to students to improve time management and to give an understanding of whether they're on the right track otherwise i am happy with my experience  and grateful to the team for their kindness and patience especially when providing me with more time to complete my studies thank you open colleges
1,05-12-2019,they only want your money,they only want your moneyi needed to do a course for my business the learning material was very basic and didn't cover much of what would be needed in the rolethe real stickler was that they don't clearly show that when you use their supervised exams you are still required to complete a supervisor declaration realising my error i submitted my supervisor declaration simply a screenshot of proctoru confirmations with  days until my course timeline was due to finish they classify this as an assignment and didn't mark within  days they can take up to  days so i have had to pay an extra  simply for them to doublecheck that i did indeed use proctoru
4,05-12-2019,not bad,not bad studying online is difficult if youre not motivated but easy if you are and work full time as i did not having someone face to face to show you things was challenging in its own way but if youre already working in the field it makes sense to choose them
3,04-12-2019,cert iv in accounting and bookkeeping course,overall i received what i needed from the cert iv in accounting and bookkeeping coursethe change in jan  from myob to reckon was frustrating however the course material improved with this change  more structured and professional less spelling and grammar errors and more relevant to the outside worldmore information around the modules being able to be unlocked all at once would have been useful at the start of the course rather than the back end via page links i found after module from the posted comments the awareness around short staffing long wait times for marked assessments and the difficulty in arranging a suitably timed student support call have done the rounds with good reasonthe reality is if you want to study online with no face to face it is quite difficult to do with little or no prior experience in the accountingbookkeeping space open colleges has had a good crack at it but some improvement is still needed
3,04-12-2019,has potential,the layout of the modules is greatthe trainers were always willing to help and mostly returned questions and assessment feedback quicklystudent support were always cheerful and happy to help outunfortunately i thought that each assessment was written poorly with instructions being unclear and confusingthey often read disjointed and with inconsistent terminology it seemed like it was written by a few different writers and was not proof read to ensure it all came together smoothlyi saw that other students often shared my frustration and confusion regarding assessment instructions as they posted their questions and feedback in the online portalall in all i enjoyed my experience with open colleges however the content needs urgent attention if that was fixed during my course i wouldve given  stars
5,04-12-2019,finished  courses with open colleges,i have just completed my second course with open colleges cert iv in bookkeeping in   diploma  advanced diploma of accounting tax now  being an online course it took a bit of discipline to keep on track time wise but my experience with open colleges has been a great one with excellent support from trainers and admin staff thank for an enjoyable learning experience
4,04-12-2019,i enjoyed studying through open,i enjoyed studying through open colleges and would use them again ifwhen i look to do further studies  there support was awesome  the only issue i had throughout was some misinformation which effectively caused an issue with work placement however this was quickly resolved by open colleges  thank you so much for helping me achieve my cert iii in individual support
4,04-12-2019,good course content,all good to deal with at the start i did find it harder to get a response from some lecturers but later on this improved dramatically the course content itself was really good but i am surprised they use reckon software as i have found it to not be as popular as xero or even myob
5,03-12-2019,appreciation,i am so glad i chose to complete my diploma of nursing with open colleges i knew right alway from the moment i stepped on campus that this is where i would begin my nursing journey the campus is clean and all the staff and students are friendly there was a supportive community atmosphere the simulation labs are so well made with plenty of equipment to practice your skills  i had the most amazing nursing lecturer she didnt just teach me theory but she made me work ready she was always willing to allow me to book the lab for one on one assistance and provided me with feedbackall the good feedback i received while on placement was a reflection of her teaching nurses i have worked with while on placement were impressed by the level of knowledge particularly with medications and  clinical skills thank you open colleges for having me as one of your students i absolutely recommend anyone who is passionate about nursing to apply with open colleges
5,03-12-2019,being able to study at your own pace,being able to study at your own pace was wonderful to fit in with my work and family
5,03-12-2019,horticulture cert ii course,i loved my horticulture cert ii course as a mature aged student i found it informative and sometimes challenging the support and feedback throughout the course was really good and actually improved along the way with the introduction of chat support and audio feedback for assessmentsthe only downside was i never received the combination meter which was supposed to be part of the course materials
5,02-12-2019,i have experience the best time of my,i have experience the best time of my life with open college the team at open college ollege provide the best service and the time nanagement was always  on time for me i experienced a close relationship with the team at open college each of ttheassesors were always very helpful and very understanding  i have achieved my goal and have become more confident in myself more then i ever have its given me a new me i am looking into another course to further my education love the feeling of achievement
1,02-12-2019,dissatisfied student,lacks student support and miscommunication between staff makes it difficult to know what is expected inconsistent between assessors and their expectations of assignments i have done a number of online certificates and even online at university i understand the commitment and determination it takes to study online open colleges is by far the worst experience i have had studying online the requirements of work placement were not discussed in any detail and finding an appropriate workplace during my course was extremely difficultfinding placement is completely up to the student and open colleges does not help the requirements of work placement defeated the purpose of online study if i had known the expectations in regards to this i would have looked into alternative options to study beauty therapy where i would gain more practical experience with support
5,02-12-2019,my course through open colleges was,my course through open colleges was great i could work at my pace which i really liked there was always support on hand if needed and all the support staff and trainers were great
5,02-12-2019,open college was there when you needed,open college was there when you needed support and when you wanted extension they were there to help
3,02-12-2019,the learning environment i feel didnt,the learning environment i feel didnt suit my way of learning going forward i would recommend attending tafe in person unless necessary
5,02-12-2019,i chose open colleges as i was working,i chose open colleges as i was working full time and couldnt attend schoolits best experience my assessor lovely lady very understanding and intelligent student support was wonderful though in beginning it all seems confusing but slowly i was able to understand things i would definitely recommend to my friends and family
4,02-12-2019,i had a good experience,i had a good experience i received help when i needed and the materials were availableone thing need to be explained somewhere is that assessments need to be answered in the format is given as some people happened to me too do not know and answer in blank format
1,29-11-2019,honestly i wouldn't recommend open,honestly i wouldn't recommend open colleges as they make it very difficult to graduate whenever you submit an assignment whether you have passed or not the assessors grade it as withheld the assessors need to assess the assignment for what it is and give the student an option to better their grade not force them to by withholding grades this discourages the students and makes the process slower to graduate i view this as a money grabbing exercise because the student has to extend their course because of the time it takes the assessors to mark their assignments it takes  working days for your grades to come back each time the assessors withhold a grade meaning that over time you will eventually need to extend your course and pay more money
4,29-11-2019,i found the assessors knowledgeable and,i found the assessors knowledgeable and the support team helpfuloverall a good experience
4,29-11-2019,i think communication between assessor,i think communication between assessor and students progress needs to improve on more than one occasion my assessor needed several reminders to complete work i was waiting on i also think the delay between completing assesments and marking needs to improve it took up to  weeks on average however whenever i rang and inquired staff were more than happy to help and had the matter sorted overall i was very happy with the service provided
5,29-11-2019,the trainers and assessors were amazing,the trainers and assessors were amazing and informative and the nature of the course being online was really convenient for me during this year alone i have moved to  different states and i was always able to reach out to open colleges for support and advice
5,29-11-2019,good experience with only one flaw and,good experience with only one flaw and that is the time it takes to mark assessments
1,28-11-2019,please avoid this company,please avoid this company it is a huge rip off and the course is set up with information as if a child has put it together all you get is a certificate at the end if you can even finish it as no one will take you on for work experience as this company is unprofessional and not taken seriously people have already taken this company to court avoid
3,27-11-2019,great teachers and extensive curriculum,great teachers and extensive curriculum i learned a lotopenspace and the admin of the course was a bit harder to navigate  unlocking of modules waiting for marking the dashboard not reflecting correctly the layout of the modules and the work placemement forms etc not that clear
3,27-11-2019,support was good but,support was good if you chased them for it however many assignments were confusingly written and didn't seem to have been created by a subject matter expert the course also doesn't make it clear on expectations regarding referencing requirements and the need to do your own research ie not all the assignment answers will be found in the course content
1,26-11-2019,this is one of the worse,this is one of the worse really bad tranning school in this country please dont study with them as they will waste your time and money
1,26-11-2019,dont try to sign any contract with,dont try to sign any contract with them as you will find out many problems and hard to contact to them when you want to cancel the course this is my worse experience ever in my life i would give a zero star if i can
2,26-11-2019,lack of support,lack of support communication was poor and often unachievable and grading was inconsistent
4,26-11-2019,review,found my teachers very easy to communicate with and they were relatively quick at responding all materials were easy to find and the site easy to navigate a few issues with sharepoint occasionally being down
5,25-11-2019,it was easy for me to study from home,it was easy for me to study from home and at my own pacecourse content was very goodi the trainers and assessment reviews were done quickly with great feedback i would highly recommend this course to othersi will definitely look at doing a course again with open colleges
5,25-11-2019,open college's have been nothing but,open college's have been nothing but supportive fluent and any problemissue resolved quickly and efficiently  more than happy to recommend open colleges
1,25-11-2019,nothing but lies so far,i have been trying to get support from the support people from my group adviser however they never appear to  be online  i have emailed the adviser and the support people and have had no answer at all over the last  days  i don't recommend them at all in fact i am considering seeking legal advise on how to get my money backin answer to the reply i had  that is what i tried hence this review in  months i haven't had a response to any of my questions
5,23-11-2019,enjoyed all the modules,enjoyed all the modules the learning material is easy and you get help when you need it  the hardest thing was trying to find your own work placement which was time consuming it would have been nice if there was already a place near your area where you can automatically go to and not have to hunt one down  other than that it was very enjoyable
2,22-11-2019,not great,some aspects were great such as having modules available by just contact student support and using a livestream for my observationshowever i have never dealt with such a frustrating company i would be ignored pushed aside and left in the dark about many aspects customer service is rubbish considering we are paying for the online service
4,21-11-2019,great experience,great experience only wish is that questions asked and assessment gradings were answered to faster
3,21-11-2019,the assessors were great,the assessors were great really knowledgeable and helped whenever i needed customer service was always happy and helpful as well many issues with uploading videos and a very stressful time trying to get them to be viewable by the staff if this was fixed then i would have given five stars
3,19-11-2019,overall it was ok,overall it was ok suggest to review the assessments as there are lots of repetitions and in the questions and context the formatting of the assessment questions is very poor and lengthy it felt that the assessment questions are focusing more in quantities and less in quality student services are great but sometime feels they dont have access to correct information on the progress an individual ie what is completed and to be completed suggest a self service option for student to view themselves
5,18-11-2019,easy to deal with,easy to deal withthanks
1,17-11-2019,absolutely no communication,might as well let the students run the place because no one is ever availabe or bothered to get in touch nothing is urgent to themvery clear open colleges has not even looked at my casemy overdue payment is with debit success who keep attempting to extract an overdue payment from my bank account after i told them i have contacted open colleges many times to try and sort outyou would think this would prompt them to get in touch with open colleges or me to resolve the issuenopedebit success ignored this and continues to deduct money from an account i told them has insufficient fundsontop of this i am incurring dishonour fees and they are still continuingattempting to deduct  that isn't there still without attempting to contact me  just going ahead doing their own thingneither debit success or open colleges has bothered to get in touch with each other to understand the situation let alone myself neither have bothered getting back to me dispite the numerous attempts of me trying to speak to someonewith this lack of support and communication i definitely will not be recommending this lot to anyone what a crappy way to treat people paying big money for such a cheap standard experience where no one is presentimagine if they were proud about working for open colleges nothing to be proud of it's like a farmyard over there
1,16-11-2019,please dont study with open colleges,please dont study with open colleges the quality of education is poor they make you sign a contract that says you have to pay your full fee if you cancel the course but that they have special considerations where if something happens and you can no longer pay or complete the course where you can get a refund this is a lie you will never be accepted for special considerations and they will force you to pay all the rest up front when you cancel even if you apply due to financial hardship they dont care they wrong answer your questions they wrong give you a breakdown if your fees because its apparently none of your business whoever i spoke to on the phone was horrible get everything in writing and they have changed their company name multiple times because they are a con
4,15-11-2019,i have recommended open colleges to,i have recommended open colleges to four friends two has completed their course one is about to start at the moment the other one is about to finish her course open colleges are very good to asses your assessment within a week or two when i started but it got a bit difficult for an assessor to asses your assessment nowadays educative and caring students support keep it up i will always recommend open colleges to friends
1,15-11-2019,worst online course experience ever,worst online course experience ever dont waste your money or time they make all the promises in the world and break every one of them claims of the premium price reflecting the turn around time for assessments being graded in  days and exceptional  days a week support blah blah is utter rubbish once they have you signed up they couldn't care less ignore all the good reviews because they are all liesstudent assessment module graded times exceeded  weeks and the proceeding moduel isnt unlocked until the previous one has been assessed i was told that even if the previous moduel had not been assessed that as long as it was completed the preceeding moduel would be available when this was a liewhen your dealing with the person whos trying to sign you up enroll you the response times are misleading as once you are signed up your emails are all but ignored and responses become non existentthere seems to also be a russian theme going on at this joint as the person who enrolled me and was pushy for me to sign up via sending me emails on a daily basis and unsolicited calls to my mobile was russian then i sign up and the online course instructor is also russianodd for an australia based online courses company that uses being an australian based company as a selling point and falsely implying you will get an australian based level of standards and not some offshore course from a philippine call center from my experience the two are the same  however with this company your paying doublehonestly stay as far away from them as you can they charge almost double the price as other company's offering the same courses and claim its because they offer a premium service but all the negative comments i read on their competitors  this company is doing the exact same thing only diffrence is they charge you double for the privilege of dealing with their incompetency and utter dissreagard and unproffessionalismthere is a reason its hard to locate reviews other than on trustpilot for this company and it's not because they are a  star company thats for certian if they were then it wouldn't be hard to locate multiple sourcessites showing these reviews
1,14-11-2019,teachers don't care if the assignments,teachers don't care if the assignments are grammatically confusingincorrect i've studied online through a different college before and this one was overall not an engaging or easy online experiencei had to leave because of a serious family breakdown i was about to have to leave my home completely and find somewhere else to live and had no money and no time to do this course and there was zero empathy i was told over the phone i would get some money back but contact special consideration to see if you can get more when i contacted them i was told i'd be getting nothing back and there's no recollection of the phone call with someone telling me i would get money back poor service all round
4,14-11-2019,really enjoyed the course,really enjoyed the course i had some experience programming already so did not learn a whole lot more about how to write a program however i did pick up alot of other useful knowledge along the way specifically databases testing documentation mobile apps xml it was great to receive feedback from the trainers for every assignment and the encouragement i received kept me interested especially towards the end when i was time poor with work commitmentsif i were to point out negatives i would say that i spent  of my time on documentation for the assignments a more even spread of hands on programmingdocumentation would have been more benificial to mewell worth the commitment
5,14-11-2019,loved the journey,loved the journey there were ups and downs but thats life it was a normal nurses day that was experienced   nothing is going to run smoothly

3,13-11-2019,flexible but unorganised,the college is flexible but unorganised internal communication needs a lot of work course material needs close reviewing and editing understanding in terms of extensions etc and generous in providing them frustrating to contact ss hard to get an issue solved ie sometimes if it's passed around it can get forgotten and no one will get back to you even if they said they will hard to get a straight and consistent answer from ss sometimes the trainers were lovely and very helpful and patient
1,13-11-2019,would have given no stars for review score,would have given no stars but that was not an option quick to take your money tutors are not available when you need them their response time was poor i paid in full and barely started my diploma only completing the intro unit and they refused to give a refund i will definitely be telling my friends and family not to waste their money with this college
1,13-11-2019,no promises kept,no promises kept  no help when needed and when you get to a stage of having to get a placement they are not interested tutors changing all the time and you are not told till you ask why your papers aren't being marked
1,13-11-2019,wouldnt recommend open colleges,wouldnt recommend open colleges at allhappy to take all your money and happy to give nothing in return i worked and paid through my whole course plus extras to have nothing to show for it the communication between oc and students is outrageously ridiculous it takes on hold phone calls and emails to be told sorry we cant help you it looks like you have to start againthanks for wasting my time and moneyim taking this further

3,12-11-2019,course changes affected my course experience,the course was a little outdated the time i had to complete the course was significantly reduced due to the changes so i was rushed to complete the course within the timeframe the grading was inconsistent between trainers overall i am happy that i completed the course but would have liked more time
2,11-11-2019,i am very disappointed in open,i am very disappointed in open colleges probably wouldn't recommend iti was disappointed from about midway of my course they changed the theory to be on reckon one instead of myob after learning half of myob who wants to learn reckon one i picked this course to study myobi also submitted an application to get a credit for a previous study this was back in september and still not finalised the customer support team are slow taking a week to reply to one email whats the point in being an online college if you cant function promptly online i am now currently waiting up to  business days for assignments to be marked even redo submissions i have expressed my disappointment over and over again and nothing ever comes of it no one even replies to my emails they supposedly are giving me  refund lol  weeks ago and still not in my accountsorry but i wont be recommending open colleges
4,11-11-2019,open colleges was a good service especially the helpful assessors,for someone that struggles with online learning i found it to be ok at first  once i connected with my assessors i found it a lot easier and they kept me motivated to keep pushing through even in times of self doubti found the assessors and student services helpful and accommodating especially when i needed extensions etci did find some of the assessment layouts and wording of the questions a little confusing  also the online chathelp feature always seemed to be offlineover all i found it a decent service and i actually recommended it to a friend yesterday when she asked me about the course i had just completed
4,11-11-2019,open colleges worked really well for me,open colleges worked really well for me as i had to work full time as well i couldn't have studied if i could only work part time i'm grateful for this online learning opportunity
5,11-11-2019,best learning journey questions,i widaryati had best learning journey with open colleges the staff were very friendly helpful and communicated extremely well and were responded to my emails and questions very quickly i definitely recommend open colleges to anyone who would like to extend their study thank you so much guys you are all awesome
5,11-11-2019,from signing up to receiving,from signing up to receiving notification id graduated the cert iii in education support course was laid out in an easy to follow way i moved through the course with no qualms there was help whenever i needed it i highly recommend studying through open colleges
5,11-11-2019,amazing place to study,such an amazing place to study the teachers are super supportive and always willing to help you when you do not understand the time spent on campus is used wisely by the teachers to help learn those clinical and critical thinking skills you often don't learn in other forms of learning such an amazing experience with small classes who all work together to help everyone make it through to the end highly recommend
1,09-11-2019,do not use,do not use  they dont give you full information when signing up they have no compassion when you hit hardship and then when you try to reinstate because you decided if you are going to have to give them money anyway you might as well continue they make it even harder making it easier for you to throw in the towel and still pay them money for nothing
1,09-11-2019,do not use this company,do not use this company there is no support there assessors are rude assessments dont make sense and their assessors dont type proper english after paying k  for a course i have been completing over the last few years they have deleted all of my work due to a recent upgrade and expect me to complete all over again my response so far is that they sent me an email in july that email did not explain that topics i had completed would be wiped because one of my recordings was not opening on their end coming up to  weeks now without a response from their complaints team that of course has not contact number  quick to take your money for extensions but terrible when you need helpread these articles they were a few years ago but nothing has changed they have recently updated the course material which is  times better but expect me to redo everything in one month or pay more in extension feesread the article on consumeractionorg training provider open colleges sued for breach of consumer lawor the forums on whirlpool
1,08-11-2019,terrible communication and poor,terrible communication and poor support really unorganised
1,08-11-2019,awful experience,absolutely disgusting service could not complete course due to chronic health issues and not even start course and i did not need any course materials i provided all the info requested like letters from doctors etc and they're still refusing me a full refund even though online in their special consideration tc's it states that a full refund is an option emails go unanswered to  the emails i have received from them are cold unprofessional full of typos and lack any empathy i will be seeking proffesional advice on getting my money back
1,07-11-2019,full of broken promises just so they get paid,i was promised i would learn how to create ads and understand ads on all the social channels this was the only reason i did the course not once did it go into setting up ads of any kind i was extremely angry about it as i feel like i wasted months learning stuff i already knew the course was also awful with references backdated from  years ago the online world evolves rapidly references from  years ago are obsolete the assessments were not detailed enough i never felt confident in doing them as i was lacking resources and when i would ask a question in regards to where to find the info i was told to just make something up i would not recommend this course to anyone
4,06-11-2019,i found the experience with open,i found the experience with open colleges very convenient as i am a busy person with a lot on and unable to find the time to attend a traditional learning institution  i am passionate about studying and learning so that i can advance in my chosen career path and i was able to achieve this with the opportunity given by open colleges  i found the experience very challenging at times which made the journey and the end result even more rewarding
1,06-11-2019,bad bad college money hungry,if i could i would give this money hungry company a  all there interested in is taking your money if you call and tell them that you have a financial situation if they could at least lower the repayments or give you a cheaper payout figure that would be helpful but no they just run straight to the debt collecting agency as soon as you miss a payment they are a bunch of money hungry people and the courses are ridiculous i didn't even start it didn't finished it and i didn't do anything in between  it's a rubbish company no help what so ever
2,05-11-2019,open colleges is a shocker,i couldn't honestly recommend a course by this company as their priority is taking your money not providing you with a quality educational outcome i completed a diploma of social media marketing through sheer determination as it was a complete dog's breakfast training materials that we so disgustingly lacking in information young trainers who are so out of their depth that they instructed students to google don't believe me  check out their webinars on youtube and assessments on topics for which there is not one word in the training materials trainers say they want to help but then do a complete aboutface and turn into little corporate hags toeing the company line of 'i cannot assist you' as soon as they fear you might actually have a case for legitimately getting their money back given its failure to offer a fit for purpose course under consumer law students complained en mass but these complaints were largely ignored and a group complaint to asqa resulted in the college being instructed to update the course  not that this ever happened i implore you to go to tafe or uni to get your qualifications as open colleges is a truly abdominal excuse for a training provider and you really won't be taught anything useful as you will be googling it all at their direction
4,05-11-2019,the interior design and decoration diploma,the interior design and decoration diploma compared to others is much more complete assessors are kind and in the best disposition to help it was a great learning online experiencei feel the program is more for local students than for foreign students due to all the australian standards codes etc we need to read understand and apply in the assessments this is not helpful for foreign students like me each country is different so we must do this kind of research regarding each student countries standards codes policies etcmodule  using cad must be updated too difficult to understand it is incomplete explanations of how to use important commands are missing and it is quite complicated to learn the way it is shown here it must definitely be a prerequisiteregarding sketchup and vray the versions for students are too old they need to be updated too it is almost impossible to learn vray this wayas a student i think i invested too much time studying australian standards codes of practice etc it would have been better to invest that time in learning more about lighting decoration and materialsi think that there must be a space to share our works there are students from all over the world so i find interesting to see what other designers students are doing in australia africa middle east and all over the world
4,05-11-2019,i enjoyed studying with open colleges,i enjoyed studying with open colleges they were professional and helpful on a couple of occasions it took longer than the  business days allowed for marking of assessments which did slow my progress it was a simple process to get my next assessments unlocked via the online chat overall it was enjoyable learning with open colleges
5,04-11-2019,i graduated thank you open colleges,thank you so much for the whole team at open colleges i found the course well structured and had exceeding support from all my trainers thank you also for showing compassion and understanding during my course with an unfortunate and difficult time i experienced and for offering the support and extension to help me graduate i couldnt be more happier i chose to study with you thank you again to the whole team
4,04-11-2019,some assignments are repetitive and,some assignments are repetitive and some questions could be clearer quite hard to work out what is expected in the assignments fantastic lecturer great support
5,04-11-2019,great student help line and valuable,great student help line and valuable feedback from lecturers
3,02-11-2019,support,i felt a bit in supported and the time it takes to get your assessments back was annoying and took ages to get emails backbut at the end of my cert there was one assessor who went above and beyond and helped out so muchso thank you to her
1,01-11-2019,no genuine support throughout course,no genuine support throughout course one particular assessor was totally incompetent cancelled the course without any offer of refunds to people who still had months on their contract
1,01-11-2019,self serving and poor content,firstly the content was atrocious we were doing content in assignments we hadn't even learnt about which was either in the following module only opened if you complete the prior module or not in the modules at allcourse content is made up prior and the oc bid on the cheepest one and you feel that cheep quality as you go throughi was part of a course that was being superseded by the government many of us had anywhere from  to  months cut from the course no extensions and a one year one email warning people had to pay differing amounts australian students from k to k complaints were handled with the same mixed and cofused messaging as we had complained about in the first placethey will do everything in their power to not give you a refund change your course or check in the see if your being motivated to finishi would look elsewhere to be honest
3,01-11-2019,i enjoyed the course and the,i enjoyed the course and the independence of completing it in my own time however long marking times and long waiting for questions to be answered led to a frustrating experience at times i would likely use open colleges again as i enjoyed the freedom in provided in being able to complete it when i am ready
4,31-10-2019,easy service and great way to do things,easy service and great way to do things are your own pace
5,31-10-2019,extremely profesional staff and great,extremely profesional staff and great help
5,30-10-2019,great course excellent resources,i enjoyed my course cert  in electro technology the resources are excellent the the material is presented really well the communication between myself and the teacher is excellent and prompti will be starting another course in the very near future with open collegesthanks very much to the team and well done in creating courses that come with flexibility and luxury of being able to do it in the comfort of your own homewel done kind regardsglenn broderick
1,29-10-2019,a terrible experience,having worked at a pet store for  years i knew a lot of the theory in my cert  i chose open colleges because i could easily complete it and get the qualification for the things i already knew oh how wrong i was a process which should have taken me a few months and maybe some extended time when trying to organise my own placement was stretched over more than a year because of how poorly the open space is organised the lack of communication and very little help from open collegesa change to the course in the first  months meant i had to do more assignments for modules i had already completed this made me feel like all the work i had already done was worth nothing as the new assignments were very similar to what i had already done over a year later when i was waiting for my graduation email from my assessor i get told i have  uncompleted assignments despite the fact i had asked an assessor before the transition if i had completed my gap assessments correctly and they said yes when i looked over everything again i am  positive i did complete everything as i was instructed to but my assignments were still deleted my assessor was sympathetic to my situation and allowed me to extend my course free of charge my course was going to expire in  days when i realised i had  more assignments to do my assessor helped as she could and was honestly the only saving grace of this whole experiencethe open space is terribly organised the information is all over the place and if i have read something somewhere i can't seem to find it again on the communication board students are encouraged to ask questions and yet the only response they get is call student support when i was working out my gap assignments the first time i was told i needed to book a skype call as this was the best way for me to be helped i booked my call for a saturday morning and sat at my laptop waiting for a call which never came i wasn't surprised as this proved to be very typical of open collegesi have studied a bachelors through open universities so i thought this experience would be similar but maybe because my bachelors was through an actual university they are at a much higher standard studying online with them has never been an issueopen colleges has made me want to rip my hair out so many times if i hear anyone say they are thinking of getting a qualification similar to mine or studying online i tell them no matter what never go through open colleges
3,29-10-2019,content was good,content was good support was a bit ordinary
5,29-10-2019,i highly recommend open colleges to anyone considering online study,i highly recommend open colleges to anyone considering studying online i have recommended them to friends two who have already signed up and one more who is just about to join i found the website very easy to use but the best point was the excellent support provided by trainers assessors and student support every time i needed to communicate with any staff from open space i was greeted with very friendly prompt and professional service by phone and email i am very grateful to everyone at open colleges and would definitely chose them again i cannot praise them enough
5,29-10-2019,the whole experience was so worth it,the whole experience was so worth it to look back on what i achieved is incredible i had some very basic knowledge in programming but learning new languages and procedures was amazing well worth doing this course
1,29-10-2019,limited flexibility and support it was more stressful than it needed to be,i chose to study online as i was working full time i thought considering that not being face to face is hard enough that there would be more support available online i often waited days for a reply and despite emails directing me to certain support lines i would constantly get transferred to different teams it took a while to get in contact with the right person before being able to talk about my issue the initial phone numbers or contact given were never correct the course changed mid way through and i was forced to complete additional work this was made completely impossible and many of the assignments were duplicates but still had to be completed which added more unnecessary study time i also missed out on days of placement as my form did not get back to me in time despite giving in to the team with over  weeks notice it came back to me as my student id was wrong but only a few days before my placement was scheduled to start and then no one could help me fast track it this was despite telling the team my sense of urgency as this placement had to be booked about a year in advance i also used a different student id for all past forms which were accepted but all of a sudden i had a new one which was never passed on to me the course was much more stressful than it needed to be purely for the lack of support and flexibility studying online should have more flexibility or better support and process' as students are studying online for a reason
4,28-10-2019,over all i enjoyed it,over all i enjoyed itvery easy to navigate the site helpful online agents and staff to call or  message
4,27-10-2019,was challenging,was challenging but well worth the effort
1,27-10-2019,stay away from open colleges,i would  not recommend studying through open colleges the trainers don't responded to messages never contacted me even though i went out of my way too contact them some of the trainers were very rude not helpful at all and overall are very very petty stay away from open colleges all they want is your money it will cost you  too extend your course every month
4,25-10-2019,room for improvement,open colleges was good to deal with before and well after the whole transition debacle however during the transition period and after it the mess and debacle was extremely stressful open colleges did not do everything they said they would and i had to chase up my trainer to remind them to contact my supervisor for the questions i didnt automatically rollover to graduated status either which was frustrating and disappointing even after calling and the lady said she would roll me over manually she didnt do it i called a week later to check and it hadnt been done
4,25-10-2019,advantages and disadvantages of the training,advantagesthe learning material are designed very wellthe knowledge covered within those study material is goodmost assignments are really good for helping student deepening their understanding of the contentdisadvantagesome links in learning materials are not workingsuggestion incourage students to report the links which are not working
1,25-10-2019,support is terrible,support is terrible content is poor out dated spelling and grammar mistakes can't contact assessors will not recommend and will be telling anyone how bad it is
4,24-10-2019,prac hours slightly excessive,i really enjoyed the theory side of things and my prac was an amazing experience the only thing is that i think that  prac hours is excessive as the other colleges only require  hours the reason i think this is because the course is only a cert iii compared to other colleges that are a cert iv other than that i had an amazing experience and im glad everything is complete
5,24-10-2019,this has been one of the most amazing,this has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life there were times it was hard and stressful even times that i wanted to walk away but i was encouraged to keep going and i made it through i have been lucky to have the most amazing teachers and facilitators  thankyou open colleges
5,24-10-2019,excellent,quick to respond to questions quick to process assignments great trainer
3,24-10-2019,nice staff gives you the three staff,nice staff gives you the three staff unfortunately the company does not regularly check their course material study links did not work and their other mistakes made it hard to focusit took weeks not days for assessments to be markedquestions in the assessments did not make sense or needed more wording to answer accurately
5,24-10-2019,great,it was a really good experience
2,24-10-2019,studying with open colleges has been a,studying with open colleges has been a difficult experience and what makes that experience even harder is trying to deal with the team you have hired and put on your telephones it seems to be not many  people know what is going on whenever i have called to know something or im forever chasing them up because they never get back to you unfortunately if i decide to study further i most likely wouldnt study through open colleges very unhappy customer
1,24-10-2019,unfortunately aarron wasnt very good,unfortunately aarron wasnt very good with a call for me saying that one person should call me back that i had made multiple course enquiries really the client doesn't care who calls us back its about the information you give and about the service you provide i don't think i will be taken any course option here he wasted my phone call and time
4,23-10-2019,i had a good experience with open,i had a good experience with open colleges there was a solid support system there when needed a little disappointed that i only got the previous version of my course new version released this year but overall all good
3,23-10-2019,great experience lovely assessors slightly vague on course content,open colleges offered me a great opportunity to start studying my certificate iv in veterinary nursing without needing to wait on an acceptance list open colleges has gotten me the qualification i wanted while working full time and granting  extensions it has been a great experience with my particular course i wish it covered more i have a job as a veterinary nurse and feel a lot of areas have not been covered in my course student support always take days to reply to my emails and there were no final exams which didn't make me feel challenged or like i was learning adequately as in a school like setting where end of unit exams allowed you to recap everything you learnt this was not the case neither was an end of yearend of certificate exam to allow the recap of everything you have studied so far this made me feel like without the constant need to refer back to study for constant tests or exams i forgot most of what i had learnt the assessors are very lovely and helped everywhere they could
4,23-10-2019,cert  in electrotechnology,overall the course was fine the content was mostly good if a little unorganized often the web links were broken feedback and assignments were marked fairly quickly it's a shame the course is being discontinued also had issue with the college not notifying about the course being in teach out mode  which means you cannot extend the course finishing time i would recommend open colleges only if you are well organised and able to teach yourself well it very much relies on you teaching yourself it was good to be able to do this course fully online some improvements like dedicated videos from an actual australian tafe would have been nice often used usa based recordings overall happy with the course
1,22-10-2019,i was very disappointed with open,i was very disappointed with open colleges
3,20-10-2019,overall a positive experience,overall a positive experience however some course material was not uptodate and sometimes response times from assessors took a little bit longer than anticipated which sometimes held up my studies but they were extremely friendly assessors once they replied
3,20-10-2019,probably need to review the content of,probably need to review the content of the course periodically some of the reference materials and links are out of date or not workingthe assistance from staff is good and prompt
4,20-10-2019,good experience,useful staff who are helpful and willing to get you through the hard parts of your course  the aspect of choosing when and where you can study is the best feature of doing open colleges and recommend it for anyone that wants to travel or cant commit to physical studying
4,20-10-2019,great course and great up to date,great course and great up to date content the only thing i would say is there needs to be deadline commitments for each module to help you better progress
5,18-10-2019,good and timely communication,good and timely communication easy to understand course contents supportive and good teamwork staff
3,18-10-2019,a good syllabus,a good syllabus although at times the platform proved a little slow and clunkysupport was mixed both in terms of knowledge and quality  also slow responses at times
1,18-10-2019,animal studies pathway,open colleges have been a headache to study through from the get go the course transition gap assignments mixed information from student support ongoing problems accessing course information on open space and lack of contact from trainers has made studying extremely difficultthe pathway i am enrolled in and paid for has now been cancelled and the only advice i have been given is to put a complaint form ini have just left my full time job and started a new job at an animal care facility so that it matched up with this study to find out that it isn't going ahead anywayextremely unhappy with the product i have been suppliedi want my fees back as i have not received what i have paid for and i will certainly not be studying with open colleges againor recommend them to anyone
5,17-10-2019,open colleges a pathway to your future,i enrolled with open colleges to change my work journey and create a path into horticulture with the help of the horticulture crew and student support i am now qualified in my position in a gardening team in my local council the feedback along the process of completing cert  in horticulture was invaluable and strengthened the knowledge i was gaining in on the job experiencethe whole team at open colleges are really friendly and helpful and they encourage and develop the tools you need to succeed thank you team
4,17-10-2019,the course is good but the student,the course is good but the student support i found it a bit hard to get it
4,16-10-2019,feedback,would have liked the past webinars to have been recorded and saved on the servers so we could access them at anytime due to some links not working due to the backlog of assessments it could take longer than the  business days to have your assessment marked which is understandably apart from that it was good to be able to study at my own pace questions were answered in a timely manner
4,16-10-2019,great course with a diversity of projects to gather knowledge  experience,i really enjoyed studying the diploma of interior design  decoration the course taught me so much i didn't even know would be entailed for an interior designer i definitely came out of it prepared for a new career and new challenges the course is however a little outdated  some videos are from  years ago and therefore the tutorials on software were no longer relevant and as such i had to seek tutorials externally so to learn new software several links don't work in the reading material so those definitely need to be reviewed the trainers  assessors were always very kind helpful and positive to correspond with they responded professionally and efficiently and always provided great feedback to help me improve
5,16-10-2019,course work was easy to understand and,course work was easy to understand and practical using a great platform
4,16-10-2019,i studied diploma of nursing,i studied diploma of nursing my tutor was amazing very dedicated and experienced the clinical placements i went on were all very valuable and on very acute wards which taught me a lot the payment plans were flexible and the online system enabled me to study anywhere you do need to do a lot of self learning and be willing to put in your best effort
5,15-10-2019,such a great training company to study,such a great training company to study through very helpful staff easy to contact and get a response in a timely fashion would recommend them to anyone
5,15-10-2019,my experience over the  and half years,my experience over the  and half years has been nothing short of a great one  i was always assisted and my enquiries attended to promptly  the assessors and trainers were always very helpful and were pleasant to deal with  it was greatly appreciatedi recommend open colleges to anyone especially those that work full time and need that extra assistance outside of office hours  the flexibility and ease at which this can be done is very goodoverall i am very pleased with having been a student with open colleges  it has been a great journey  thank you
4,15-10-2019,i highly recommend open colleges,my rating is really  stars i recently completed a cert iii in education support through open colleges  i really enjoyed the course and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend open colleges to anyone looking to study i could go on about the things i love about it so i will dot point some of my highlights the website and course content are easy to navigate the learning structure is well set out with menus and easy to understand theory  i particularly love how they include links to videos and other texts to help support you in your learningthe multiple choice quiz at the end of every module is a great way to test your learning before you start the assessments there are no due dates for assignments which makes juggling study and workfamily commitments easythe trainers are helpful and from my experience are very quick in their responsesthere is a wonderful and supportive community of students studying the same course who you can rely upon for assistance and tips when needed toothe only reason open colleges are losing the half point is for the length of time it takes for assessments to be graded  we are told that they are marked within  business dayswhich used to be the case  but lately it has taken much longer than this and can be up to a  weeks laterother than that it has been a fantastic way to study and i would highly recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to pursue their dreams
3,14-10-2019,i would have liked more interaction,i would have liked more interaction with the teachers and a message from time to time checking on how i'm going with the coursei would have liked an email when i finished the course to confirm i had finished it all and saying congratulationsi found most of the modules really informative but some were just a few sentences more information would have been betterover all though i was happy with the course and it was easy to progress through the modules
2,09-03-2020,so terribly disappointing,unfortunately i don't have positive words for open colleges and the  diploma of social media marketing im too embarrassed to put my qualification on my cvfor me the course failed in so many ways to live up to its advertisingit was clunky poorly written and had many many gaps core skills in social media marketing were not taught  simple things that people doing a course at this level expect  like how to set up facebook pages websites blogs training materials contained missing information spelling mistakes poor grammar and information that is just plain wrong the trainers instructed their students to go and google to fill the gaps students were also assessed on things for which there is not one word in the training materialsthere was also no one proactively engaging with students   checking in to see how they are going for some reason the trainers were not even allowed to email students with important information like the date and times of webinars and they were only allowed phone consultations with students as long as it doesn't exceed  minutesasqa has recently reviewed the course too and the outcome was that open colleges now has to change the course and its practicesi am so truly disappointed i was hoping to upskill to return to work after a break raising kids but i can't possibly put this on my cv as it holds no worth im now studying at a post graduate level at uni to try and make up for wasting my time and money on this dinky little open colleges course
2,14-10-2019,terrible no support poor communication shocking attitude from some trainers,i was thoroughly enjoying the course for about the first  months there were  trainers and they were all very helpful and supportive nothing was too much trouble and the communication was great however all this changed when  trainers left and we were left with one who was still helpful but only marked a few of my remaining papers and the other was terrible it took days for her to respond and when she did the answer was usually  i don't know if you can find the paper or info then i cantappointments were made to carry out oneone skype calls and then she mixed up the times and didn't call when arranged or did and then it was immediately obvious she hadn't even read my assignment prior to calling her unhelpful careless attitude came across in communication in the online platformin october  we were given  weeks to submit all remaining assignments for the course by text and email from oc for many students this meant they were only able to finish half the course we were told the course was no longer going to continue and really oc should not of enrolled any new students knowing that the course is  years long the lack of consistent communication clear advice and instructions have left many like myself extremely frustrated and angry i was lucky to of been  weeks away from completing mine when i received the text messagei finished this diploma because i wanted to gain the qualification but i honestly wish i'd spent my money with a different training provider i would never spend money on another open colleges study program again
4,11-10-2019,great,the context and support provided throughout my course was fantastic only then things got a little messy were with my placement catch ups but we sorted those out in the end so happy i completed my course through open colleges
5,11-10-2019,very good online course,very good online course  i was very well assisted by my trainer  assessor fiona every time i needed support i was promptly answered  i am very satisfied
5,11-10-2019,i loved this course,i loved this course it took a lot of pressure off me knowing i was working in my own time and if i needed to deal with unforeseen issues which come up all the time i could put the course on hold for a few days  the support was great when needed   for me personally this was the best way to study
5,11-10-2019,great experience,i had a lot of support throughout my course from the assessors you have to take into consideration that the assessors are marking thousands of peoples work so you have to be understanding when you're waiting up to  days for feedback or to be markedoverall i really enjoyed the course they made it even more engaging by adding in videos etci'll happily go through open colleges again if i decide to study further

5,07-10-2019,the course was great,the course was great but be warned the php assessment is very hard
3,07-10-2019,needed more support,i felt there was too much of a timeline between phone appointments and assignments being marked i had a lot of trouble getting help with finding community experience the last month was the only time i really felt i was getting the support i needed
1,05-10-2019,this company severely lacks integrity,this company severely lacks integrity and they do not give refunds under any circumstances i have studied online a few times and this has been the worst company i have ever dealt with i highly recommend looking at other companies if you are thinking of enrolling in an online course i enrolled in diploma of social media marketing and paid for the full cost of the course upfront within two months of starting i have  major life changes happening at the same time and became highly stressed and unable to study i supplied all the documentation they asked for in order to get a refund and after i supplied very personal documentation they refused my refund not even a partial refund
1,05-10-2019,stay away,they dont even deserve the  star open colleges is by far the worst experience of a course i have ever had the course is literally just copy and paste content almost the entire way through with the exception of a couple of random irrelevant questions here and there the learning content is upto  years old and no longer applies they advertise that you learn all these things that you absolutely do not and you are assessed on things that you arent taught but expected to know that again do not have any relevance to the course open colleges has done nothing but undermine the students that want these issues fixed they solely just want our money  stay far away from this company
1,05-10-2019,very frustrating to deal with,very frustrating to deal with the course i am undertaking is riddled with errors and outdated material support is useless they do not care about the education side of things just a money spinner
1,04-10-2019,i would give zero stars if i could,i would give zero stars if i could do not use this organization poorly written assessments formatting  problems only accepting word docs no pdf files if you have a mac computer a friend did it is not compatible she had even more stress than i did and was told to buy a program to make it easier for them what are you paying for  wait times for marking are long as staff are leaving inconsistent marking grading a competency based course condescendingly told they would explain the difference between competency and tertiary education when i asked for marking key as it was being graded they need to explain it to themselves idits i could keep going but i will just say find another provider don't waste your time or money
2,03-10-2019,just enroll this september,just enroll this september healtcare online communication very poor didn't explain where howdidnt get yet my course materials because of work experience sheet and still need repay my registration that i can't find playsment for my experienceevery  weeks ridiculous and when i ask about help didnt get any answer at allnot recommended
1,03-10-2019,i would think twice about going with,i would think twice about going with open colleges they ignore hour emails extort more money than needed and then do nothing for you the college feels  zero compassion to private situations they just keep extorting money from youzero compassion   they will add a other  onto your bill if you dont pay then threaten to take you to courtthink very seriously they did not care i had a very personal situation as to why i could not start the course but still wanted money think ery long and hard before u go with them
1,25-09-2019,thief's wish i could give a  star,wish i could give a  star disgustingwhat a terrible experience  open colleges is the worst companygroups of people ive ever dealt with  im a mum of  i was dealing with surgery after surgery and they lied dodged emails and pretend phone calls and stole thousands of dollars from me i never even started my course but i paid every week i went through hell to exit the contract and get a reffund which i didnt get a centi hope karma gets them
5,24-09-2019,faith restored,after having a disgusting experience with spoted who i recommend never to go with i was sceptical with trying to study online  how ever open colleges has been nothing but extremely supportive and live upto the expectation i have with a education provider dont fall victim to education scams like spoted use a reputable organisation like open colleges
1,23-09-2019,a pity i couldnt give them a zero,a pity i couldnt give them a zero yes i also believe they write their own reviews they have conned and now sending my daughter financially broke they lie when they write back to you about having read your emails letters etc at no point do you feel as though you are communicating with an education provider more like loan sharks beware stay away pay attention to those who have had their lives changed by debt not education
4,19-09-2019,supportive responsive and oc staff was very helpful,i have graduated from oc few years ago i studied allied health assistance i found that oc was quite good i know that the assessments were a little bit overwhelming especially the video assignment part but in the end all worth it i always reached out the assessor when i found difficulty to finish the assessments and they were very helpful i only waited for  hours the longest time to get the response they were very responsive regarding the placement i found that the last assignments and videos were a little too much i had to do writing assessments presentation and interview over the phone for the very last one before they marked the whole course to grant the certificate the coordination between oc and my work placement were very good they approved my application to do the placement and oc staff did the other paperwork and i started my placement few weeks later as it was during christmas break and new year i didn't wait for months to get approved for my placement i know to find the work placement was not easy after few attempts to apply finally i found one at a special school under ot supervision i finished the course within  months includes  weeks christmas and new year's break over all my experience with open colleges is quite good it is not easy for online study you have to work hard focus and perseverance but the most important  thing is the support from the institution that we need the most thank you oc for your support during my study now i am working in a health sector as a nurse
1,17-09-2019,stars,starsthey write their own reviewsthe assessment instructions do not match the assessors marking criteriai didnt learn anything it was a waste of time the assessors are unhelpful and rudefifteen pages of assessment instructions thirty pages of assessments all to prove i can write an email i receive it back because the point spacing wasnt correct i was told to put the assignment onto a precise amount of pages nowhere did it mention point spacing after going onto the next maze of assessments i had to go back to do the assessment again and guess how to make it on the right amount of pagesall to prove i can write an email
1,16-09-2019,poor support,poor support poor course content subpar teaching staff enormous waste of money save your money and go to an actual uni or tafe i chose open colleges because living rurally i didn't have many options like many others i found employers think nothing of their qualifications it's near impossible to get work experience and their staff turn over constantly
3,15-09-2019,stars poor support lots of workdetail in assessments and pretty average course material,course material is very general and assessments are very detailed large portions of the assessments require you to do your own research to be able to complete them as the information needed is not included in the course material you will need to be able to work independently as assessments are vague and little guidance or direction is given upfront i found this very frustrating at times when you do reach out to assessors response times are slow which can be very inconvenient and interrupt your progress significantly generally the course content was relevant and informative and the assessments were thorough so i developed some good knowledge and skills that i can apply in my role at work however proper and detailed explanation of assessments needs to be provided to students upfront instead of just expecting them to reach out for support when the support options and access to assessors isn't great overall i would rate my experience with open colleges as  stars
5,15-09-2019,leadership and management,i recently finished my diploma of leadership and management i agree it was hard work but completely worth the efforti don't understand a lot of the negative reviews here you're all adults responsible for your own learning don't expect the answers to your assessments to be spoon fed to you like a child you either want to learn  or you just want a 'qualification' without learning a damn thing if being responsible for your own training and meeting assessment deadlines is not for you then do your course in a classroom not onlineif you do want to learn online course create that opportunity they are not meant to be easy they are meant to challenge you make you want to read and research and read some more but if you just want someone to give you an easy pathway to a qualification without actually showing that you learned anything at all then online courses like this are not for youthose of you looking for a 'tick and flick' course without actually using your brains can get those 'qualifications' almost anywhere but really they mean nothing more than the paper they are printed on if you want to actually learn then you need to apply yourself and that takes time and effort which many of you don't seem to want to bother withi want to thank my assessor simon for his support and encouragement to do better his feedback was really helpful and helped target the areas that i need to do more research and improve my knowledgenow i have a diploma that i can proudly know that i genuinely earned without just demanding open colleges do all the work for me
1,15-09-2019,i have had the worst experience with service,i have had the worst experience with open colleges there service team is very rude and their they dont understand simple human decency i had refused to pay the rest of my fee and stop studying with them but they still forcing me to pay the rest of the fees im going through a rough time with money and health at thisstage but they still dont care i have had asked for other options to pay the rest but their process is ring the college and then fill a form out and then they will get back to you in  weeks or so and most of the time they are just wasting your timei would never recommend anyone to go to open colleges
1,13-09-2019,everything about the experience of,everything about the experience of studying with open colleges was horrible lack of communication rude student support advisors and just an absolute nightmare the whole way through my course will never study with opencolleges again
2,13-09-2019,not impressive,not impressivei couldn't recommend open colleges to anyone the course i did diploma of graphic design seems way out of date pointless and bloated with filler tasks that prove to have any use or logic behind them and if you dare to question the course content there's really no help given the trainer might reply to you a few days after your question but the response is pretty much bloated filler too they say they're happy to help but don't really give any help one trainer in particular anywaymy quick version there's some useful parts of the course but the amount of filler tasks is ridiculous this diploma needs an update bad and the further you get into the course the worse it gets the last two assignments are as pointless as you can get
3,12-09-2019,something new,soi have been looking at doing a course on opencolleges for at least  weeks now i keep going back to this website but not actually enrolling in the course i want to enrol i just yet after seeing the reviews i am a little worried is this going to be a waste of timemoneyi already have a qualification as a dental nurse in fact have a diploma in it but really wanted to study something newwould this company be the right thing
5,11-09-2019,i have studied externally in the past,i have studied externally in the past and from my experience open colleges could not be any more helpful any queries i had were dealt with that day i could talk to the trainers and assessors and their resources are up to date i found using the webinar extremely helpful and assisted me in achieving either an distinction or high distinction every time the trainers and assessors were very helpful and understanding they gave me constructive and positive feedback i would definitely recommend open colleges to anyone looking to study on line
3,11-09-2019,flexible study arrangements but too many tutors,having flexibility to study when i wanted or could was one of the reasons for undertaking study through open colleges the support from fellow students was outstanding and one of the reasons i would consider a second course of study throughout the course however i had three different tutors  for a newbie it was a little confusing who was responsible for what  the last tutor we weren't officially notified about or i missed the post just saw her name appear on assessment queries and made the link the standards between the tutors was different as was their time to respond to queries  please set the standards for turnaround times so that we don't expect too much
1,11-09-2019,terrible experience,terrible experience i enrolled in a cert  of interior decoration in  i specifically asked the question when i was thinking of doing the course if the course involved a lot of drawing as this is not one of my strengths  i was told there a little but i would be fine  what a load of bs i could understand the need for so much drawing if i was doing interior design but my course it titled decorationthe correlation between the course notes and the requirement for each assignment is ludicrous  the notes are basic say level   and the demands of each assignment are like level  such a waste of time and moneyps i have just read the review below by teresa who was doing a cert  in web design  her experience is scarily similar to mine they must have the same course structure across all of their coursesdo not waste your money
5,10-09-2019,i found open colleges very good to work,i found open colleges very good to work with and supportive and they were always there to help when i required it
3,10-09-2019,the course was interesting,the course was interesting technical support sometimes was good sometimes was terrible some material was missing quite often instructions in assessments were unclear
2,10-09-2019,this was the worst written course i,this was the worst written course i have ever done it was difficult and needs a lot of work to improve a lot of students have complained about this recently i'm sure you've seen
4,10-09-2019,great learning but you need to be self,great learning but you need to be self motivated to do the learning yourself as you do not get the classroom experience
2,09-09-2019,must have patience to go through open colleges,what was meant to be a month course turned into months unfortunately at the start i was still getting used to 'ownpace' studying meaning there were no set dates assignments had to be submitted so it took some time to get into the groove of studying that way however once i did it just turned into a fight open colleges had a policy on a  workday return on written assessments yet they took on average  working days then they changed their policy to working day return which their assessors still couldn't stick to a lot of their assessment requirements were misleading meaning a lot of written assessments came back to me saying they were wrong and when i asked for clarification i got no response a lot of the questions in the written assessments were not in the study modules and i note down everything so it wasn't like i had missed something so many times all together open colleges was a very difficult company to work with and to top it off i had to get a refund because they took more out of my account then they should have
1,09-09-2019,no support waste of money,i have had nothing but terrible experiences with open colleges many assignment questions do not make sense and support provided from educators is minimal to none it is incredibly difficult to find placement when asking for support regarding placement i was sent an extremely long and difficult form to complete which seems like its main purpose is to deter students open colleges will not assist you with finding placement unless you provide a ridiculous level of evidence and forms regardless i completed all the forms and have still received no support from open colleges regarding placement the placement officer assigned to me has missed two phone appointments and ignores emails this has been a tremendous waste of money i am absolutely disappointed and disgusted with this business
3,09-09-2019,it takes too long  days for the,it takes too long  days for the assessments to be returned for amendments corrections
1,08-09-2019,online learning is supposed to be,online learning is supposed to be flexible and efficient however i found open colleges to be totally incompetent lecturers take weeks to get back to you regarding a simple question or don't respond at all the marking of assessments takes up to  weeks  the online portal doesn't always work and then have to get student support to upload things which adds on extra timefind another service provider your time would be better spent elsewhere with people who value customer service these guys aren't very competent
1,07-09-2019,open colleges was a terrible experience,open colleges was a terrible experience for me i studied my diploma of early childhood education and care and it was an awful experience from start to finish the majority of the teachers in this course are rude and hard to get in contact with it can take upwards of  weeks just to organise a simple phone call with them i have had several incidents where i have commenced an assessment and then they have changed the criteria without making any effort to inform me and then marking my work 'inadmissable' upon me waiting upwards of  weeks to actually get on the phone to someone who can do something which i have to take time off work for they look at my assessment and pass me without so much as a sorry for wasting my time the most frustrating drawnout and rageinducing process i have ever been through on top of this i paid a lot of money for this service and have received zero support throughout the last two years simply told to book in a phone call not at all supportive of people working full time i do not recommend open colleges
4,07-09-2019,studies were good all along but needs,studies were good all along but needs to improve in securing workplacement for students even after they have straggle and fail to get one the college takes really long to secure them workplacement
1,06-09-2019,after waiting weeks for a simple email,after waiting weeks for a simple email response up to  months for assessments to get marked and being blamed by student support for the stretched out course times i can gladly say i will never be using open colleges againvery unprofessional understaffed or at least thats what we are all told and at times just plain rude i would recommend anyone hoping to graduate a  month course in under a year to avoid this college
1,06-09-2019,not a good experience overall,poor response times and inflexible recommend do the course face to face not online   not good value not relative in all areas definitely needs reviewing of course and relationship to the certificate   most support staff on phone wonderful however a few rude experiences including being accused of forgery no apology  email removed however  recommend do your course with an organisation that you can work with the people not online   this course was personal to me due to my elderly father who has advanced dementia  this course is not relative nor assessed well   many many repeats of the same requirements  crazygraduated now however would say not a pleasant learning experience at all and will not do more with open colleges in the future
4,06-09-2019,i'm really proud to have graduated from open colleges,i'm really proud to have graduated from open colleges  digital design it was really hard work and i had a few nervous breakdowns but on the most part staff at open colleges helped me through it as a working mother with twin boys the delivery of the course was great with no pressure to have assessments done by a certain date would recommend open colleges to anyone willing to put it in the effort and be a little patient
1,05-09-2019,terrible college,all these positive reviews are most possibly fake in my opinion oc has someone working on this site whos paid to counter each realistic reviews with four fake reviews it happened on the student board as well  do not waste your money they take your money in advance the first module that youve got access to within the cooling off period is easy as then the modules become more complicated and unnecessarily confusing just study in person
4,05-09-2019,plenty of information available,plenty of information available helpful instructors
1,05-09-2019,very poor student support,very poor student support teachers don't help just take money and they really don't do anything other than marking assesments not recommended at all you don't learn and don't get any hgelp completely money waste
1,05-09-2019,the veterinary student support team are,the veterinary student support team are great your general student support is rubbish theyre rude and unhelpful made me feel i could never finish my coursein  years i never got a follow call to see how i was going no timeline with goals for time management etc just an email to say your course is expiring soon pay more money to extend and for near   not sure what i actually paid for
5,05-09-2019,i have completed  certifications,i have completed  certifications through open colleges the trainer's are very polite and informative on feedback and all criticism is very constructive they want you to succeedwould highly recommend
5,05-09-2019,the course was wonderful and the,the course was wonderful and the support team is lovely
3,04-09-2019,room for improvement,i found quite a few of the modules difficult to negotiate and use an example of this were assessments using a powerpoint presentation which required placement of symbols or icons eg a task requiring setting up classroom furniture often accessing the assessments was fiddly  sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't actually working within documents was also strange  sometimes it was a cut and paste that didn't always work sometimes it was dragging the mouse with perseverance they worked but it could be frustrating and time consuming assessments were not always easily available and obvious  some searching was required to locate and figure out what to do  the assessment helpers etci still do not understand the search function no matter what i typed into search in which screen or module the results were either nil or irrelevantassessments took a long time to be marked this was frustrating and not in accordance with the  day turnaround that is advertisedthere is a lot of reading which of course is to be expected with this type of training however more videos and indeed even videos of some topics being taught in a classroom environment would make the course so much nicer to completei felt the trainersassessors often gave stock standard and unhelpful answers to questions being asked on the forum quite often i would read a response not necessarily to my own question and was still left wonderingon the upside i really appreciated the quick responses i received to my private questions these were answered promptly and i received lovely encouragementi feel the system is a bit clunky and there's a lot of room for improvement  in navigating the space accessing modules and understanding requirements unfortunately i didn't write down examples as i went through the course as it didn't occur to me but i wish i could have so i could provide them now but generally it was just an overall feel that the website felt clunky and not as professional and polished as it should bei think this type of learning is a great concept  ideal for busy people perhaps who are juggling young families and a job etc it does not suit people who are unable to motivate themselves as it requires a lot of discipline to sit at a computer for long periods of time and read
4,04-09-2019,it was a sprint to the finish line,it was a sprint to the finish linei dawdled a bit during the first year of my study then was very stressed at the end trying to complete all tasks if you're not selfmotivated this isn't the course for you if you are however and can commit to a regular study schedule you will do wellthe tutors were generally very helpful justine in particular  excellentthere were some assessments that weren't as valid for me given i didn't want to use this to set up a gd business but to add to my existing toolkit instead of doing business plans i would have preferred to have more design tasks to completei'm so happy that my study is finished for now and i can begin to put my skills to use in my employment and to create my own personal artwork
1,05-09-2019,absolutely disgusting service and,absolutely disgusting service and support i have tried calling emailing facebook messaging left reviews as i was guaranteed support throughout the course i did for  years and i did no receive the slightest bit of support i have been trying to make contact for over  months now and they will not get back to me because i am requesting atleast a part refund and since making these complaints i have started receiving emails of support it's an absolute joke and i will never recommend this company to anybody if you are keen on paying k and then receive no contact or support then this is the company for you from the money they receive your money you will receive nothingedit  are you kidding you respond on here because it is a public forum yet you still do not contact me to resolve my complaints wow angry is an understatement no wonder there is no option to respond to the replies on these reviews
2,04-09-2019,needs updating,the modules didnt make sense half the links didnt work the teachers response time was to slow and they were difficult to deal
5,03-09-2019,star experience,i absolutely loved my open colleges journey modules are clear and easy to use and read assessments are complete and interesting staff members are dedicated and helpful i never waited more than hours to get an assessment back highly recommended open colleges for me it was a real challenge as english isnt my mother tongue but they really made my life easy and now not only i am graduated but thanks to the compulsory work placement i found a full time job in the travel industry enrolling open colleges was my best decision ever  thank you
5,02-09-2019,this was my third qualification,this was my third qualification obtained with open colleges  as always it was wonderful experience with plenty of support along the way
5,01-09-2019,would recommend,staff were always helpful and the course structure was simple and self paced which made it easy to study whilst working full time
3,01-09-2019,when you need help after work or on,when you need help after work or on weekends its difficult to get it quite a bit of the course content or limbs were not available over time i did a notice an improvement  especially with live chat  would be good if we could speak to teachers like that
2,01-09-2019,i didnt have a good experience with open colleges,i didnt have a good experience with open colleges i got stuffed around alot told  thing by student support than told another by an assessor caused me alot of anxiety and stress that was not needed the marking time delay was ridiculous  weeks to get a mark back and sometimes it was just a submission error or nothing at all i am glad i have completed my diploma in early childhood but because of this experience it makes me hesitant to ever study again they arent very professional or well organized
4,31-08-2019,happy with the feedback and extensions,happy with the feedback and extensions from the college professional friendly staff
5,30-08-2019,i have been provided with great,i have been provided with great feedback from my assessment pieces which i have found helpful my assessments have been graded efficiently which i love all round i have had no issuesthe whole experience has been pleasant i am always referring friends to use open colleges as local tafe's are unorganised and unreliable i have  certs and this is my nd diploma now i honestly will not use another learning centre after such a positve experince with open colleges you guys rockone of the best experiences of my life was the acata program in sept  so educating inspiring and life changing the personal development for me has been unreal
5,30-08-2019,tutors were helpful,tutors were helpful course material was thorough and work was marked promptly and lots of feedback was given
3,30-08-2019,my experience with open colleges,my overall experience with open colleges cert  early childhood education has been a positive one unfortunately my last period of studies i had issues with communicating with tutors the long wait for their replies or to get a phone call appointment delayed the completion of my certification and often information were unclear that made the process more stressful i am glad i have graduated
5,30-08-2019,great experience studying with open,great experience studying with open colleges for my business administration certificate iv there are plenty of study tools and support for all assessments and the student portal is very user friendly highly recommend if youre like me working full time and studying part time at your own pace
4,29-08-2019,practical and helpful,i found the course overall really great it was great to learn about the principles of design and how to apply these to graphic design works i found the modules on how to create a website through css really difficult if you've never done this before i'm not sure how much a graphic designer in the real world would really create these from scratch the openforum is a great concept however it would have been helpful if trainers commented more when students ask for feedback i also suggest that when students complete this course they should receive an email of congratulations first before receiving an email to submit feedback overall this course will greatly benefit me throughout my career
3,29-08-2019,assessors of building and construction  excellent,average my seem like a harsh grade and it was only because you didn't have the option of good however this does not reflect on the assessors that put in countless hours assisting and grading our assignments if the mark was for these people alone it would most definitely be 'excellent'course contentinformation was good although some of the links referred to international builders this is where i'd like to see more australian contentthe reason why i marked 'average' was due to the countless broken links the grammatical errors within text and assignments and otherwise poor housekeeping of information a lot of time was time back and forth clarifying these issues informing itstudent services of errors which as you can appreciate was quite time consuming and frustrating to say the least in saying this though it and student services were always quick to reply sometimes with a fix and sometimes noti'm sure though if these were addressed and minimised to even  of what was encountered this would be a very good coursein saying all this though i did enjoy the course and it was great to see that they now able to provide to all states of australia once again thank you to all of the assessors for their time and knowledge they afforded me which included their weekends very much appreciated
2,29-08-2019,poor layout and design of course,the course was repetitive and the fact that so many videos are required is  not needed and  not always able for those who cannot get people to do it the instructions and layout is poorly designednow to see if i can get a job out of it
4,29-08-2019,response times on assessments weren't,response times on assessments weren't great  and you needed to constantly ask for the next module to be opened so you could continue with the course this isn't communicated very wellother than that  i had no issues great course lots of information covered
1,29-08-2019,i noticed this provider had issues from,i noticed this provider had issues from the first week i made a complaint about how the support staff had responded to issues i had raised it was completely ignored sent this information on to the asqa australian skill quality authority who responded with your complaint raises concerns about the organisations lack of student support and the complaints and appeals process they have taken matters further with this provider they get so many bad reviews be warned
5,29-08-2019,excellent support,excellent support the team were awesome supported me through to get my qualification there for me when i was in need
5,28-08-2019,studying with open colleges online has been amazing experience and i highly recommend to anyone who wants to change their direction in life enhance education level and further opportunities,studying with open colleges online has been a convenient way of studying for my diploma of community services whilst working fulltime being a wife and mother  assistance is always available via phone or emailing the assessors  there may be times when you feel its all too hard studying however its so worthwhile  i completed my  weeks work experience through open colleges in fiji its not a holidays its a life changing experience for you something i will also remember always remember there is supportthank you to the team at open colleges
4,28-08-2019,overall good some tweaks to improve experience,the course was overall good some of the assignments were quite tedious and excessively long many questions were repetitive some of the structure of the assessments were difficult to follow and needing to do recordings with volunteers often proved to delay submissions as i was depending on other peoples schedulesanthony weymess was fantastic and gave me great support and awesome feedback which was practical and helpful
4,28-08-2019,i completed youth work with open,i completed youth work with open colleges and i have to say they were very accommodating to my situation with time management would also like to thank ronnie clark  i found him to very professional and understanding and could explain assessments very well

1,27-08-2019,the worst course i have ever done,the worst course i have ever done no online class lectures or anything like that it's just here is the modules go and do it the trainers try but they are having to deal with badly written material
5,10-09-2019,for those who work full time,for those who work full time and are still motivated to obtain a diploma this college is an outstanding choice openspace provides all the resources necessary for success but much of the success also depends on the natural intelligence of the student the dedication to putting in the necessary time and the ability to selflearn in a online environment this is really the best choice to get a diploma in project management and start the route to advance your career for a lowcost distance learning  night school alternative it's not simple like any college but you certainly get what you're putting in the online lectures are easy to see and can be viewed live or recorded and the tasks are not overwhelming

3,26-08-2019,disappointed in the lack of support,i am not going to lie this was the worst experience with online studying i was so disappointed in the lack of support and the fact they take a week at most to get back via email support is shocking i had more help from the girls doing my course through a facebook page the assessments really need to be looked at as half of them were extremely hard to wrap your head around hopefully they will improve a lot of money to pay for a course that you dont get much support
5,23-08-2019,course was easy to follow and the,course was easy to follow and the support was great
4,23-08-2019,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open colleges  all the assessments a hard work but this is expected the only downside is that students have to look for their workplacement them self  which can be a positive learning experience  i was unable to secure my workplacement for myself but the open collages help megreat trainers and assessor
4,23-08-2019,assessment structure,the assessments are well structured and allow for maximum knowledge gain communications with assessor can be difficult sometimes as they take a few days to respond to emails and instructions are sometimes unclear
5,22-08-2019,excellent course with great support,excellent course with great support networks
3,22-08-2019,took way too long for assessors to,took way too long for assessors to reply and to mark assessments once handed in i could almost  guarantee that it would be handed back to me at least once eliana is an excellent trainer and has worked super hard to ensure i graduated
5,21-08-2019,highly recommended,i had a fantastic experience studying with open colleges very supportive assessors and engaging course materials they made it very easy for me to gain my qualification i will highly recommend studying with open colleges
4,21-08-2019,open colleges is great for people who,open colleges is great for people who have to trek to long to a tafe they provide a lot of extra information and always help when you ask all in was a great  years of studying with open colleges
3,21-08-2019,average experience,the start of the course was fine it only took  working days to mark assessments towards the end it took  working days however there was one that took  weeks to mark at one particular timemost assessments were manageable until the end when  work place modules were opened  weeks after my placement and not unlocked before going on my placement and it was made out as though it was my fault that i had not asked for them to be openedoverall experience was average
1,20-08-2019,studying with open collages has been a waste of time,studying with open collages has been nothing but a waste of time and money spending  grand of a certificate ii in agriculture that has gotten me absolutely no where have sent so many emails and tried ringing but no reply they are just simply scammers seriously dont recommend studying with them
4,19-08-2019,great,i have found open colleges great to study with i have just completed my certificate  in disability through them there is always pros and cons to any form of studying be that in a class room or online so i will start with the cons of studying online and end on a positive note waiting for modules to unlock  this was slightly annoying as i had paid for my entire course upfront however wasnt given access to all the modules until i completed a full module this was also an issue with after completing a module the next one would not unlock until after the assessment was marked or i would have to call support to unlock it earlier if i wanted to continue studying while my assessment was marked could understand if i was on a payment plan however considering i paid upfront i would of preferred access to the entire course and modules at once unless i requested otherwise however a positive of this was working one by one through each module was not overwhelming and kept me focussed on the one topic at a time assessments being marked  when i started the course in january  it was a turn around of  business days to have assessments marked on completion of the course the turnaround was over a month on a positive note communication was generally well kept between open colleges and students they would regularly post in the forum advising of the backlog and as why and they had a great online person to chat with who was always very helpful communication between  teacher and myself was not fantastic i had a few questions i was stuck on in an assessment to which i messaged through open colleges and also through email and never got a response on a positive note another teacher was extremely fast and helpful i had messaged enquiring when my last two assessments would be marked as i needed my qualification for a job promotion i was going for and he responded by the end of that day with both assessments marked could not have been happier studying online vs classroom i personally prefer studying in a classroom environment simply because i stay on track committed and the help of the teachers and other students are there all the time and the predictability and reliability of help and finishing the course on time however studying online with open colleges was fantastic as a recently single mum of  young children and working part time shift work it was great not to have the pressure of having to attend classrooms miss out on work or shuffling childcare open colleges was very accommodating there were some technical issues that prevented students from being able to access assessments as the assessment i was trying to access was my last assessment and my course was about to expire they gave me an extra  months free of charge to be able to complete it the absolute highlight of my time studying with open colleges was the opportunity to go to fiji for  weeks and complete my work placement hours over there in the fijian community very reasonably priced living with locals and an experience i will forever be grateful for and will never forget students and teachers were amazing and the work being done over there is inspiring
1,19-08-2019,assessments with grammar and,assessments with grammar and punctuation mistakes and some assessments with incomplete sentences no support available after hours and have to wait  days to get a response to questions trainers for assessments frequently changing and assessments unclear and could be worded much better will not be studying with open colleges again
5,19-08-2019,i had an awesome time learning new,i had an awesome time learning new things great service and communication from the teachers to the young generation always ask yourself what part of the trade are you interested in before you learn it but that's just my opinion i love electricity but not so much repairing carsmaybe i have been in this trade too long either way i am happy because i know life is always perfect thank you very much have a peaceful life everyone
4,19-08-2019,overall good experience  some setbacks,overall this was a good course but i did experience an issue with one of the assessors who didn't give me detailed enough feedback on my assessments caused me to have to submit the same assessment  times before receiving a passing grade overall was a good experience but the  business day waiting period can be frustrating at times
4,18-08-2019,great experience varied service from tutors though,the course was well structured and the assessments covered alot of information i definitely thought some subjects were not as relevant as others or that the assessments went into alot more detail than was needed eg surveying  using a water level to survey land very interesting though not practical for the times we are inthe tutors were helpful particularly jeffrey happlin always quick to answer emails and would even call you to help in saying this i was disappointed in another tutor that wouldn't answer emails waiting for weeksall in all a good experience that suits a fast or slow pace depending on how much time you have would definitely use open colleges again in the future
5,17-08-2019,i found it an amazing experience but,i found it an amazing experience but did at times get confused as i did a business course and they modules contained were assuming you owned a business already if i owned a business  i wouldn't need to do the course because i would have already known what i needed to know so the course itself would have been a waste of time and money keep it for someone who doesn't own a business or operate one but for people who want to ownoperate a business
1,16-08-2019,do not enrol with oc,my daughter was pressured into signing up even though she was only making enquiries she had only just turned  so really wasnt prepared for this type of pressure the cost is phenomenal and the lack of support and punctuality of trainers has made for a difficult time in trying to study the course  she sent an email asking to cancel however she was told she must continue paying which i believe is unethical  she then asked if she could transfer to another course for which they declined  we would never recommend open colleges to anyone this is placing an emotional and financial burden on my daughter and i am seeking legal advice
3,16-08-2019,some good things and some not so good,some good things and some not so good things would i choose them again i'm really not sure

3,14-08-2019,overwhelming,for someone who finds it difficult to write this became a frustrating and overwhelming experience only with the help of sarahjane was i able to complete this she is a lovely and very supportive person and a great assess to oc
1,13-08-2019,would not recommend,i completed a diploma of community services with open colleges recently i would not recommend them to a friendits all very unprofessional and unorganised for a start the course content and assessments have spelling mistakes in themi was waiting to complete my work placement in fiji like i was told i would be able to at the last minute it was cancelled as there werent enough people interested in going at no point was a i told that would be a possibility then once id found my own placement open colleges took months to approve it making both the work placement employer my current employer and myself wait i was sent a training plan of everything i had to complete and a time frame to do so in i adhered to this and worked flat out to complete all the assignments in my placement logbook only to later be told that the training plan didnt matter and was to be ignoredoverall they were very unprofessional extremely slow in getting any support feedback or assignment marking and i definitely did not get my moneys worth

3,12-08-2019,my online learning experience,online learning is not the easiest mode of study it suits people who are highly motivated  and can manage their time effectively  overall i found the experience enjoyable although it wasn't without it's difficultiespersevere and keep in contact with your trainers and you can be successful too
3,12-08-2019,takes  business days to have,takes  business days to have assessments marked  more if you had jana who thankfully has now left so  i would like to say things improved once she had gone but i was at the end of the course by then so can not say i even applied for an extension due to her slowness and lack of professionalism towards this job  when i signed up to this course it was only  days if i had known they were to double the wait time i would of not gone with open colleges michelle and sharon have been an absolute joy however if i had of been working with them and not the snarky rude and extensively late jana i would not of marked the whole college as so low the course work is repetitive and dose not include a first aid course which all employees need to do for this role so why would you not include it being online you rely on their website to be fully functioning which it often is not uploads are slow downloads not always available
3,12-08-2019,a need to update course materials,there were numerous instances where the links to additional learning materials were no longer working additionally some of the course activities had not been updated for some time it is a little disappointing knowing that you paid for certain services and they are not maintained regularly
2,12-08-2019,average experience,i thought the teacher was amazing but thats where it stopped having different intakes at different times on the same course i and other people in the class found it confusing and distracting that people were at different levels i also thought that communication between the college and student while on work placement was very poor also communication after work placement was minimal which made finishing the course take a lot longer then it should have also communication with admin was badly organised regarding payments i personally would not recommend open colleges to anybody in the future
5,12-08-2019,definitely worth it,supportive selfpaced learning with assessors that provide encouragement and valuable insights on topics assessedi would recommend open colleges the course content was challenging up to date and presented in a stimulating mannerone suggestion though  response to emails querying assessment requirements is too slow sometimes waiting up to  days for response
4,10-08-2019,my experience at open colleges was,my experience at open colleges was really good  the trainers are fantastic however i did have many issues trying to upload my files for assessment i changed my phone and computer trying to fix this but it persisted all i did was take a  minute video on a iphone and the only way i could upload it to open colleges was either through sending a usb which took over a month to upload or google play which took over  hours to uploadit should not be such a stress to upload files apart from that i really enjoyed the experience thank you so much deidre and inneke you guys are greatjason
4,10-08-2019,the overall structure and delivery is,the overall structure and delivery is terrific getting help is easy however the information on learning difficulties in particular dyslexia is outdated and not in line with current research and best practice marking takes weeks but the feedback is useful and comprehensive
5,10-08-2019,top notch education,i have not been a student for long but my experience with open  colleges has been fantastic and ive had the necessary support all the way they have been very patient and helpful yes i would recommend them as a top notch institution to study with no regrets from this end
3,07-08-2019,great content and set out but there were too many video presentations,the content was set out really well and i enjoyed the learning side of things i enjoyed the layout of information broken by videos i also liked the diagrams as it helped my understanding of information however there were so many videos and i had many complications uploading my videos having a video link on how to compress videos on different devices would be helpful if not already in place i would have liked to know before the course started that there were so many videos if there were another way of doing these presentation assessments that would be much better even possibly doing a document taking photos of start middle and end of a task instead to minimise the videos also it usually took me a day to upload my videos which is time consuming and could have been spent on completing more content and finishing the course faster
1,07-08-2019,open colleges has been an enormousdisappointment,open colleges has been an enormous disappointment this is my second diploma with them and my first experience was very positive however it appears they have lost their ability to appropriately manage and support their students an absolute shemozzle this time around so unless you like chasing up this college several times to gain any traction for anything dont use them
1,07-08-2019,open colleges are not worth going,open colleges are not worth going throughthey are full of con artists and liars they take money from accounts outside of the agreed schedules and refuse to refund i signed up for open colleges in  four years ago i have had letters from my doctor stating i am unable to study due to working full time and an ongoing psychological injury and they did not want me overwhelmed by adding full time work into the mix since being denied the right to cease study i have had to pay every fortnight the stress from this was also included in my suicide letter because they threatened me with debt collectors after i had been off work for a month with a further psychological injury caused by domestic violence do not go through this company they are a gross representation of a place to studythanks for taking money outside of the agreed schedule not
5,06-08-2019,great collage,great collage always available to help you when needed
1,01-08-2019,very poorly constructed course complete waste of time and money,very poorly constructed course materials limited support have to wait days to receive any guidance on questions typically are forced to wait weeks to receive any feedback on assignments even if it is a  simple rewording of a single question they requested a period of  months no staff were employed to mark assignments  assessments so poorly worded that industry professionals i sought out for assistance could not decipher what they were asking no support with practical placements there have been multiple issues with their technology i will be filing an ombudsman complaint this has been a complete was of time money and stress i will be reenrolling in the same course with a different company after scrolling trough a few pages of the other reviews on this website i can see open colleges have responded more quickly to these reviews than they ever have to course enquires or assessments perhaps if they focused more on providing a good student experience they wouldnt have to worry about managing reviews so much
2,01-08-2019,some course modules not appropriate,the course was pitched too high in many instances  there was little support from markers and availability to discuss matters was limited to certain hours of the day which does not suit when you are running a business  the last module on business management was too difficult  i had to enlist the assistance of a qualified accountant who also had issues with the way the assignment was worded and the expectations of the markers  markers also became sarcastic and unhelpful when more information was requested to assist in learning  online learning is difficult enough without resorting to sarcasm  some assignments had 'excellent and outstanding comprehensive answer on feedback to only get a pass  not a great experience all in all
1,01-08-2019,appalling,appalling i studied certificate iv in disability the course content was riddled with errors the assessments were not well planned contained many errors and took up to  business days to be marked i did my placement with no support even though i contacted the school multiple times desperately asking for my checkpoints to be scheduled i am utterly disgusted and would not recommend it to anyone
4,31-07-2019,great support from assessors,great support from assessors throughoutstudy material is ok can be better and more productive
4,31-07-2019,i found that open colleges was the,i found that open colleges was the right way for me to study i was easily able to access everything through the internet and was able to work full time and be able to study when it suited me and at my own pace i found the trainers and assessors that i worked with throughout my course very helpful and supportive and would definitely recommend studying through open colleges to others
1,31-07-2019,underwhelming to say the least,would not recommendmarking feedback is ridiculously slowcontent is not always relevant to assignment questionsassignment questions are so ambiguous then teacher response is so delayed when you do emailwould never enrol in another course here againplatform through which they deliver content is always malfunctioning and makes it incredibly difficult to complete anything in a timely manner
5,30-07-2019,open colleges  great way to study online,open colleges was the perfect rto for me  being able to study at my own pace whilst working full time was a bonus  the course challenged and motivated me to improve my learning as well as assisting in my current employment  open space was easy to navigate and as well as communicating with student support and assessors  i found the webinars informative and helpful when preparing for assessments  i also appreciated receiving credits towards my tuition for subjects that i received rpl for  online learning is not for everyone however i found it to be the right choice for my needs  i would recommend open colleges and would use them again for any future learning needs
5,30-07-2019,i strongly recommend the certificate ii,i strongly recommend the certificate ii in electrotechnology from open colleges i had excellent support during all my study period and every time i need help to solve any issue i had someone promptly to help me they put the student's interest in the first place the study platform is very simple to use the study material is very completed and the professor support is excellent

5,29-07-2019,open colleges have been great to work,open colleges have been great to work with there is always someone there to help you instantly with any problems that may occur i would definately study with them again
3,27-07-2019,education assistants course,i found the process of opening new subjects very arduous you have to email to get a course opened i think there should be a tab in the website that could make it an easier process  staff left during my course time frame and didn't seem to be replaced which meant that it took more than  days to get results back for most examinations the content that you spent a lot of time reading through could be broken down into more memorable subjects and could be addressed better in some of the assessments i feel over qualified for what i am applying for in theory but without the practical side of the course its hard to get a job the practical part of the course could be spread out from the beginning of the course and it would have been better to do it at more than one location i felt like i was limited in my experiences in the one class room for  hoursoverall i found the course easy to flow through sometimes i missed assessments not sure how but it is quite difficult to track your assessments as they are graded and mixed up in the grades pagewhen i spoke with the trainers they were always very helpful and happy to help in anyway they could
1,27-07-2019,open colleges such a frustrating experience,to frame my review i will mention first that i have a masters degree in another field  i say this because it's easy to dismiss a review and say to yourself that this person must not be very smart if she couldn't figure this out  i'm pretty smart and i was quite disappointed with this whole process  i was enrolled in a program and i was unaware they were not done planning the coursework  i was told i could finish at my own pace but then they had not finished the course so in fact i had to wait on the release  i kept thinking i was done with the certificate since i'd finished all the assignments i could access and they just kept releasing new assignments  i also had issues getting things approved for my workplace hours  the process was not streamlined on their end and you have to wait  business days for most things  i found that on the th day they would tell me something i needed to do  i'd do it and then have to wait  more business days for the next step  very frustrating when you are trying to do things efficiently  i was told incorrectunclear information by their office and it added even more time on  i had issues with some assessments because they include openended questions  well when you ask an openended question you need to expect a range of answers that could be considered correct  i found that i could answer questions correctly and because it was not exactly what they wanted i was marked unsatisfactory  for example i was marked unsatisfactory when i wrote that an aboriginal man who was released from jail and settled in a new city would experience a financial challenge when it comes to health and leisure  everyone has financial barriers and limits  this was apparently not an acceptable answer even though it is true  this was an incredibly frustrating process and i am soooo glad i am finally finished  i will never go through open colleges again
5,26-07-2019,happy graduate,all of the staff members were so helpful with anything i needed in my certificate iii business administration and the openspace was so easy to navigate so it wasnt stressful at all and it was great to know that you could have study buddies as well
4,25-07-2019,course material backdated,some of the course material is backdated and doesn't fully comply with the laws and regulations for today and many calculations in the course material isn't efficient or correctsome of the assessments are also lagging proper explanationthe assessors were pretty efficient in marking of the assessments and calling you for tutoringover all the course was ok
2,25-07-2019,open colleges,open colleges' online learning system for the course i completed had not been updated in years reference links were broken references themselves were outofdate in this current age learning materials should be the most recent available secondly workload was excessive for a certificate iii having completed a bschons and grad dip i should know this may be because it was fully online but there are better ways to test knowledge than repetitive timeconsuming busy work time taken to mark assignments was average ability to book phone calls with tutors was difficult due to them being fully booked a month in advancego elsewhere

3,23-07-2019,great learning materials,great learning materials lacks support and timing for getting assignments marked in a timely manner many of the study links dont work needs a strong review
2,23-07-2019,not very helpful at all,not very helpful at allafter signing you up taking your money and showing you how to use the portal you never hear from the trainers or anyone again no one calls or emails you to ask how your going if you need help when you do call or email for help maybe an email will come back a few days later a call will end up in a queue of people then have to state all your details then wait for a call back sometimes you can't even get through the line at allthe course material is difficult in itself and they require videos of you performing tasks it's very embarrassingthere is no help finding work experience unless you have tried  places and failed which then have to fill out a huge protocol of items in order for them to even help you no one comes to your work placement to watch you it's just a phone call assessment which i found quite unprofessionalit's really been an exhausting experience oh and if you don't finish in time they want to charge you more can you believe thati would not recommend this company to my worst enemy

1,18-07-2019,not very helpful,when you ring to get help from student support i was told they couldnt help as it was not course related and i would have to contact my assessor by email only problem with that is i wanted help then and there not the next day or when ever they got back to you  student support were very good with what information they could give up then when it can to my work placement well what a joke thank goodness that my workplace supervisor was so patient there was far to many videos to be done my time and my supervisors time was taken up with role playing instead of watching my supervisor work or getting hands on experience  then there was the check point interview where i was made to feel like a fool
3,18-07-2019,my review,some of the wording in assessments was really confusing and sometimes covered topics we had not studied yet or just worded poorly personally i work better brainstorming with people so that would have been better for me  wish there was more of a student group chat to talk to other students not just the message board wish that assessment marking was done in a faster manner but things are constantly improving
5,17-07-2019,this was a tremendous course,this was an absolutely tremendous course i gain more than i expected it was help to broaden my horizon about the reality and fact of the workplace in everyday task and responsibilitiesi never know that i will be able to complete the course because my first time doing an online course i was benefit in so many ways but most of all that i was still able complete it even though i was tempted to quit the course so many times so thank you to the mentor who accompanied me in coming towards the end of the course when i felt the pressure and stressed so thank you to all the trainers and assessors for the help and support also the student support team for mentoring me on the journeythe only thing that would like to recommend is that module  and how it set up it is very confusing and not well set up specifically the templates to questions very confusing all those templates but above all  this course was an asset for my future career and role in the workplace
5,17-07-2019,thank open colleges mentors,open colleges is good for you to work and study at the same time and get your certificate
3,17-07-2019,overall just a simple course to get,overall just a simple course to get your degree fast challenging in minor areas but you do have to take into account most people are starting with no background if you have been in the industry for about  to  months then you should have no problem knocking this out in  months with rpl and credit extensions minor frustration throughout the course but you can read some other reviews to hear about those
3,16-07-2019,some of the course material was a,some of the course material was a little hard to understand lots of typos especcially in calculation of figures this made some modules harder than they should have been  having said that the assistance from staff was very good
4,16-07-2019,the course was good and i enjoyed it,the course was good and i enjoyed it sometimes the assignments were frustrating as they were written in a way that made you pull your hair out and were not overly clear however all in all the course was good the tutors were great and support were very supportive
4,15-07-2019,recommend a study buddy,recommend a study buddy google will be your best friend ring student support if no answer from trainers thanks
4,14-07-2019,great overall experience,great overall experiencearea to improve is the respond time to grade assignment or process work placement approval process is a bit long since the course has deadline and the delay of your feedback cost more to student due to the extension fee payment is imposed regardless of the reason of delayi understand that assessors or admin staffs may need quality time to do their job right they are all very helpful during my course and i really appreciated their workif the delay payment system is smart enough it would be nice to filter out the waiting time by student and not applying delay fee in those circumstances
2,14-07-2019,i recommend doing this through an,i recommend doing this through an actual tafe course and not online takes a very long time to get a response if you dont answer a question properly i found the course also very hard if you work in the field as it is designed for people who have no experience
1,14-07-2019,having to start my course and then,having to start my course and then  months in when i'm more then  quarters of the way threw having to do gap assements when i could have just delayed my study so i didn't have to repeat modules not clarifying what documents are needed for work experience  having a case manager would help with this so someone who can tell you if you do or do not have the right documents in
4,12-07-2019,overall good experience,i overall enjoyed my course with open colleges the assessors and trainers were very helpful friendly and knowledgeablewhat i appreciated the most was the flexibility that came with the course i was able to study whenever i had spare time and could take time off when i needed tothe only aspect that could be improved is updating course materials such as links to websites a number were expired and it took time to research new sources to complete assessments
5,12-07-2019,open colleges have been amazing,open colleges have been amazing i faced many personal challenges throughout my study and open colleges helped me through they were very understanding and in the end i finally completed my diploma i completed my work experience as part of my diploma in community services in fiji it was such an amazing experience and all organised by open colleges i would never have had the opportunity to participate in such an experience open colleges ran a counselling workshop and i thought it was one of the best workshops i ever participated in i only wish i had the chance to do some moreoverall i cant thank oc enough for the experience it was a long road but thanks to oc i have completed my diplomarosan travis and karen are all amazing

5,07-07-2019,great to study online,it was great experience for me to study with open college teachers and admin staff was very helpfull and supportive
3,07-07-2019,study online again using open collegesprobably not,it was definitely not what i was expecting they take a long time to mark your assessments they have  business days to complete it and most usually take longer when you have  assessments that takes up a lot of your time waiting for that and they really aren't that helpful when you are stuck they just send you back to what you've already read and tell you to read again i learnt a lot from this and patience was probably the biggest thing and a lot of the assessments don't make sense you can't read it as a whole you need to do it one question by one question
3,05-07-2019,technologies based learning,being technologies based learning there will be times when tech will fail us it may not be oc fault but when it really takes time to rectify any problems its at the expense of the students
4,05-07-2019,having studied with open colleges for,having studied with open colleges for the past  years i have found the experience to be an extremely positive one studying online can often be tricky however student support  the assessors were always there to help  no question was ever to big or small to answer i always felt the feedback i received from my assessments was thorough  guiding  if i ever had questions the teachers were always happy to help studying online takes discipline however i enjoyed being part of the online community speaking to student support via the chat function  having direct email access to my teachers i felt i learnt a lot throughout my course  i would definitely study with open colleges again no questions asked

1,30-12-2022,an extremely disappointing and,an extremely disappointing and frustrating learning experience with open collegescourse materials were littered with typos out of date web links and incorrectly numbered documents much of my knowledge was obtained by researching online as the content provided was not substantial to correctly answer the assessments  i finished all course requirements within the  month timeline however due to open college's ability to provide available and competent assessors they continually marked my work as unsatisfactory  justified with offensively absurd excuses  to try and delay my completion for  months i was harrassed to pay extension fees whilst i struggled to get a response to a multitude of emails begging for support or even a timely response  timely communication from the majority of staff was absolutely appalling and i had to threaten formal complaint via teqsa to get any action  please carefully consider spending your money and your time with this rto they are substandard  they grab your money upfront then hang you out to dry  be warned
4,03-07-2019,good teaching,it was a great learning experience the trainor ensures that we are equipped with knowledge and skills needed in giving high quality care
5,02-07-2019,i had a good experience for the most,i had a good experience for the most part however i got let down in the placement department  pretty much got left to my own devices and struggled to get in somewhere and missed out on lost wages from  my job as process took so longthe wait time for marking assessments needs to improve dramatically great feedback handed back to mefelt let down at times when requiring support  not that i needed muchoverally good after some hiccups i finally graduatedthanx open colleges
4,30-06-2019,project management diploma,the assessor and and technical staff are very responsive the curriculum of the course was designed comprehensively
5,29-06-2019,excellent support,i received excellent support from the team when help was neededhighly recommended to study with
5,28-06-2019,great learning experience,my course was great
4,27-06-2019,flexibility was the key,flexibility was the keyi found open colleges very good because i could studied when i could i wasn't restricted to having to hand in assignments by certain dates and if i could i was allowed to submit assignments consecutivelymy only issue was with a couple of my subjects when i went to work placement they said they actually didn't use the information in the industry that we were being taught which made it a little hard to show evidenceapart from that though open colleges were great tanya my assessor was amazing and i would recommend them to anyone looking to further their educations or interests
5,26-06-2019,i had a great experience,i had a great experience my supervisor answered any questions i had promptly and i recieved my grades in a good time
4,26-06-2019,great experience,well put together information with challenging and thought provoking assessments flexible online study always helpful support when needed excellent addition of a work placement to try out new skillsi would definitely recommend open colleges
4,26-06-2019,was a great experience learning online,was a great experience learning online easy to find modules quick feedback and friendly staff would study again through open colleges
5,25-06-2019,learning through open colleges,learning through open colleges has definitely been a positive experience for me the trainers and assessors have always been helpful friendly and readily available toanswer any questions if needed the course has been designed in a very user friendly way so that you are left in no doubt of the expectations and requirements of each module the online student support chat facility makes everything easier as you get instant answers to the more minor questions that you sometimes need answering i would definitely recommend open colleges to friends and family and in fact already have as one of my colleagues has recently enrolled on the same course as myself
3,25-06-2019,while very convenient to do the course,while very convenient to do the course online i personally struggled with not having deadlines or someone encouraging work to be handed in in a timely manner just something to think about before you decide to opt for the online course over a more personal in person course
1,25-06-2019,dont use this college if youre in a rush,it can take weeks or months to mark assignments when you think youre finished youll find out there is more to do it is hard to get information out of these people course material and assignments are very repetitive instead of taking of marks for your assignment they will make you resubmit for the tiniest thing
4,24-06-2019,thanks for your support open colleges,study online was the best option for me juggling a fulltime jobthere was always someone available if i had any questions regarding the course material or if i needed technical supportthere was a bit of a hickup regarding the start of my placement but this was again immediately rectifiedthanks for your support open collegesann lyle
2,24-06-2019,seems more motivated by money than,seems more motivated by money than learning tbh i wouldn't go through open colleges again
5,21-06-2019,good course,my experience was excellent  however my friend did face to face at tafe st george and she learnt nothing i found some if the tasks repetitive  but overall i learnt a lot
5,21-06-2019,i really enjoyed studying through open,i really enjoyed studying through open colleges
5,20-06-2019,very helpful and supportive,i found the staff to be helpful throughout the course and if i needed help it was easy to email or call for help
5,20-06-2019,great for online study,i have studied with open colleges twice now and both times have been a great experience
4,19-06-2019,they were always contactable by phone,they were always contactable by phone and very helpful there weren't many issues with the software the trainers were knowledgeable sometimes it took a while for things to get marked sometimes it was very quick
5,19-06-2019,i think they are definitely worth it  should not be overlooked as a way of getting qualified for your chosen field,i think they are definitely worth it  great value they offered me a lot of learning  opportunities with an online format which suited my requirements for an affordable price with a lot of information on offer the application of finding your own work placement  writing your own applications was of value  coordinating the assessment of this was good great friendly  experienced teami think there is room for people to have lots of problems  dramas with the online platform but if you put a bit of work into getting the experience you need so you are not biased against for studying this way not in a classroom then you should be fine the more you can put into it the better it will be
5,18-06-2019,with open colleges i was able to get my diploma and maintain my life,i would like to thank my trainers and assessors at open colleges i found the learning platform easy to navigate and the information available was informative i also found that with this online learning i was able to study and maintain a life i work full time and this meant i was able to complete my work at night and on weekends which is the only way this would work for meany questions i asked were answered quickly and the assessors  trainers were thorough the only roadblocks i found were my own time management and motivations
2,18-06-2019,very poor service support team knows,very poor service support team knows nothing cant help with anything  not enough materials provided to us the assessor is really nice and helpful but takes ages to get back to us or mark an assessment and all of that is time consuming i enrolled in this course because i work and dont have much time so thought its a good idea to study online but it wasnt the case few times took the day off to study got stuck with something called support team they did nothing and said ask the assessor even though it wasnt an academic question and i told them the assessor will take at least a week to get back to me and i took the day off to finish the assessments and they did nothing very very upset not good experience at all
4,17-06-2019,the flexibility of selfpaced study,it was really great to be able to study at my own pace with open colleges which allows you to completely pace your own study schedule without any set deadlinesthe format of learning was straightforward and expectations clearly defined it was easy to get in touch with support personnel when required and a response was usually not far awaythe course that i chose went hand in hand with practical workplace experience and suited my job role well i don't know if i would have found this course as constructive if it didn't apply to every day work lifethe turnaround time for receiving feedback on assessments was great up until the last module usually i'd receive feedback within one or two business days however with the last assessment it took a lot longer over a month due to the lack of an assessor to grade my work this experience whilst disappointing has not discouraged me from studying with open colleges again and i likely will the pros outweigh the cons by farmy advice to anyone wanting to study is to leave procrastination station as soon as you arrive and get it done
4,16-06-2019,gotta love a study,open colleges supplied fairly good training in the beginning some information was a bit difficult to come by and it was a bit tricky getting hold of the right people to get other information from but i ended up with a new assessor who was absolutely brilliant it made the experience so much easier just being able to be pointed straight to someone who was so eager to pass on his knowledge i would recommend open colleges to anyone keen for flexible learning
1,13-06-2019,think twice before you enroll,very poor student support  working hours to get back with answers from student support cant contact them directly  messages go to voicemail working days to mark an assessment  seems like not enough qualified trainersassesors and too many students to memodules dont unlock automatically after submitting assessments as promised in student materials you have to beg your assessor to do that for you  and of course theyre not available  so you can get stuck nights weekends public holidays ectwork placement is a disaster very poor structure planning and even if you find yourself suitable workplace you have to wait for approval again  working days the workplace supervisors cant contact student support directly either wishes circle of waiting and everyone is pretty fed up my work placement approving supervisor went on a month long holiday while i was in process of approval and she didnt let me know nor contacted my newtobe work place supervisor i lost a whole month of practical work not to mention my new workplace supervisor lost interest in training me because she was eventually fed up with the whole process and neglecti have finally finished my course but i wont be recommending open colleges to anyonei reckon its a great business charging people for online student material and not spending enough money on required amount of trained staff assesors and supervisorjust my view
5,12-06-2019,easy and supportive network,easy and supportive network i would recommend to anyone that is doing this while working aswell for the ease and flexibility although dont treat this like an online course where possible as you can find yourself sidetracked
5,12-06-2019,great experience,i was a full time mum when i started my journey with opencolleges what i loved best was that i managed my own time the flexibility was a great bonus i would not have gained my certificate without opencolleges now i am working in the industry that i have always wanted opencolleges helped me reach this dream role great experience for me
5,12-06-2019,my experience studying certificate iii,my experience studying certificate iii in education support through open colleges has been wonderfulthe trainers and assessors were always happy to answer any of my questions or concernsit had been quite a while since i last studied then to study online and to be motivated was abit daunting however the team at open colleges certainly looked after me and made my overall experience with returning to study online a wonderful onethank you to all the staff at open colleges
4,11-06-2019,open colleges has a easy to use system,open colleges has a easy to use system the professors and other staff have been extremely positive and helpful they helped accommodate me around challenges and complications and supported me right through
3,11-06-2019,course needs improving,access and staff were excellent the website easy to use the course itself was poorly written with many grammatical errors and parts just not making sense to the point i had to request clarification from the assessor this was quite frustrating
5,11-06-2019,great course,great course supportive trainers practical learning content   prepares you for the industry and further training
5,09-06-2019,diploma of community services,diploma of community services great learning experience trainers and assessors were very helpful and gave the help i needed
5,09-06-2019,i would definitely recommend open,i would definitely recommend open colleges they are definitely generous in their support and feedbackmy only criticism is the length of time is takes for marking however i dont think that will be ongoing my impression is that they are going through either a period of change perhaps with staffing or reinventing their practices im certain it will pick up overall i am happy with the delivery of their training the options for payment and the variety of courses they offer definitely makes it easier for a work life balance especially working full time and raising a family
1,08-06-2019,disability certificate,i started my disability course with open colleges in  and i had no help from the start course content was of no use and all mixed up i would contact for support and did not receive a response for  months twice which alternatively put me behind in studies and therefore could not complete it in time but open colleges still demanded their money even though all that was supplied was study materialmy results wouldnt come back for  weeks at a time aswelli suggest never doing a course online and always doing it face to face this review is legitimate this company is not worth the money youre better off at tafe nsw
4,07-06-2019,i just completed a certificate iv in,i just completed a certificate iv in photography and photo imaging with open colleges i took longer than i had planned to complete the course and was so grateful to oc assistance to extend my course it was hard going back to study and having to juggle family my health work and studies this course was more than i had imagined it not only set tasks to learn photography skills but also how to set up a business as i was just starting my own business it was such a great additionit is not a teach you take photographs az course on the basis that you have an existing knowledge base it teaches you build on this to find your own genre and strengths to set you up as a successful photographer at times it was very challenging and i spent hours doing research and setting up shoots you get out of this course what you put into iton the negative side some of the course assessments were hard to follow and not having a class with a tutor it was at times confusing to know what to ask from the questions which were a bit ambiguous i spent a long time trying to figure things out but the help was there when i needed itimprovements  knowing where to post work for successful feedback would be great and more information upfront about things like the facebook page would be goodother than that i highly recommend the course to people who want to hone their exisiting skills and set up a photography business with an added qualification
5,06-06-2019,an amazing experience,studying photography with open colleges was one of the best things ive done i have told everyone how good it wasthe tutors were wonderful they were encouraging and help to take me to a level i didnt think i could do i couldnt fault themmy peers on the facebook page were amazing it was like we really came to know each other and the encouragement and inspiration  from them was a highlight of the course it was a real communityi never felt alone during the course and i learnt so much i am sorry to come to the end
4,05-06-2019,open colleges review,great way for me to study a course that isnt easily accessible in perth helpful staff and easy to use website and useful information although the course update was quite frustrating and threw me off track quite a few timeswould definitely recommend to anyone wanting to study animal studies online
1,04-06-2019,the graders gave little feedback on all,the graders gave little feedback on all assessments and expected everything to be perfect so many times i had to redo work and could add in a few extra words and they come back with a hd gradethey stuffed me around for quite some time with their grading taking months to grad work an extension was granted but hardly covered the delay they placed on my courseoverall i would never tell anyone to sign up for a course with open college's
1,04-06-2019,typical online bs college offering,typical online bs college offering terrible support great scam
1,03-06-2019,very disappointed,i was very excited to start my beauty diploma  but after the nd module problems started to come upthe ammount of assestments to do is ridiculous workplacement are incredibly  long and viasual diary so hard to perform when they ask you to use old fashion machine impossible to find in any salon anymore workplacemnt are sooooo hard to it exspecially when your supervisor has to do as much work as you  filling over  pages and writing comments  visual diaries are incredibly loooooooong and find so many people to perform the treatment is very challenging  i would never enrol with them anymore  learning material is pretty cheap and some of the learning video are taken from youtubestudy material is very very old treatment are old  video are old  i wish there is a way to get my money back and study somewherelse
1,03-06-2019,i should have known better,not the course that it was really advertised to be
3,03-06-2019,dip  adv dip of accounting,i completed the dip  adv dip with open collegesfor subjects such a these i really feel the content is not up to scratch i have worked in the field for  years and the entirety of my studies with open the content seemed lacking was wrong in a lot of situations factually incorrect with regard to the way it forces you to make assumptions with little to no data on hand when dealing with accounting this results in a very drastic spectrum of possible answers however because of my background in the field perhaps i was over complicating the subject matte due to real world experiencesi do need to honestly thank and commend the assesors one in particular being ruchi makkar she was always on hand for my queries no questions asked she helped me through a tough patch where i was strongly doubting completion of the diplomas if you are lucky enough to have ruchi support you in any way you will get through it
4,01-06-2019,open colleges has been great,open colleges has been great  their software has some glitches which is a bit frustrating but calling them and talking to one of their team about what you need is always beneficial  the team are there to help and they know what they are doing  some of the links that they use are not working and need to be reviewedon a side note sometimes there is a wait to get assessments back which can annoying at times but also understandablei would highly recommend open colleges  they are helpful their information apart from a few broken links is up to date and easy to  understand
5,31-05-2019,open colleges certificate iv of veterinary nursing,assessors and student support are extremely helpful
1,31-05-2019,when i first signed up,when i first signed up i had one phone call from my assessor giving me an outline of what the course would entail this phone conversation was the only guidance i received throughout my  years studying with them the only time i heard from open colleges is when they sent an email out asking me to complete a survey and i could win an ipadwhen i completed my final portfolio it took  months to get a response saying that they were going to extend my course by another  months in order to give them enough time to mark everything  months and  week later i got a response from someone who i had never been dealing with why because my original assessor had left the company and the only reason i found this out was going onto the online portal and noticing that the email was no longer active who knows when the person left as none of my emails were ever responded todo not even think about going with open collegesyes they are online and it is a good option when you work full time but the lack of communication is extremely off putting take your money else where
5,31-05-2019,my experience,the great thing about my experience was the flexibility in the time to complete the course and the projects i was able to complete the course while working full time and raising a young family also the trainers and assessors were very helpful as well as the student support team
5,30-05-2019,the experience was great,i found open colleges was very helpful and understanding they are honest and friendly when assessing this was my first time studying online and i think it could go quickly if you manage your time dedicate some time to specifically be studying and doing assessmentsi think the only thing that you miss out on is the hands on help and when you're learning it's always good to learn around people with experience because they are able to teach you nifty tricks and give you extra information but if that's not possible when you're studying online i think
4,30-05-2019,recommended,i enjoyed doing my certificate through open colleges student support was very helpful my only negative would be the waiting times for grading assessments
3,30-05-2019,a little disappointing,in my opinion cert iii health services assistance course did not need to be so long as there was a lot of repetition in the content  in hindsight i would not have completed an online course  assignments take a long time to be marked and workplace approval form was very frustrating to get approved
1,30-05-2019,offering to teach without providing placement,offering to teach without providing placement is not teachingit took me more than  months to find a place to do the placementin other schools i can finish all my duty in  monthsi am very disappointed though the process of learning was good the part of waisting time to find the placement was terriblethis makes all my learning experience bad
5,29-05-2019,student support,student supporti found the student support services extremely helpful throughout my studies i needed a few extensions due to being unwell and having some personal issues they were very prompt with emails which made my time a lot easierthe online quizzes and navigating around the intranetmoodle was very easyteachers were helpful and wanted students to achieveall round a good experience
5,29-05-2019,use the support,corespondents courses i have discovered are hard workoc staff in the civ photography course are encouraging and helpful professionalsthis felt like a full time course if you wanted to finish in the  months allocated  or i just could have been busy with too many other things
2,28-05-2019,disability cert  review,i found it awfully hard to complete my studies as i can count on one hand the amount of times that my teacher answered my calls or emails i found the content good very helpful for my workforce but i was really disappointed with sanet and her level of assistance during the whole course and accountability the other staff that i spoke to for assistance and extensions due to not being able to get help from my teacher i found them all very apologetic and helpful even thought they werent familiar with the disability content they were all rest and i give them all credit for dealing with me whilst i was frantic and stressed
5,28-05-2019,i would definitely recommend open,i would definitely recommend open colleges for me it was very convenient to do a course online at my own pacethe materials were easy to understand however in some assessments i would have loved to have webinars for a better understandingthe trainers and assessors were very helpfull especially rosalie she always respond to my questions very quickly and was very knowledgeablealso the call centeradministration department were very helpfull and friendly
5,28-05-2019,great experience from the begging of,great experience from the begging of the course diploma in community services until the end of great student support and guidance from the trainersenjoyed my course all the way and will recommend to anyone thinking to do online studies to do it through open colleges thank you all
4,27-05-2019,diploma in social media management,i enjoyed the diploma course on social media marketing being a foreign student i was able to complete it in my own time and pay monthly as i progressed really good value for money and well worth it

2,27-05-2019,not happy with the customer service and,not happy with the customer service and overall process customer service is good when you actually enrol for the course but it get worst by the time you finish your studies calling to toll free number is also big task and call never got conacted to right person at very first stage sent few emails but bad luck no reply on my emails too
1,26-05-2019,i will not be enrolling with open colleges,i will not be enrolling with open colleges i was considering the financial options after speaking with an education consultant and because he kept emailing me to make a decision i told him he can close the enquiry then a week later sends an email full of attitude due to my lack of response i was going to choose open colleges but this email made me read these other reviews and i will definitely not be enrolling with you now your first point of contacts with potential and existing clients can be your success or your failure good luck
3,26-05-2019,i found the portal very problematic,i found the portal very problematic wouldn't open modules didn't save work properly not easy to email or navigatei found the content to be hit and miss and poorly written the 'quiz' questions are by far more in depth than just a quizthe assignment questions in some instances were not clear the formatting of answering the long questions was terrible i did not find this course much fun at all
3,25-05-2019,not the best year and a half of my,not the best year and a half of my life
3,24-05-2019,overall my experience with open collage,overall my experience with open collage was satisfactory  there were few times that my assignment took longer period of time to get graded as a result i had to extend my course durations  times which they did free of charge but waiting was really difficultsupport service did a great job with prompt assistance most of a assessors did the same
1,24-05-2019,absolutely terrible,absolutely terrible no support during placement and three weeks to mark one assessment
5,24-05-2019,was a great way to complete my diploma,was a great way to complete my diploma with lots of support and easy to understand content
1,24-05-2019,terrible,my experience with open colleges was awful from some trainers never writing back to questions on assessments or and taking weeks to respond to messages to having to fight to get my diploma after graduating i had a terrible experience which caused stress and made it harder to complete my studies will never choose them again the only positive was one trainer tracey who was lovely prompt and efficient if it wasnt for tracey i would have rated zero stars open colleges is lucky to have tracey
5,23-05-2019,it was fun to study online as i am,it was fun to study online as i am unable to get to a uni  thank heaps
4,23-05-2019,beauty therapy,great support and help from all the open colleges assessors
4,23-05-2019,a good grounding in graphic design,the website is clear and easy to use  it really needs a feedback section to report dead links and errors in the content typos and grammatical errors  i'd also like to see some sort of differentiation in the sections i'd visited and the ones i'd not seen yet  perhaps a different colourthe graphic design course itself was good  it's definitely aimed at getting the student ready to work as a freelance graphic designer  there was an annoying emphasis on recorded interviews with peers at least  per assignment and i would've liked to see more actual design rather than marketing project management etc  but overall it did give a good basic grounding in graphic design at a diploma levelit was pretty anonymous  the tutor interaction for me was limited to a couple of brief questions about assignments and feedback from the actual assignments  i would've liked having a bit more scheduled interaction where the tutor 'checks in' to monitor progressstudent support were brilliant  prompt to respond and really helpfuli would do another open colleges course
5,22-05-2019,wonderful experience at open colleges,my experience is good the trainer assessor and student support team are helpful and engaging
4,22-05-2019,cert ii in horticulture,the cert ii in horticulture was quite involved with a lot of hands on self learning be prepared though to dip into your own pockets to buy materials as most aren't provided  it was okay for me as i will be using these for my lawn mowing business it would have been good to have more than one lecturer marking as it would make the course faster any issues with admin side of things were also quickly resolved
5,22-05-2019,after using several providors,after using several providors open space was the most userfriendlythe dashboard showing your completion rate is an excellent tool and not unlocking one module until you've finished the previous one is an excellent management tool to help keep selfdirected learners on courseone little improvement would probably be if you could speak to your teacher rather than just dealing over email all the time
5,21-05-2019,really enjoyed doing everything,really enjoyed doing everything trainers and peers were very supportive as well always gave such positive negative critique and help were you needed it as soon as you feel like giving hp just push through it is not that bad you will look back and say well done to yourself as well thank you open colleges for the opportunity i definitely recommend you guys
1,21-05-2019,hated it,had to pay  for a course i never did the way they explained it to me is i sign up and do a trial then have a cooling off period where i get to choose if i complete the course after i signed up they told me my cooling off period had expired and whether i continue with the course or not i still owe the money none of this was explained to me that once i signed up i had to pay the money when i tried to contact someone about leaving the course noone ever returned my calls or when they did i got the same answer that the cooling period is over didn't complete the course still had to pay  over  and a half years and all they did was threaten to send my case to debt collectors for nothing i also found the site hard to navigate i asked for refunds as i wasn't in a state of mind of how overwhelming online study was with no assistance after constant  calls  my final response was the only reason i could get a refund was if i was critically ill with a terminal illness i applied for financial problems and all i got back was that i didn't meet the criteria even though on the website it stated i could get some money back in the end after about  months of trying i just gave up
3,21-05-2019,more one on one support,even though this is an online course there needs to be more telephone contact with students via student support assessors  are very knowledgeable but almost impossible to get through to them with questions
3,18-05-2019,diploma of community services,all assignments were clear easy to follow  complete and submit had trouble uploading the videos however and each time i asked for help with this i just ended up emailing them to student support for marking as i got no real help any other way to submit themwork placement was hard to get in the area that i live in due to the tafe's and uni's around that already have preference on all of the places around the perth area the face to face interview which took  hours via phone was rather messy travis however was so very helpful and was able to fix the bumps in the road for me he should be commended on his patience and time skills as well as his dedication to open colleges
1,17-05-2019,open collages is the worst collage to,open collages is the worst collage to study with firstly they are so rude on the phone they scam people and the material is very bad teachers never get back to you i would never recommend open collages to anyone and they say they have been going for years that's a lot of bs i wouldn't believe  anything they say
5,16-05-2019,i found the bas skillset thorough and,i found the bas skillset thorough and beneficial to my current role as well as for registering as a bas agent the assessor and student services are helpful and patient
5,16-05-2019,all teachers were very helpful,all teachers were very helpfuli did not have a tour to show me how to work my way through the website and it was easy to figure outmarking of assessments were very quick and feedback from teachers were clear and helpful
4,15-05-2019,i found that some of the questions in,i found that some of the questions in the assessments were not very cleari had assessments come back with missing detail but when i read the question it didnt stipulate exactly that the assessor was seekingalso i feel that the course would be quite tricky for people who dont have a lot of computer knowledge in word and excelalso not all email templates were provided to complete questions
4,15-05-2019,my experience with open colleges was all positive,my experience with open colleges was all positive although at times there was a slight delay getting assessments back  this was only minor in regards to my overall experience
3,15-05-2019,not sure if i would use open colleges,not sure if i would use open colleges againthe course material was changed halfway through i was tested on a program which i had never seen or used before i could not go back to previous modules as they were all locked module  was eventually unlocked so that i could see how to use the new program there were lots of mistakes in the new material it was a bit disappointing but at least i have managed to complete the coursethe trainersassessors were very helpful if this were not the case i probably would have given up
5,15-05-2019,found open colleges a wonderful,found open colleges a wonderful experience
1,14-05-2019,biggest waste of time,where to start initially the course is for  years however if you include the fact they take  weeks to mark a unit then you really only get a year and a half if you don't need anything remarked but count on resubmissions because they will request information that isn't written into the coursethe course is marked on trainer discretion ie if you provide a website they don't know  they won't check it they will just mark you down for visa information i provided the government visa website where you apply for visas and was told i should have stated the wikipedia website no not joking  i only passed when i replied telling the trainer i actually apply for visas on a regular basis due to my jobthe course requires around  voice andor video recordings this was not advised and realistically goes overboard  it's not a requirement in this course typically so now not only wasting my time but  other people's alsothe questions are often confusing and written poorly written in broken english or constructed from sentences that don't make sense i believe one example is lead your team to in consultation with your teamthen after struggling through the course content i don't receive my certificate straight away because one grader didn't put a mark in correctly over a year ago where is the quality control that someones grade can be sitting as submission error for a year and a half the only reason it's even being fixed is because i have called several times to find out what is happening the first thing i get is you haven't finished all the work so clearly its not being fixed properly the first time i called i was even advised they had amended the course and i had extra work to completemy advice  choose a different provider because you will have submission errors course content problems will hardly learn anything new if anything at all and just waste your time with this one
3,14-05-2019,open colleges does provide a good idea,open colleges does provide a good idea for study but needs to improve on access to help with assignments as i had lot's of problems getting clarification or assistance with my assignments
5,14-05-2019,good school,good school good courses and excellent support from staff
3,14-05-2019,very slow turn around on assignments,very slow turn around on assignments little flexibility with course choice poor grammar in course content

5,13-05-2019,fiji workplacement,what an awesome experience helping the fijian community gaining work experience and seeing more of the world  it was also a great opportunity to meet the assessors in real life they are awesome real always willing to help and down to earth that made the experience even more special for me also made new friends too along the way having stayed with other students thank you oc it changed my life
3,13-05-2019,vague course and transient trainers,continual change of trainers made it difficult to get a grasp on the course also the course needs to be updated regularly and checked for errors and amended in a timely manner
2,13-05-2019,the actual course was good but,the actual course was good but uploading  videos whilst doing a three week placement in the hospital was so stressful    i was repeatedly told it was possible to upload the videos with the course work because i tried to do this as instructed it crashed all my work a week into the placement   i had to pay someone to come and find the work and take the videos off and organise downsizing the videos   i retried to upload downsized videos and once again crashed the work    it was then recommended that i drop box the work so learnt to dropbox everything and eventually finished all the work and submitted it and waited for it to be marked to be told the sound was not working on a lot of the videos   downsizing the videos had lost the sound so couldnt be marked  the head of the physiotherapy department said she very much doubted she would take on another student from open colleges because there was a lot of videoing and work for her to do      if anyone is reading this review and doing the aha physiotherapy course put all your work on a memory stick and post it it takes about  days to get there and then  days to be marked before you post it get someone else to check it is all on the memory stick as i was told section b was not on the memory stick  videos    i was about to resend this part on another memory stick and get a friend to sign to say it was on there    i had a phonecall at pm to say the work was all on the memory stick the work then had to be resubmitted by them and i had to wait again for the work to be remarkedthe hospital was a great place to do the placement and if future students cannot get a placement there then i would not recommend this course    i am still waiting for my certification to arrive
5,10-05-2019,professional writing  editing course,i recently completed this course after three years of study on the side while working full time and seeing our young family go from one to three young children i found the course content to be interesting and relevant the open colleges team were always easy to deal with and very helpful when i had questions my tutors gave me great feedback with each assignment the online portal was easy to navigate and use a friend recommended open colleges to me and i would not hesitate to recommend them to others
3,09-05-2019,content delivery,i'm not sure about the other courses available however i was very disappointed with the single style of content delivery especially for the steep price we pay to get pages and pages of readingsurely for the price we pay having an audio or video lecture even if its recorded would help add variety to the content my preferred learning style is audio i could listen to course content hours on hours sitting down to read actually disengaged me from learning and i ended up carrying out my assessments using the find text features and skim reading contenthowever i did find my contact with ronnie clark during placement very valuable and he was very good at keeping me motivated
2,09-05-2019,as a adult student that took longer to,as a adult student that took longer to complete my course as life work situations with limited computer skills  living rurallyi feel the college could have made more contact with mechange of course structure during course not acceptable not being notified of thisvariations of answers from different people when i made  contact with themmy online query made has never been answeredas my course was a very hands on practical course i feel that the amount of hours and detail of practical work completed was not taken into considerationafter two half years of saying my address for a security question answer they need a more accurate onenow i have completed i am still awaiting my certification  weeks later
5,09-05-2019,great course and excellent educators on,great course and excellent educators on hand to help i had lots of questions throughout the course and was always able to be pointed in the right direction
4,07-05-2019,sometimes confusing content with no,sometimes confusing content with no explanation on examples and wastes multiple days waiting for response to queries and much too long for results for assignments

4,06-05-2019,it was great studying with open,it was great studying with open colleges they are flexible and can adjust to request of students students are kept informed of what is going on in the college and alerts of short courses modules are well detailed and i found it easy to study in the middle of nowhere in the field where i don't have any professional people in line of my studies to help me with my studies but only rely on my ownstudent support staff are quick to respond to email request assessors supports students very well despite the distance and time difference they mark assessments within the stipulated time study fees are very manageablei recommend open colleges without any reservations to those who want to study with themthank you
4,06-05-2019,i loved the course and i feel like i,i loved the course and i feel like i learnt alot
3,05-05-2019,review  adjust to fit oc environment,the situations to explain the concepts were unfamiliar to most of us in the call team so we could not grasp the concepts as well as we wouldve liked to for most of us this is our first or second full time job so if the materialsquizzes  were somehow suited to the environment of oc we wouldve understood better other than that it was productive as it suited different learning styles such as visual and audio
2,04-05-2019,no placement waste of money,i first enquired regarding a course online and then was called immediately with more information i requested they promised all the help and support i would need throughout my course which the trainers and assessors were amazing upon the last leg of my course was an absolute disaster i called  different organisations and emailed them and then sent follow up emails to try obtain placement to this day i still dont have placement and will not be able to finish my course even open colleges cannot find me placrment i have now wasted alot of money as knowone will take on online students for placement not only were they happy to take my money no other solutions were offered but to keep paying more money to keep me enrolled in the course till placement is found which is highly unlikely ill be able to find placement
5,02-05-2019,dont hesitate do it now,i would definitely recommend open colleges the course material was easy to follow the staff were always contactable and very happy to answer any questions i work full time have two young kids and was able to complete my course cert  business admin well within the timeframe setthank you to the staff at open colleges for making this possible
3,01-05-2019,throughtout the course it was hard to,throughtout the course it was hard to understand what was being asked of me at times i found that a lot of other students had the same problem when i spoke to them the assessors how ever were absolutely amazing  both sarah and travis went above and beyond to answer any questions i was so glad to have travis as my workplace assessor he was so knowledgeable in all aspects and made me feel very confident and comfortable throughout the wpa visit
5,29-04-2019,overall experience,negativesresponses to questions on open forum and via message can take too long to get backassessment  has an error in one of the form templates and one of the template guides is not included in the list of linked documents  i notified jim johnson of the specificsfeedback from assessors was in a variety of formats x results form completed by assessor  was great as we can use these to show our employersmajority via direct comments in emailmessaging or comments added to the submitted assessmentmight be nice to have consistency  if the form is to be used it should used for all responsesassessment  is in a very different format to all the others and could be shortened in terms of how the instructions and case study summary is written  it's quite confusing to follow  it's a very time consuming and draining subject to tackle last  it would be easier for the student to understand if it was in the same format as all the others  i personally found it a bit of a shock and it took me lots of repeat reading and comparing between the case study information and the assessment requirement as there appeared to be conflicting information between the twopositivesthe quality of feedback is very good especially the comments in assessments by simon peppercorn  very constructive and transparent on exactly what could be improved and why as well as and what was good whyi like the way the dashboard works and the video function saves a lot of mucking aroundvery regularly when i finished up recorded a video i would then upload the written assessment and the platform would reject it so i was submitting them via dropbox  i only realised later that i logged out and logged back in it worked  was a bit annoying  quite frustrating at the time as i didn't know what to do about itbut overall a great platform  i am very relieved i am finishedthanks to all the assessors for their feedback especially simon peppercorn who marked most of them
4,28-04-2019,diploma of business,diploma of businessgreat learning material helpful assessors and student support it has been an overall positive experience and i can highly recommend this course to anyone who is motivated and selfdisciplined and wants to pursue further study
1,26-04-2019,impossible to transfer previous academic transcripts,i also forgot to mention in my previous review a few minutes ago that i tried for nearly a year to get my previous university's academic transcripts transferred over to open colleges but it never got done nor followed up properly meanwhile the student support promised me that it would be done waste of time
1,26-04-2019,very disappointed overall,first of all it would be crucial to have uptodate content in the assessments in  we still work with old content content referring to older versions of macos or windows secondly i was told when enrolling for this course that the student support had a free international phone number that you can call anytime if you have issues but warning  it is absolutely not free especially if you're like me and study in open colleges from overseas i also want to mention how long it really takes to sometimes get assessment feedback although some assessors do correct them quicker than the official timeframe given  daysassessment if your goal is to study fulltime in an online course with open colleges do not enroll i repeat do not enroll you are wasting your time however if you want to study a course parttime you can give it a try but i still wouldn't recommend it i have much other stuff to point out such as lack of support by the student support and not to mention the extremely slow online campus platform openspace  despite my very highspeed home network above mbps they also advertise about study buddies that are sort of online classmates it never worked despite me asking for support regarding this  i am overall very disappointed and i wish my experience would've been better as there are some interesting courses and assessments as well i can't list everything that's bad because it would be too long but i do have one positive point and that is how relatively affordable it is if you plan on studying full time i recommend the monthly payment option as you can save tons of money if you finish several months earlier than the given course deadline this college has potential however there is a significant amount of things to be reviewed and changed in order to make the experience more pleasant for the students i wish the future students a hopefully better experience with open colleges
4,26-04-2019,it has been a rough journey but we have,it has been a rough journey but we have michelle  compassionate our trainer who was very supportive and encouraging throughout

4,22-04-2019,overall positive experience,overall positive experience  the accessors were always very helpful and precise in providing feedback  i felt student support did not have adequate knowledge to assist and as such often generic or non committal information was provided  there was very little assistance for technical issues  overall would i recommend open colleges yes i would

4,17-04-2019,good course but could be better managed,the actual course was amazing in how it was broken down i found the notes and teaching really done well the student supprt team are hardworking kind and go give and beyond it just takes a while to wait for things to be marked and got back to you sometimes however i found it a bit unprofessional some of my feedback and important workplace documents were completed but just sat there in their office and were not sent or told me until i rang its like they just complete what is done then forget to tell u so you are left waiting not knowing whats going on
5,17-04-2019,study at own pace and time,being able to study at my pace and at my time made completing this course something i would recommend to others they have a wealth of important on the site that was easy to find and the support staff are extremely helpful with any questions i had
4,16-04-2019,good,goodthe overall experience of open colleges was fairly good some time delays were frustrating and sometimes the slowness of resultsfeedback caused some issuesthe inappropriateness of the indigenous module was very offensive and needs to be reassessed by an appropriate person who is of aboriginal andor torres strait islander decent preferably an elder also being aware that different mobstribes have very different customs and what is acceptable to one mob may not be to anotherthis may also be the same for the information about the cald community and my concern is that incorrect information is being given to students on both subject
4,15-04-2019,my experience at open colleges,my experience at open collegesi have taken my approach towards open colleges with the utmost professionalismi found the course to suit the requirements of what my current employment as case manager beneficial in all the assessmentsi found the course itself to be relevant to the tasks at hand in my employmenti found the marking feedback very good and i have taken on board the remarks made by my assessor travis hackett although i waited almost a year after submitting my first email  for an assessor eventually my grades were finalised in april i guess assessors were overworked or outnumbered with considerable amount of grading students papershowever assessor travis hackett made up for it i found travis to be an exceptional assessor he knew his job well and i found him to be very helpful as well as approachablethere was one other issue that i did have and it had to do with another person who graded my work as i worked in the field of case management i provided examples in my community pertaining to the questionunfortunately his feedback was that i was getting too emotional with my views again i am a professional and i stated to him i only answered what the question provided those types of feedback is not what i wanted to hear but otherwise i redid the question and to this day i believed the marker could have been more professional and not judgmental about my worki was annoyed when i commenced my course that almost into it after completing several assessments they were no longer required due to an update in the overall structure of the open colleges program i get that and i understood what it was for and so i continued and eventually got over itbut in general it was a good project i would consider telling others about open colleges for me it met my needs and studying during the evenings at my pace doing placement at my employment was really a bonusthank you phyllis sullivan
5,15-04-2019,business,great course  i have learnt so much
3,15-04-2019,generally a good experience,the course was well structured and layed outi was moved around assessors for my last two assessments which did cause some issuesi know i took a longer than the allocated time to complete the assignments but that was due to factors beyond my control two shoulder surgeries running an operational business that is open  days a week family issues with a high needs daughter to name just a few issues and i thank oc for their understandingi feel my last assessor just brushed me off as he took  and  hours to go over my last  assignments and just gave me a passi felt i had put so much work into these they deserved better than a passing glancethe team in the on line chat were overall good to deal with as were support team via phone callsthanks you all for the experience i will recommend oc to my family and friends
3,15-04-2019,my experience was quite a journey,my experience was quite a journey i had many dramas with my course as i was told i was one of the last to do the  module certificate and it changed to a  module never the less through it all i had my ups and downs but overall it was not to bad the on line coaches where better good some new what they where talking about others didn't which was a little frustrating at times but the came ronnie clark wow that guy was amazing he went above and beyond to him me through the last stages honestly because of him is the reason why i finished the course he truly is a remarkable and genuine person and i can't thank him enough thank you open space and thank ronnie clark i have forwarded another  people through this course hopefully they are as successful as me
1,14-04-2019,absolutely ridiculous is what i have to,absolutely ridiculous is what i have to say about open colleges i had sent several emails and made several calls only to have different answers by all the support staffevery time i made a phone call it said that i had already made a query and they were going to get back to me never once did i receive a phone call or a email the service is extremely pooryour staff don't know how to communicate or leave messages about the students questions and leave the student feeling unsupported because of this through my entire enrollment i feel as though the only thing the college wanted was my money and nothing elsethe amount of times i rang the school about finally finishing my course and waiting for my certificate and being told by several staff from the student support that i should wait and it was on its way was a total load of crap no one had every opened the fifth portal because i was told several times that it was an elective and i didn't need to do it only to be told after i rang nearly four months later that i needed to complete my first aid course how hard is it to contact your students to ask how they are travelling or to find out why they haven't completed something as easy as their first aid certificate so they can finally graduatei am greatly appaulled by my entire experience with open colleges and i will never recommend this school to anyone ever

1,12-04-2019,open colleges  waste of time,literally spent just over two years doing a course once i was finished the course i did not hear anything  sent emails asking what was happening if i needed to do anything else because on my end everything was complete and no reply months late still nothing if you want to waste your time and get nothing in return then do a course with open colleges
3,10-04-2019,things i struggled with,received different information from different student supportfeedback from assessors was different on the same assignmentsassignments took a very long time to be marked and handed backdeliberately sabotaged confusing questions on assignments with the hope that the assessors would send me back feedback on how to answer the questions properlyonly found a couple of assessors reliablehelpfulsome seemingly unnecessary things to cover during the workplace practical component of the certificatei definitely wasn't much help to myself due to personal things that happened through out completing this course but the things i have written above definitely contributed to me struggling through this course as well
3,10-04-2019,easy to use friendly staff but wish i learned more from my course,i wish i learned a bit more from my course besides that fact opencolleges was easy to use all the team members were very helpful and friendly and i enjoyed my course

4,01-04-2019,i think the correction time should be,i think the correction time should be reduced not for when work is submitted but after resubmissionsafter corrections are done if need beso too much time is not wastedalso if a video and document need to be uploaded there is no clarity whether the doc has to be resubmitted after it goes to draftto first allow the video to uploadlots of confusion there and different people advise differently each time
2,30-03-2019,the worst educational experience of my,the worst educational experience of my life paid twice what i would at tafe submissions took up to  weeks to get marked on average  weeks some were faster many slower and i was required to get  in every test or i would have to resubmit and wait a few more weeks to get marked phone lines were rarely working and being 'maintained' more often than not two stars instead of one as the staff were polite all staff were knowledgable and willing to help but grossly understaffed this review is a reflection on ownership and management
4,29-03-2019,great if you can self manage your own,great if you can self manage your own learning and stick to a time tablevery helpful assessors when you need them
1,28-03-2019,would not recommend,would not recommend if i could i would give  stars leaving your course will set you back the entire course fees even though i have provided medical certificates and am not in the right mental state to study
2,28-03-2019,rpl refund issue,i made initial contact with open colleges in january  hoping to do an rpl for a certificate  in acute care they convinced me that i needed to submit the required documents and pay a  assessment fee i was told that upon completion of the assessment they will let me know which units i needed to do the assessment never took place instead one of their staff members called me after more than  business days wanting to go through an enrolment process which required more money i complained that i wasn't told about an enrolment before the rpl assessment the assessment eventually did not go through because i felt that the whole process wasn't explained to me properly they said that they would refund the  that was more than  weeks ago efforts to get that refund have been fruitless i spoke to one of their staff members  days ago they promised to work on processing that refund asap but after multiple attempts to contact open colleges there has been no response i honestly feel shortchanged by this institution
3,27-03-2019,honest review,i found the content of the course was full of spelling mistakes  poor grammar and broken links to reading materialssome assessment and quiz questions were quite ambiguous and sentences structured strangely which led to negative feedback on some assignmentswebsite was relatively easy to use
5,26-03-2019,oct,customer service was amazing and overall a really good experience recommendable
4,26-03-2019,the staff and trainers are amazing and,the staff and trainers are amazing and understanding theyre amazingly helpful in getting people to reach their dreams and goals

2,25-03-2019,took so long to get back from,took so long to get back from assessors back and forth so many times to just ask one questions my last assessment took more than one month to get marked some assessors were helpful but some of them were did not put effort to help me and marked my assessment  low mark some assessment was lack of explanations and asking too much in assessment which some of them did not cover the study materialsi would not go back to study online again i wasted a lot of time
4,24-03-2019,fantastic platform and friendly,fantastic platform and friendly environmentuseful information to get the basic knowledge for my next career path to be an electrical apprenticeship really recommend it
4,23-03-2019,youth work certificate iv,youth work certificate iva big thank you to the student support team and assessors for helpingme through the course it took me longer to complete the course due to work commitments and at times found it hard to complete some of the assessments but after calling the support team and speaking to them they put me back on trackit was good that i could request course extensions that help me and take some of stress away the only thing that puzzled me was that a friend of mine was doing the same course as me but he had different modules than methank you open collegeskind regardssteve
2,23-03-2019,communication was poor,communication was poor unreliable and inconsistentopen space did not provide the infrastructure to submit large assessment files
4,22-03-2019,self paced learning,i enjoyed the flexibility of online studying  trainers and assessiors were supportive and accessiblei did however have issue with the profile never reflecting true progress i found the modules were difficult to keep up with as they were modified and moved about i think changes should be made the same time each yearthe course was very thorough and interesting i feel well equipped for my new vocation
5,22-03-2019,i was totally new to nursing having,i was totally new to nursing having been in an academic field all my life the course definitely spurred my interest the assessments required me to go beyond the course notes there was no spoon feeding at all and required a lot of hard work but at my own pace since it was an online course i actively researched a lot to find the answers and in the process broadened my horizon in this field the assessors and trainers were so helpful and understanding towards my needsi would recommend open colleges to anyone who is interested in excelling in their field of interest and their future
4,21-03-2019,diploma of leadership  management,i felt the course was very well structured with a wellplanned flow allowing you to apply knowledge learnt as you progressed through the modules and assessments coming from a background in management i found the subject material to be relevant and applicable and i have assimilated several aspects of the course into improving my daytoday functionson occasion a number of assessments contained tasks which were unclear or ambiguous in their requirements where i needed to seek clarification from the assessors unfortunately there is a relatively long response time open space advises is up to  business days which complicates your ability to smoothly progress through the course however i was consistently pleased with the detailed and targeted feedback i received which provided very helpful guidance and direction to research and submit accurate responses to the assessmentsoverall a challenging and rewarding experience  i would certainly recommend to others with a foreword to consider the unique aspects of online study to confirm it is suited to their individual learning requirements before commencing
5,21-03-2019,student support is difficult,student support is difficult not easily helping
3,21-03-2019,thanks,i believe the platform needs to be updated very often since the information and articles are pretty old as well as some of the links dont work  but other than that great experience and valuable support from tutors
5,21-03-2019,thank you to all student support team and assessors,i would like to thank all student support team for helping me manage to pull through the course at one stage l nearly gave up but each time l spoke to the support team l got all the support in terms of study time i know l made several request for the course extension but the team worked around to help me get the extensions my work did not give me much time because l would have lost earnings if l wanted to request for study time especially the fact that a lot of mines are still tumbling economically from the assessor l got all the feedback that pointed me in the right direction and l want thank them i wont hesitate to recommend anyone because l know they will manage through even if they encounter difficulties with study time they will always get the feedback to get them into the direction they want to even myself l will not hesitate advancing my studies with open collegethank you again for the grateful assistancebest regardsjim madzvimbo
4,21-03-2019,i would recommend open colleges to anyone,i thought this was the best way to study for me especially with family and work commitments they were very flexible and tried helping as quickly as they could

5,18-03-2019,perfect timing,the assesors always answered my questions very quickly and were very helpful and always graded my assessments within one day which was great
5,18-03-2019,open colleges has been very supportive,open colleges has been very supportive with my studies the online aspect is very user friendly i have enjoyed my time studying with them
5,17-03-2019,open colleges is the best online study,open colleges is the best online study in the world very organized opinionated knowledge quality at its best online study at home at your own paced is the best thing to do you can study anytime and anywhere my own time to study is my best time i got it from open colleges
4,17-03-2019,the course was excellent,the course was very good the content was challenging and i have resources that i can refer throughout my career some of the course notes had questions that were hard to decipher and there were many grammatical errors i would recommend that the course trainers get together and moderate the course overall to ensure students get a consistent expectation of what is requiredof them i enjoyed it overall and the you were all very helpful thanks
2,16-03-2019,certificate iv bookkeeping,overall i wouldn't recommend or choose to study again via open colleges  i found the course material to be of average quality with a number of spelling grammatical  other errors  examples  case study's were not well explained often lacking the 'workings' of how an answer was arrived at  in a bookkeeping or accounting course you often need to see the workings of how a result is achieved there were a lot of comments on the course material where students had identified errors in the material  they had not been corrected  this would often represent an incorrect answer being in the study notes  without comments from previous students would never have been identified  i found an error in an exam that when i contacted the assessor they confirmed the exam was wrong  the staff  tutors were helpful when you made contact with them however replies could take time to come back therefore leaving you unable to move forwardwhen i enrolled in the course i specifically enquired that the course was mac compatible however when i came to the using the accounting software myob the study notes were written for windows  i had to do my own research on adapting the course material  exams requirements to mac  some of the functionality is completely different between windows  mac  students had to research how to do different functions  study notes should be available for both windows  mac if the course is represented as sucha couple of the later modules had webinars offered  that was extremely helpful as you could ask real time questions during the webinar  get accurate information from an assessor  a lot of the modules through the course should have had a webinar  tutorial to allow for accurate information to be suppliedopen colleges need to go through the study notes  comments supplied by students  fix the errors in the course material when it is identified
5,16-03-2019,best trainers and best admin staff,i was so impressed and grateful for the effort put into the feedback of the assesments resources were really good and assignments helped me gain confidence in what i need to prepare for when i start to look for a job related to the field i graduated in the trainers were so so so kind and helpful and the open colleges staff are so helpful and graduating the students to a high standard are at their best interestthank you open colleges
3,16-03-2019,finally made it,i am a single mum of  and it took me a fair amount of effort to get through this even though once engaged i was completely emersed and loving it the reason being i had difficulty getting a study buddy at first i had one but seeing as she was younger and didn't have the 'distraction' of kids she flew right past me i tried multiple times to gain another studdy buddy after that but to no availss are very helpful overall at assisting as much as they possibly could but many times technology or communications to trainers wasn't the bestone trainer in particular was very easy to communicate with and very flexible with her times which makes it easier to clarify assessments before commencing them it is difficult when you are working and some tutors who will only make themselves available the few days they might be in the officein the end i made it through and feel very fulfilled and proud of my achievement
5,16-03-2019,my experience was great,i had a great experience i was one of the students who got near halfway through original diploma content then had to start over on new course when government made new standards initially it irritated me because i had liked the old format better but quickly i learned that it was a great benefit as i got to develop a very solid foundation that took me from theory straight into practicestudent support always helped when i needed just a phone call away the assessors were all wonderful and  i learned so much from them my fiji experience was life changing and something i will never forget i loved everything from my studiesthere were some hangups at times such as quizzes that could be painful as you are required to get  and there were some glitches early on but from that it helped me to learn even more so it was okay as i progressed i did not encounter any further issuesi would highly recommend diploma of counselling through open colleges if you are willing to learn and put energy into your development you will be well supported to go very far
2,15-03-2019,my experience with open colleges for aha physiotherapy,i didn't get much support from oc except from one of the tutors also a big turn over on tutors the cost of the course is way over priced also i found that a lot of time was wasted from waiting for reply of any questions and markings of course notes the  week work experience was huge far too much work like videos packed into this time frame just not practical to do at all which i didn't learn much only how to do videos also which is a joke you had to get  right every question even through it was only a cert  course doing the full physiotherapy diploma they don't have to get everything right oc wouldn't give me any prior learning on this course i havent got my certificate yet due to my part of cpr for the first aid has run out so now i have to do this cpr part again before i can get the certificate but oc doesn't let you know that it was due to expire  i would recommend doing face to face course instead
4,15-03-2019,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open colleges and the cert iv in accounting and bookkeeping i would definitely recommend this course

5,14-03-2019,would recommend open collages for all,would recommend open collages for all looking to study online its helpful and supportive  i would also recommend the fiji work placement project its a rewarding two weeks you have to be prepared to work hard but you learn so many new skills confidence and cultural experiences you wont get this opportunity again so i recommend you go the trainers that run the program are supportive and down to earth and its quite cheap for what you get out of it

5,12-03-2019,i have been taking the nutrition course,i have been taking the nutrition course for over a year now during this time i have relocated countries and have had two small children to look after whilst working part time open colleges have been fantastic in the sense they have always given me the flexibility and time to finish the course which i have so badly wanted to do as soon as i started the tools and information provided have been amazing making it easy to manage and navigate around i would highly recommend an open colleges course to anyone seeking further education
5,12-03-2019,my experience with open colleges was,my experience with open colleges was fantastic
3,08-03-2019,certificate  individual support aged,certificate  individual support aged care home and community  underwhelming experience on multiple fronts first this course requires a work placement in residential care which isnt made clear until after youve paid for the course  this placement has to be found by the student almost no residential facilities want students who study online particularly in rural areas and this almost meant i couldnt complete course links in course notes regularly did not work or were out of date notes were repetitive and long winded and didnt always cover what was in assessments for rural students no assessor comes to your work placement which is a joke as assessment is done by phone but they didnt get round to phone call until  months after i had done work placement open colleges computer system for online study is not suitable for apple computers or ipad so assignments didnt download adequately and lost formatting when uploadingthis was a nightmare  student support did not have solutions to this issue and would say theyd get back to you but never did  some course material was awful the cultural diversity section was eye wateringly bad and had clearly not been written by someone educated in this area
5,08-03-2019,excellant service all round,excellent service all round
4,08-03-2019,assessment feedback,sometimes the  business day turn around of marking assessments was a little frustrating if you were waiting on that mark to come back before progressing to the next module  given that i work full time and study time was limited
5,08-03-2019,a big thank you,i had a great experience learning through open colleges with help and support on hand when i needed it now i am a fully qualified educator thoroughly enjoying my new career running my family daycare thank you open colleges for helping me achieve my goal
5,07-03-2019,it was good time and good to learn with,it was good time and good to learn with open collages
3,06-03-2019,individual support cert iii,i probably wouldn't go through this again any time soon the course was a lot of work for what it was with not much support it was hard to get in touch with assessors and any communication would take a long time the assignments weren't very clear on what was expected with questions not worded clearly and a satisfactory mark dependent on who was marking it the course would suit a dole bludger with plenty of time on their hands but i expect that type of person would have less patince than i and thus probably not do to well in the caring industry but i shouldn't make assumptions i digress i would have liked a better standard given what i paid and the time i put in but hey i got a certificate out of it
1,06-03-2019,i honestly wish i didn't undertake,i honestly wish i didn't undertake studies with open colleges  i was drawn to them due to they were online and that it was flexible with working full time i have previously undertaken study twice before this and this was defiantly the worst i have experienced ever luckily i was only completing a certificate iv i would hate to think how frustrated people may be undertaking above this when you make first contact with open colleges all seems well  after you inquire they will call you nonstop like telemarketers until they can sign you up the next stage of the process of when you start your course just appears to go down hill from here some assessors not all are very slack and they're obviously understaffed with massive workloadsexpect to wait and wait and wait for your assessments to eventually get marked the main concern i had with them was the online portal which has never ending technical difficulties this consists on students who are left feeling very frustrated and having to redo quiz's or other assessments multiple times until you give up and have to call the office to get assistance the student support and the office will just tell you the same thing each time and that they are looking into this unfortunately this appears to keep recurring the assessments are very poorly written and in some cases you will find yourself reading over the same question multiple times overall i would not recommend anyone to undertake studies with this place and to do your research in other rto's or higher education if you can if your course consists of you undertaking a student placement and you are relying on your course to get you a step into an industry i would not recommend them this process is a long waiting game to even start the student process and once you have expect zero support they will call you and your manager to make contact and appear to be professional but then for  hours of student placement i had zero contact until the end of my placement their response when i spoke to someone regarding this was you can call us if you are having issues luckily i was already working in the industry of my study i  could help think about if someone was undertaking this placement and didn't have prior experience on how they would feel with zero support and guidance so overall i would say if i could go back  don't do it
1,06-03-2019,find a different online study organization,i do not recommend themthe only time they reach out to you is for their money they don't care about your academic success you get ignored despite chasing multiple trainers for help their open space is always glitched the work placement assessment is a joke they set up a date for my wpa and then did a no show with no phone call if it wasn't for the other students doing the same course in a facebook group i wouldn't have made it through this company is an absolute joke and i cannot believe they're still allowed to run i've studied online before with other companies who actually call you and see how you are going in your course open colleges would never do that they're about business that's it i paid k for my diploma and felt so alone and have also just discovered my diploma isn't even nationally recognized with a lot of places a waste of my time and money
4,06-03-2019,some of the modules had outdated links,some of the modules had outdated links for the practise exercises and there is too much 'role play' for the assessments  i understand that you need an audio to establish that students are getting critiquefeedback but role plays are not necessary  admittedly i am  and i don't not want to do a role play for an assessmentotherwise i liked a lot of the exercises and i enjoy learning  perhaps i should have enrolled in graphic design rather than digital design
5,05-03-2019,highly recommend open colleges,the course has gained me future advancement very patient helpful and friendly assessors trainers and support peoplehighly recommend open collegesdiploma in community services is my next future endevourthanks for helping me

1,28-02-2019,open colleges is so painful and unclear,open colleges is so painful and uncleari hadnt received my rd study period for  week after finishing my nd study period i called and emailed more then twice and was stuffed aroundon the th call to them to ask them what was going on this is  weeks of not receiving my rd sp they tell me it cant be accessed until i find work placement so not only are they withdrawing money from my account for me to not have any study material they also couldve told me that when i called the first time instead they dragged it out the cooling of period is only  days once you enroll by which i hadnt even received any study material to decide whether or not i want to proceeda waste of money and just a painful experience
1,27-02-2019,disappointing experience considering the huge financial outlay,the course relied on outdated and irrelevant youtube videos and web articles and very little content that was created by the college the college's meagre content was riddled with spelling and grammar errors and was very amateurish and often nonsensical the majority of the tutors were disinterested and not at all supportive yet always willing to blow their own horns about their personal abilities they seem to think that ten business days is acceptable to reply to emails or mark assignments overall the experience was disappointing and not one i would repeat
5,27-02-2019,my experience in this teacher assistant,my experience in this teacher assistant course was very rewarding since it helped me to catch up on all the modules related to the teaching of the studentand will surely help me in my performance in some workplacei would recommend to students who wish to start in this career a lot of effort and dedication and not give up to complete the course that is not easy but with effort you can finishcatherine  pestana

5,22-02-2019,truely recommend open colleges,i'm a mum of a yo so was in a dilemma if i can study or not and wasted almost  year that's when i found open colleges with online study option  so i registered with them but still i was unsure if i can cope up with the assessments that's when i found  eliana vogiatzis my favorite trainer she replies to my queries within minutes  eliana's support increased my interest in the course and confidence for the future of my careerall the other trainers and assessors so far i have contacted are very helpful and gave good reviews and telling me exactly how to answer the questionsthankful for all of them and specially eliana this is for anyone who is in a dilemma to study or not better late than never go for it achieve your dreams

4,20-02-2019,if you want a broad overview of the,if you want a broad overview of the history of photography and everything it takes to be a working photographer in today's environment then this course is great planning inspiration composition lighting fairly advanced editing in lightroom and photoshop networking and all aspects of the business of being a photographer are covered the assessments are not easy and often require a second attempt to get what the assessor is looking for as they are worded a bit ambiguously sometimes that usually means you have to dig deeper and that isn't a bad thingthe admin side of things all worked smoothly
5,19-02-2019,cool study,great place to study and smart independent study options they provide i had good study time with my classmate and caring educator who always openly communicate and assist students in and out the classroom i recommend to have agooo
2,18-02-2019,great trainers and assessors but poor customer service,i find the trainers and assessors knowledgeable and competitivehowever customer service officers are inconsistent inefficient and sometimes rude everytime i  call customer service the last few months i got a runaround and if i did not tell them i wanted to make a complaint i wouldnt have graduated until nowone customer service officer lexie even raised her voice at me when i advised of my disappointment and frustration about not getting the right response she also provided me with incorrect information about the timezone for the assessor checkpoint told me it was sydney time i almost missed my appointment thats unacceptable and because of that interaction with customer service officers i wouldnt want any of my friends or anyone i know to experience the same treatment while studying

4,17-02-2019,i was pretty happy with open colleges,i was pretty happy with open colleges once i got my head around how to stay in contact with assessors and trainers i started to feel more comfortable  they were awesome to me when i needed an extension as i need more time due to personal tragedies in my life x  and unfortunately was not confident enough to trust myself that i could complete this course  i have proved to myself that i can do anything i put my mind too  thank you open colleges
3,16-02-2019,overall my experience as ok,overall my experience as oki was disappointed that although i was to have three communications with my trainer during workplacement i had none i appreciate that sanet was ill but the college should have referred my situation to another trainer this was an obvious breach of the workplace placement arrangement and created a very poor impression with my workplace supervisorthe consequence of this failing by the college was that it took me several attempts to complete the first assignment relating to workplacement and that only after a phone allat one point i asked the trainer for a point of clarifcation in the process of the workplacement assignments her reply was if you read the  i found this condescending and insultingthe criteria against which assignments were marked has two roles one to be the benchmark for assessment the second is to be instructive i did not find the criteria sufficiently specific to be instructiveoften feedback from the trainers was too brief and where there were shortcomings did not identify the specific area to be addressed eg activity  section  needsi appreciate the trainers cannot be interrupted on ad hoc basis but when times are set by the trainer they must be kept as an example i had a time set for  and the trainer did not ring ifollowed up told she would ring back she did hours later when i had gone had to work another time she rang back an hour past with the excuse she had been in a meeting a message could have saved me sitting around idle waitingi am impressed with the speed with which the course was finalised and certificate sent out well done
4,15-02-2019,great support and feedback was providedproject management,great support and feedback was provided by the course educators however the course content was often not updated to reflect the correct unit or topic number it often made it difficult to find the learning material or to understand the assignment requirementsi noticed several times other students had posted their feedback more then  mths earlier about the same issue i had identified and it had still not been updatedoverall i would study with open colleges again
4,15-02-2019,great content,great content really learnt alot assessors responded quickly with meaningful support maybe the only trouble was the nonconstruction material was a little too difficult
4,14-02-2019,a great online study experience,the course material was great easy to access and well designed  each module built on the knowledge from the previous one  my online experience was great  so easy to access from any location  there was a variety of trainers and all were helpful  i feel prepared to go into my chosen career
5,14-02-2019,what an amazing experience,i have never experienced such a helpful informative and supportive learning program like open colleges i recommend to all the skills ive developed through the handbooks is incredible  turning my nonexistent knowledge of excel into fully understanding complex skills
5,13-02-2019,really helpful student support,really helpful student support they are available after hours which is really good if studying online and a fulltime worker understanding of time restraints and fast at any enquiries did not have any issues with open colleges at all would recommend
3,12-02-2019,some of the learning content was out,some of the learning content was out dated for a dual certificate not enough time is allowed as you get the same timeframe for one certificate overall support was tardy in responding to queries and lastly some assessors feedback was not descriptive enough as opposed to others that were brilliant my overall learning experience was good and i thank open colleges these things are mentioned as constructive criticism
2,11-02-2019,wouldnt do it again,found it annoying having to wait for markers to mark assignments until we could move on to next module at one stage i waited nearly  weeks i didnt like how we had to have every single answer correct on an assignment having to resubmit until everything was correct and waiting for the markers again way too much paperwork for work placement this should be summarised especially the parts supervisors have to sign i found students who went through tafe had a much easier experience completing their course
4,11-02-2019,i really enjoyed studying with open,i really enjoyed studying with open colleges as i could study at my own pace and i ended up finishing a  year disploma in just  year  i had very few problems with open colleges so that wouldnt stop me from studying with them again
5,11-02-2019,very flexible and easy to navigate,very flexible and easy to navigate
4,10-02-2019,good but needs tweaking,overall it was a good experience however i found some of the material to have poor grammar and punctuation another very exasperating experience was one quiz question which really only had two responses  the response was appropriate or the response was not appropriate this particular question had another option  a fullstop in front of the response was appropriatev and this ridiculous option was the correct answer with this and some other poorly worded answers it felt like the college wants people to fail i can't imagine how difficult it would be for english as second language studentsfurther i sent couple of emails through about some of these very strange answers and no one ever replied to me which i think is rather rudeso please have someone go through your courses check then using spell check and check that all answer options actually make sense
3,09-02-2019,i would not complete further studies,i would not complete further studies through open colleges throughout my studies i contacted a few different trainers to ask for clarification on the assessments each time they responded they simply copied and pasted the assessment question this did not answer my query and was not helpful at all i simply had to muddle through myself thankfully i was on the right track and was able to obtain a hd or a d i also found that most of the assessment questions were not worded clearly hence why i had to ask for clarification from my trainers i felt that the assessments could have been cleared and from reading the messages boards for every single module other students felt the same the message boards went back at least  months with the same queries which were never fixed in the assessments the learning materials themselves were acceptable it was the assessments and trainers that left something to be desired i planned to complete further studies but after this experience i will not be back
5,09-02-2019,cert iv finanacial services,cert iv finanacial services  bookkeepingit was a comprehensive course and a qualification required for retaining a bas agent's licenselook being a very mature student it was challenging at times but that was more to do with a transient life style than with the actual material  i do enjoy learning new things all the time open learning's patience in allowing me the extra time to finish this course was extremely generous and of course a huge help to meit has been an experience of great benefit and of course i would recommend open colleges to any person considering upgrading their skills or acquiring new ones

2,07-02-2019,extremely poorly written assignments,extremely poorly written assignments and very unclear what was actually required tried to provide this feedback though the course but nothing changed i would not study here again

4,06-02-2019,open colleges  high standards of delivering education,i found open colleges a good organisation to deal with sometimes a bit harsh on marking and expectations but appreciate this because the organisation has set high standards of delivering education to its clients

5,01-02-2019,maracertificate iii children support,few months ago i finished my course certificate iii children support and i really enjoyed it it was hard because i was not a good level of english or maybe was the confidence anyway this course gave me the opportunity to improve my english besides to get knowledge about australian education system it was a great aventure that did increasing my confident and now i am not a perfect english speaker but i am a good teacher assistant i recived the best suport from my assesor and trainers from open college besides enjoyed from the work placement where i had luck to find a job before finish my course now i still motivated and with expectative of future and why not with more plans to improve my qualifications finally i would like to give thanks to open colleges for this opportunity and for you support
4,01-02-2019,most of my experiences were positive,most of my experiences were positive every time i had questions they were answered within a day if i didn't understand they were more than willing to help me understand the few issues i had were related to issues with the upload of my assessments but this was due to an issue with my student number when this was sorted it all worked well
5,01-02-2019,great online study experience,i loved doing this course with open collegesthe fees are affordable and even when u do not finish ur course on time ur given extra time at an affordable expensethe support guys are wonderfulthey help with anything and everything and repond to ur inqury with hrs sometimes soonerthe trainer and assessors are amazing great feedback and ur given the chance to correct your mistakesopen colleges has given a great online study experiencethank you all especially roberto the organisation he found me  for my work placement for my disability course took methank you all for being such great support
4,30-01-2019,studying by correspondence for the,studying by correspondence for the first time proved very difficult for me  the biggest struggle was having a question and not being able to put my hand up and get an immediate answer  you email your trainerassessor and wait up to sometimes a couple of days to get a response  in saying that every trainerassessor i had was very helpful and it is a correspondence course so that is the nature of the beast  all feedback given to me was very constructive and informative i think everyone needs to remember that the trainers are busy too and get back to the students as quickly as they can overall happy with the experience  i graduated  and will look to study again in a few years  i have learned a valuable skill hopefully and that is not to leave everything until the last minute
5,30-01-2019,it was a great course and the teachers,it was a great course and the teachers are lovely
3,30-01-2019,three stars,the set up of the course was easy to navigate for my particular course i was a little disappointed with the relevance of the content and it was very repetitive when faced with difficulty i was disappointed with the response from student support i cant speak for the whole of open colleges but i wouldnt recommend my course to others
5,30-01-2019,certificate iv in bookkeeping,i took certificate iv in bookkeeping and thoroughly enjoyed the course it was not easy but i felt that the course notes trainers and assessors were all very helpful my whole experience with open colleges has been positive i would really recommend it to anyone who wishes to improve their skills and has limitations with time a great experience
5,30-01-2019,easy to navigate around site,easy to navigate around site good and timely feedback from assessor
5,30-01-2019,it helps me to be more confident and,it helps me to be more confident and equipped on my chosen path by pursuing my career as an electrical engineer
3,29-01-2019,very average,i found the marking of assignments to be inconsistent and the found that the way some of the questions in the assessments were written could be easily interpreted in more than one way i also foundation plethora of spelling and grammatical errors
3,29-01-2019,it's what you would expect,some times it took a lot longer than  days to recieve feedback for an assessment or an email i was waiting up to  months for an email to be answered for an assessment other times i would get feedback within  days some quizes need to be addressed also i only had one module not save my correct answers when i asked my assessor his reply was that i had to do it all again the others were ok it was what you would expect from an online course very hard to talk to someone over email
5,29-01-2019,open colleges has been great for the,open colleges has been great for the whole eam was very helpful and friendly i would like to say thank
5,28-01-2019,i would recommend this company to,i would recommend this company to anyone that asks me because it gives you all the information needed and the help needed to finish the assessments
5,28-01-2019,a really practical way of education for,a really practical way of education for professionalsi could study at my own pacecould use references from my real jobs as well as applied the learning of the course in my jobi am really satisfied with what open colleges had offered
4,27-01-2019,great course needs more emergency work,great course needs more emergency work though
3,27-01-2019,not a perfect setup but i learned a lot,i completed a certificate iv in professional writing and editing which is now in teachout i found the assessors to be very responsive and encouraging always marking assignments within a couple of days and offering feedbackin terms of the course content some of the links provided were fairly old and others broken i assume they were not updated as the course is coming to an end but it was still a shame the student forum was also a bit of a ghosttown but i don't feel this had a major impact on my studies my main complaint about openspace the online learning environment is that it doesn't notify you when an assignment has been marked so i had to just keep checking backsome of the assignments were quite painful i can't tell you how many times i answered a question about ergonomics but overall the course did teach me a lot about writing and editing and it was great to get feedback from assessors who have realworld experience in the industry
5,26-01-2019,the course was relevant and well,the course was relevant and well structured great student support with promt attenrion to questions
3,26-01-2019,the educational content was very good,the educational content was very good the support from assessors and workplacement support was less than average student support was only average i would recommend others deal directly with universities or tafe colleges i found the study with open college quite stressful
5,26-01-2019,great way to study if you have a busy,great way to study if you have a busy schedule all the support you need is at your fingertips too easy to navigate and access course material and submit assessments would recommend open colleges to anyone of any age or level of experience
5,26-01-2019,cert iv in bookkeeping and accounting,certificate iv in bookeeping and accounting  it has been such a rewarding journey i enjoyed this course immensely and it is only the beginning of my path in accounting such a committed and helpful team without the constant and prompt assistance of all trainersassesors and student support would have been quite challenging i highly recommend open colleges
5,25-01-2019,incredible professional team if experts,thank you team of open colleges without your support i would never have been able to complete my course my assessors were experts and guided me with their constructive feedback throughout the course i would definitely do more courses with open colleges
3,25-01-2019,feedback,some of the assessments had a lot of errors in them the issue with the course changing this week and only giving us  weeks to complete work was terrible and the support to help us pass in this short time was terrible some of the assessors went above and beyond to give helpful feedback and advice so that was great over the  years
4,24-01-2019,did my certificate iv with open,did my certificate iv with open colleges and just finished itcustomer service is very reliable and helpful easy access to course materials and assessments trainers are also helpfulcourse material can be more in depth but if you are willing to do more than requested you did end up learning more some of the trainers and assessors are also more detailed than others they're the one who push you to learn more all and all happy with open college may extend to diploma with them in the near future
2,24-01-2019,study direct through tafeother organisation,i had one perhaps two decent assessors during my experience the community support officer role may as well be made null and void as no support was offered the learning material and assessments were vague in what they wanted of you never again
4,24-01-2019,i loved this course,i loved this course i did find some assignments a bit confusing at times but help is always available
3,23-01-2019,i found the process of not actually,i found the process of not actually having someone to help and point you in the right direction with the assesments hard for example unless u watch a webinar you really have no idea what direction to take and when sending a message to get help they just say the question back to you againi would prefer to do a course next time where there is a physical person to show you how or simply explain things to you  without the webinars available to talk you through it it would of been  times harder although i wasn't impressed that the webinars sometimes weren't available when i began the assesment and would appear after i started
4,22-01-2019,the support team were excellent to help,the support team were excellent to help me to give me advice to solve queriesthe trainers and assesors assisted me to complete this course
5,21-01-2019,great support and helpful staff,i completed a certificate in accounting with open colleges during this time i had an unexpected personal matter arise which didn't allow me to study for a period of monthsopen colleges staff were very supportive helping me with extensions and always helpful with questions that i had and happy to help in any way they could i would recommend open colleges to study as sometimes study online can be challenging but with the support open colleges provide it makes it all the more achievable
5,21-01-2019,i have found my experience to be an opportunity to accomplish what i have always hoped for my future,i have found my experience to be a great journey from the beginning to the end there has always been lots of encouragement from the tutors along the way with very encouraging feedback from my assessors i have learnt everything i expected and found the course learning material to be set out well and relatable to all the assessments this opportunity has certainly made my future something that i dreamed would be thank you open colleges
4,21-01-2019,having studied online before i knew,having studied online before i knew what to expect in general questions answered quickly assignments marked in great timing and the course content great too a few links didnt work here or there i would recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to study online
5,21-01-2019,positive rewarding experience,i would highly recommend open colleges for anyone wanting to complete a course on line  i always received help when i requested and quickly realized that if i didn't get an immediate response that a little patience goes a long way as they are not just dealing with me i believe if you don't ask you don't receive and when i asked for assistance help with progression planning or an extension of time the student support staff were extremely helpful and easy to deal withi will certainly use open colleges again as a mode of study in the future
4,20-01-2019,the course was challenging and the,the course was challenging and the staff helpful when i interacted with them they are sometimes a little slow in marking assessments but not too bad
4,19-01-2019,happy,i took a little bit longer to complete my course than i should have but overall good experience there was a lag at one point in marking assignments but has been rectified
3,18-01-2019,when an assessor trainer leaves open,when an assessor trainer leaves open colleges they forget to tell the students who continue to send emails to a dead end email address without any success and it's not until you ring them that you find out the trainer assessor has left  meanwhile the student waits for a reply that never comesstudents should be made aware that at the end of a course if they needed a first aid certificate to qualify that first aid cert must be current  if it has run out during the course then it must be refreshedrenewed or no certificate diploma etc  a heads up would've been nice instead of having to wait a few more weeks
5,18-01-2019,first time enrolling and studying,first time enrolling and studying online found it awesome to be able to complete the course in my own timeonly thing that i found different from being in class to doing the course online is that emailing the teachers of any questions you may have and waiting about a day or two to get a response which is totally fine since its an online courseoverall teachers were nice and very helpfulone thing for the online content though is that some of the links to external sites were brokenmovedremovedor not found they will need to be checked and updated every now and then though a quick google search and i was able to find the answers
1,17-01-2019,open colleges wasn't a good experience,open colleges wasn't a good experience for me not only was the course material badly written with multiple typos some of the assessment questions were unclear and needed much more detail on what was needed to be completedi had alot of trouble finding placement even after calling and also applying online at every singe possible place in melbourne victoria after being allocated placement by student support i then had to wait  months to complete it and once started it took me  hours everyday to drive there whilst at placement we are given a student portfolio to complete the pages are all over the place making it hard to keep organised and trying to edit scanned documents to get signed and add in assessments was extremely difficult which almost left me unable to be graded multiple timesi felt extremely frustrated with how this course went for me and after talking to open colleges today i am now unable to be graded or receive my certificate because my first aid has expired which wouldn't have expired if this course didn't take so long to complete and student support and my teacher didnt take so long to get back to me i could wait  week at a time to hear back from support overall i am very unhappy with my experience and the setbacks i had
5,17-01-2019,i enjoy really to study  with us gay,i enjoy really to study  with us gay  i had a good time with us  i wants to appreciate all the team in open colleges  and debt  sucess too for have a  good time with me  i will recommend  us  to all the  person who wants to improve his life  in this way because they have a busy life do not have time to go in tafe or public school  i will recommend  us kindly regards the deep of my hartnatyari alfonso munoz  naty
3,16-01-2019,workbook information provided was poor,workbook information provided was poor used google to get most informationhelp was not easy to find had to go to fellow study members
2,16-01-2019,never again,not only are students not notified that there is more theoretical work involved in the work placement assessment process due to us not having access to to that section of open space until all other sections are complete but it was tedious and unnecessarythe whole process of using imaginary patients to demonstrate your proficiency in in performing a skill was redundant when we had already competed these skills within a hospital setting with real patients under the supervision of the hospital employeesthe assessment could have been much more streamlined if open colleges had trusted the organisation that was housing their students and their students rather than being more concerned with themselves being sued
5,15-01-2019,i would highly recommend open colleges,studying through open colleges was the best choice i made they are there to support and help you graduate to the best of your ability i always felt i could ask and talk to the support line about anything and that no matter what they would work with me to finish my course in time the topics in my course were full of detail information that was relavent and clear to understand the assessments where also well set out so i knew what was expected of me and if needed i was given a chance to fix or add to help get the best mark i could i would recommend studying through open colleges to everyone as it accommodates all study types and allows you to work your study within your life
3,14-01-2019,overall happy but the assessments need to be reviewed,overall i am happy with what i have taken away from my course with open colleges  certificate iv photography and photo imaging i gained valuable knowledge on how to conduct myself as a professional and take my hobby and turn it into a businessi did however have major issues with the completing the assessments the main problem that carried across almost every assessment was the confusing way in which they were worded  the level of ambiguity and repetition caused an incredible amount of time wasting and frustration when trying to get clarification from the trainers or just attempting to decode the questions myself this seems to be a problem that many other people who took this course struggled with also almost every day i would see people asking questions for clarification or outright expressing their frustrations on the facebook group or openspace i seriously believe that all the assessments for this course need to be looked at and possibly rewritten to make it easier for those working on them to understand what is being asked of them and to streamline the course as a whole
2,12-01-2019,would not recommend,very expensive for what it is i only chose open colleges so i could study online but now i wish i just did night school instead assignments reword questions to make the word counts higher so half of what youre writing is totally redundant and a waste of time a lot of the links in the content are expired so i guess they havent been updated in awhile when i was on my placement i needed some support but none of the staff responded to my questions so i was on my own to figure things out they also needed to do checkpoints throughout the work placement to pass me but would never call me at the times that were arranged overall a negative experience of me having to chase everything up myself and not being provided with the appropriate support would highly recommend going to your local tafe instead staff were nice enough but it was just super hard to get in contact with them open colleges should hire more staff so they arent spread so thin
3,11-01-2019,i didn't have the best experience,i didn't have the best experience especially with finding work placement not alot of help provided from open colleges during my placement i never received phone calls when i should have and the whole process was a nightmare
5,11-01-2019,open colleges,open colleges provided a high level study of accounting that will assist me in my future roles as an accountant the assessors are always willing to help and provide information when requested the student support team is always available and ready to answer any questions that you may have i will always recommend open colleges
4,10-01-2019,staff excellent website fantastic,i found open colleges staff to be excellent assignments marked on time help if i needed it easy to contact student services i found openspace easy to use and navigate and assignments easy to upload the course itself seemed a little disjointed and frustrating but im not sure that that is open colleges or nsw tafe as a mum the flexibility of no assignment or exam deadlines was fantastic and working at my own pace was perfect overall it was a great experience
4,08-01-2019,quick enrolment times,quick enrolment times friendly staff easy to understand course and layout would definitely recommend to anyone looking to do online learning as there is a wide range of courses available
5,08-01-2019,i would highly recommend this course,i would highly recommend this course the trainers assessors and student support staff are amazing and always helpful encouraging and supportive of students the course itself is very easy to navigate and understand
4,07-01-2019,great support,the course was well presented it was quite easy to find everything on the site and the staff were very helpfulsome of the course material seemed to have changed from when i started the course and therefore i was not getting all the information i needed to do some of the assessments the feedback on assessments was excellent and the assessors were very encouraging overall the course was very good
5,07-01-2019,highly recommended,highly recommended the whole process kept me on track which i have never been able to do the response times of both support and the assessors was awesome thank you for helping me successfully complete my course
5,06-01-2019,selfpaced study,selfpaced study variety of courses helpful staff with quick turnaround
5,04-01-2019,i feel like i have gained so much with,i feel like i have gained so much with a very thorough educational experience
5,03-01-2019,loved every minute of it,such a fantastic course i enjoyed every minute of it and although i could have finished it in half the time that was allocated i wanted to drag it out more the course itself was very easy to navigate through and i found it simple to submit all my assessmentsthe trainers were all so accommodating and helpful i never had to wait long at all to receive advice and helpwould definitely recommend
3,03-01-2019,up and down,in my experience the cert iv in allied health assistance physiotherapy was ok the theory portion of the course was good but i feel that more was needed in terms of exploring mobility equipment the what how and why also there was a lot of content regarding diversity laws policies and procedures which i found terribly dry and mundane anatomy and physiology content could be explored in greater detail also working with the human body is complex even if one is working under the direction of an ahp i believe an aha needs to be well studied in human biology overall the theory portion was good assessments were structured well and format for feedback of assessments were greatthe work placement portion of this certificate was very overwhelming at times the book work required in the  hours of placement is not balanced when completing ones work placement hours in either a hospital or aged care facility attempting to complete both written work and filming  videos whilst also trying to learn as much as possible from your ahp supervisor the work load is unrealistic also finding the time to sit down with your supervisor to discuss all aspects of the book work and videos is also unrealistic time is unfortunately in this day and age of the essence there needs to be changes made to the work placement structure there are too many videos that are required plus uploading these videos to the open space portal took a very long time  i spent more than  hours attempting to upload section b videos and i'm not computer illiterate the positive out of the placement aspect of this course is that i had the support of an absolutely amazing assessor she was extremely supportive gave great feedback and i felt i could openly communicate with her at any stage her support and encouragement was unwavering so to her a massive thankyou overall a lot of changes that could be and should be made to this course but i'm happy i have completed it and am working as an aha in a great facility i feel like i'm making a real difference in people's lives now
5,03-01-2019,excellent course,excellent course easy to follow layout assistance is available if needed it is great as you can study when you have the time assessors very helpful
3,02-01-2019,poor and badly written content within,poor and badly written content within curriculuminadequate responses from trainers and accessors  inability to get information or help within a reasonable amount of timepoor communication from college apart from the initial contact that i instigated to the college for a follow up within the first three months  where i was given incorrect information i actually never received contact outside of marking or by my request in the  months that i took to complete the course  the advised time to study and complete this course is impossible unless you have no life and the information given gives you a false sense of timing in which to complete the course
4,01-01-2019,it great way to learn,it great way to learn but during the course marking was a bit slow in parts so i marked it down but trainers are knowledgable and tuition is available for those struggling

2,01-01-2019,the whole college was just slow,the whole college was just slowresponse times from the college were very slow sometimes i would have to wait  weeks for a response that was urgent my workplace assessor contacted me after my work placement so i had to back to the work placement for my assessment some of the assignments were unnecessary and took forever to complete the staff are nice but they are too overwhelmed with work open colleges need to hire more staff cause to increase their response times
5,01-01-2019,positive and successful experience,i enjoyed the ease with which i could access all my course modules answer the quiz section of each module when required and upload assignments i was always provided with sufficient material to support the study and correspondence always answered promptly course coordinators and assessors were thorough with their helpful suggestions and assistance the webinars also were most useful

5,27-12-2018,support was fantastic from everyone,support was fantastic especially from the support team and the assessors with prompt responses to enquires the comments section also allows you to see queries that others had encounted along the wayhaving a study buddy i think would have been more beneficial for me me  just to keep me moving at a pace and to bounce ideas off however i was unable to link up with anyone in the system having the option to go onto a small group at the beginning of change groups along the way to stay at similar paced students would provide motivation and the opportunity to collaborate and discuss ideas  similar to a class situation overall my experience with open colleges was excellent and i would highly recommend to anyone considering study so proud to have graduated
4,27-12-2018,supportive,good support and helpful with advice and guidance assessors very approachable and helpful and student support always helpful
3,27-12-2018,average experience at open colleges,before going into this course i thought the assessors would be extremely helpful i was wrong throughout the course they gave indirect answers and poor feedback it is very much a self taught course there were many times where i needed more details and information to complete assessments most of the time they directed you to course materials where you have obviously looked at many times they rarely gave direct answers although there were still some assessors who were sometimes helpful and happy to help
5,26-12-2018,good study material,study materials are good tutors are very helpful and responsive the course has really helped me tremendously
1,23-12-2018,i would not recommend my friends to,i would not recommend my friends to study with open colleges unnecessary paper work and no support to find placement delayed my course due to slow marking on assignments no support very rude assessors big no for me i request all new students to find other education providers i been charged double money then other education providers feeling ripped off
5,21-12-2018,the staff were always really nice,the staff were always really nice very helpful and if i didn't understand it the teachers would explain it in a number of different ways the website is really easy to use and the modules are easy to read and understand thank you all so much  holly

5,20-12-2018,it is worth while to know as its,it is worth while to know as its fantastic that youre able to set up a payment plan for the duration of the course but if you  finish early you must pay the remaining amount before you receive your certificate make sure you have a plan and read the terms and conditions
5,20-12-2018,open colleges,open collegeshas got the best qualified educators who are very supportive with experience and professional knowledgethe learning skills and theory throughout the course prepares you  for the real nursing experience out in the work force
1,20-12-2018,bad experience,no good at all their time management is bad no support
4,20-12-2018,it was great support when needed,it was great support when needed but also abit annoying that you cant move onto the next modules without the prior assessment being marked having to call up is all and well but still an inconvenience sometimes
5,20-12-2018,i would definitely recommend open colleges,i would definitely recommend open colleges i had a great experience i was able to manage myself while asking for assistance if required justine was super prompt in marking and a great point of contact
2,19-12-2018,to be honest,to be honest i wouldnt recommend open colleges it was an absolute nightmare both times i tried to organise my work placement i expressed the urgency to have it approved as i was working in a different industry and had to complete it in my holidays assessments take far to long to be marked and my last workplace assessment i wanna assessed for a completely different course i am happy to have now completed my studies with them
5,18-12-2018,thanks open colleges,you can learn anytime anywhere
4,18-12-2018,open colleges was a great way for me to,open colleges was a great way for me to study as i work full time i enjoyed the course and found the site easy to navigate student support where a great help when i needed them and the trainers and assessors were great also the only negative i have to report is the lack of assistance i had with my community placement i completed  hours in a residential setting and all of that went smoothly however i had a lot of difficulty in securing a placement for the last  hours in the community i asked open colleges for some assistance with this and they were more than happy to assist me however the forms that i had to complete were quite cumbersome and at the time i was already feeling very overwhelmed because i was so close to completing my course yet i was having so much difficulty with this last step i am happy to report that i was able to secure a placement in the community on my own and completed my course i definitely would recommend open colleges and in fact i am already considering my next course with them
4,18-12-2018,overall i think studying with open,overall i think studying with open colleges has been great
3,17-12-2018,new to bookkeeping learned something    but not confident,lot of typo errors and broken links  links are to other peoples youtube videos but are slowly building their own training videos sometimes it is difficult to understand what is required  turn around is very long so it is best to submit the assessment even if you are unsure of what is being asked correct the assessment and then resubmit saves weeks of waiting
4,17-12-2018,good job but have to improve with,good job but have to improve with communication with students
1,17-12-2018,i would not recommend open colleges,i would not recommend open collegesthe support i got to pay for the course was greatthe workbooks are not clearthe videos and reading information donot always match whats covered in the workbooks
5,16-12-2018,open colleges was the perfect study choice for me,i found my experience overall terrific there was always copious amounts of support all online content no text books clear instructions and the option for online study buddys i would definitely recommend open colleges to a friend
3,16-12-2018,in hindsight,in hindsight i would not have chosen to do this course online it was very slow to receive any feedback and the majority of the course was simply just going through pages upon pages of coursework  online no longer printed which made it difficult  and answering questions
4,16-12-2018,good standard of education,good standard of education  friendly staff helpful teachers
2,15-12-2018,the education side of my course was,the education side of my course was really good and there were some thing i learnt from it most i already had prior knowledge ofhowever i found it really hard to understand a lot of the assessment tasks the wording on these tasks were not clear and there were lots of spelling and punctuation errors which made it difficult in addition one assessment in partthad huge errors throughout changing the case studies client from a she to a he and putting in a random name in the questioni found it really poor that other students had identified that the assessments were not clear months before i attempted the assessment and though the trainer said they would tell management i found the same errors hasnt been fixed mo this later i also thought that communication from trainers could be improved i really struggled when first doing this course and found that after  months hadnt complete one assessment but also never had anyone contact me to ask if i was going okay that would be something that could be changed in the future
4,14-12-2018,everything was as expected,everything was as expected timely grading of assignments comprehensive feedback and supportive assessors the only reason i did not give a  star review is due to few delays we experienced when one assessor went on leave and some assignments took  weeks to grade open colleges though have issued an update advising us that they have introduced a new process to mitigate this issue from happening again overall a good experience
5,13-12-2018,rewarding experience provided by open colleges,open colleges provides me with the flexibility to achieve my diploma within the constraints of my hectic and ever changing life the support assistance and guidance from everyone at open colleges has been exemplary
5,13-12-2018,one of the best educational experiences of my life,open colleges has proved to be an excellent choice to expand my education and start down a new career path the course work is clear concise and set out in a very easy to understand manner however if you do get stuck at all fellow students are very kind and helpful the trainers are extremely friendly and dedicated to helping and encouraging you and student support is the best professional support network i have ever come across they have answered any and all of my questions and resolved all queries in a remarkably swift timeframe with the loveliest staff assisting me i would recommend open colleges to absolutely anyone
4,12-12-2018,good but can do better,i was happy with online content there were some parts when communication failed i can remember a few failed attempts at role plays mainly due to technical errors and trainer poor organisation on the whole i am happy with the course and i enjoyed it
3,12-12-2018,the study material had multiple errors,the study material had multiple errors both spelling and grammarmany of the quiz questions and answers where ambiguous
5,11-12-2018,i would definitely recommend open,i would definitely recommend open colleges and may even come back for further studiesi preferred this method of learning as it was selfpaced allowing me to still manage my busy lifestyle whilst completing the course
4,10-12-2018,studying with open colleges was really,studying with open colleges was really great for me it allowed me to take my time over the length of the course the trainers and assessors were really helpful
4,10-12-2018,great introduction to horticulture,the course was really complete and i learnt a lot over the last yearthe assessors are very knowledgable and i had useful answers from them anytime i was in doubti think it works well for people who are autonomous and well organised as it's easy to loose track of timei felt a bit isolated and would have enjoyed to have the opportunity to meet with other students that live in my area to help each other
5,09-12-2018,it was a great learning experience,it was a great learning experience everything has been designed to help navigate through every study period the modules are very detailed and with practical scenarios the trainers and the student support team are always ready to assist with any challengemy assessor ean joyce was so amazing i learnt a great deal from his comments and corrections because he always reviewed my assessment word for word pointing what could have been added and still suggesting material for clearer and additional knowledge aside that he will always send you feedbacks right on time he was such an inspiration
5,09-12-2018,good,the course is good
4,07-12-2018,i was very nervous to begin a course,i was very nervous to begin a course again after a few years of only working and not studying so i liked the fact that with open college i was able to do my studies online in the comfort of my home at my own pace the study materials where very helpful with a decent amount of information that i required i found it difficult to adapt with the feedback method of waiting upto  days somtimes it just felt like a long process when waiting for a question to be answered or just to get feedback sometimes when i asked a question to the support trainer there either wasn't an answer or it would be many days later with a response that didn't relate to my questioni had a work placement with my course which was perfectly fine but i wish i was notified when enrolling that i would have to do my placement in a different state as i'm sure open college would have been aware that perth did not have anything available for me to do a placement just having more preparation would have been nice as this was all out of my own expense and all i wanted was to complete my course which could have been impossible if i was unable to go to a different state which would have been a shame with all those months spent studying but in saying that the support i received when i needed help with a placement was amazing the support officer who helped me went above and beyond with sorting a placement in the time frame that was available for me which i really appreciated i had an amazing work placement experience which i am grateful for i learnt so much and this all wasn't as scary as i thought it would have been  so in saying that i'm glad i took the risk to study online and to do my course with open college it was defiantly a positive experience where i have learnt so much
5,07-12-2018,i had a wonderful experience with open,i had a wonderful experience with open colleges from starting with my first course untill graduating my third course last week open colleges platform was easy to use and was very comfortable student support staff have been very supportive and helpful the courses were very practical useful and knowledgeable and i have learned a lot i am a bit disapointed from one of the assessors angie kasper the other assessors were very professional thanks to their guidance and support it made my studying much easier i would recommend open colleges to anyone
1,07-12-2018,never going through open colleges,never going through open colleges againnil help on assignments staff don't talk to each other assignments take too long to be marked complaints go nowhere and excuses made for poor performance can't speak to the lecturer who is training you directly only by email which can take days for an answer course had nil flexibilityjust a poor  pathetic excuse for a course
4,04-12-2018,the video assignments were numerous and,the video assignments were numerous and very stressful to work through the final assessment of work placement portfolio was equally very painstaking and totally irrelevant as menu planning  costing is not a dietary assistants job
2,04-12-2018,started off well but then,started off well but then correspondence became very laboured poor service in one particular assessment that ended up costing me extra money in extension costs
3,04-12-2018,placement problems,i had no problems with open colleges right through the course until i got to the practical component i struggled to find a placement contacting over  speech pathologists in the perth metro area when attempting to get help from student support i was told to 'keep trying' someone eventually helped me by contacting a hospital on my behalf however when i was cc'd into the enquiry email it was basically what i had been sending out myself at this point i couldn't be bothered completing the course i eventually found a placement myself which was over an hour's drive away from where i livewhen i had finished my placement i submitted my work for marking i heard nothing back so contacted the assessor who told me they had not received anything back from my work placement surely you are able to follow this up yourself if you have sent the paperwork i had to follow up with my placement and resend them the questions they had to complete i also had to apply for an extension at this stage because of the lack of follow up from the assessorwhen i eventually got all my paperwork in and was waiting on confirmation that i had completed the course i received an email to say i wouldn't be sent my certificate until i resat my provide cpr as it was now out of date i have no problem with resitting my cpr as i was due to do this for my workplace the problem as i saw it was that when i submitted my certificates for credit transfer maybe it should be compulsory that the cpr cannot be a credit transfer and must be a new certificate as you have to renew this every  months
2,03-12-2018,diploma of accounting not recommended through open colleges,i would definitely not recommend the diploma of accounting through open colleges tax material was out of date and assessment questions are very ambiguous very little support was offered and the grading and assessment feedback was not consistent i did however receive free extensions after complaining the support team that handled complaints and enquiries were very helpful glad the experience is over i will not ever be studying through open colleges again
3,02-12-2018,could be better,good breath of subjects in course content to meet industry requirements however inadequate learning support need to rely heavily on self learning and motivation trainer feedback is only offered upon completion of each assessmentno follow up to check on progress or opportunity for discussion of topics with trainers during course worklag time for responses to online questionsqueries are variableusually within  hrs depending on trainerworkloads but sometimes more than  days would have been much better if you could physically call to speak to a trainer or book an appointment
4,02-12-2018,whenever i had a problem with something,whenever i had a problem with something or a question the friendly staff of open college were quick to help me with an answer or guide me through it i would recommend open colleges
2,01-12-2018,course changed part way through,course changed part way throughonline support slowassessors not leaving notes on systemfinish and passed only to be told a few days later my first aid has expired  but was sent  months prior and was in datetravis was fantastic as an assessor  if it weren't for him i would have thrown the course
5,30-11-2018,tops from enrolment onwards,from the enrolment stage on the phone i had an officer who was polite and explained all information clearly making enrolment simple during the online orientation of my space everything was clear and simple to understand which was handy when i began studying the only matter was that some links to researchread were broken but it's great to see this issue has been resolved open colleges is great and the open colleges online team do their best to assist you i learnt to be patient
4,30-11-2018,great experience to study with open,great experience to study with open collages the student support team is very friendly and helpful the assessors are very professional and providing a great guidance and feedback throughout my study with all those help and support it made my online study much easier recommended to people who has limited computer skills and language barriers don't be scare of studying online here at open collages they have an awesome support team and very helpful
5,30-11-2018,the course was fantastic,the course was fantastic there was always someone there to help and they got back to you so fast when you logged a request or an inquiry about something i would recommend starting here to anyone thinking about it
3,30-11-2018,great course structure and information,great course structure and information delivered well and liked going at own pace and not having any due dates and deadlines takes a bit for assignment marks to come back therefore to be able to move onto next modules but understood with assessor workloads overall a great course with a great outcome at the end
3,29-11-2018,significant time commitment required,i studied a diploma in graphic design through open colleges speaking to one of their enrollment team when i was inquiring about the course i was advised that the course would require at least hr a week time commitment through the duration of my studies i found hr week time commitment a gross under estimation of the time for reading the course material and completing the assignments i complained about this under estimation of study time on a number of occasion and note that the recommended time commitment has been increased to hr week which is more realisticgenerally i found student support helpful and the assessors accessible and attentive i suggest more effective assistance might be provided to students if there is an option for them to book in appointments to speak to the assessors about any assignment difficulties that they may be experiencingthis course has an affiliated facebook group i found about about this through a fellow student not through the course assessors or student support access to this group was absolutely invaluble throughout my studies having access to other students studying the same course definitely added value to the manner in which i approached assignments and made it possible to complete the course requirements without access to the other students completing this course would have been more stressful and less achievablethe course material was below the required standard particularly given this is a study by correspondence course often links to relevant articles and web pages did not work we were directed to read the same specific course material multiple times occasionally i found the assessment quiz at the end of a module was incorrectly allocated making it almost impossible for the student achieve the required pass grade for the quizassignments were generally manageable however more care should be applied to the wording of the questions as i often found them long winded and occasionally didn't make senseat the time when i sought to commit to studying whilst continuing to work full time this was one of the only graphic design courses that accommodated my needs and for that reason i would recommend it to others however in my experience people considering doing this course need to be aware of the significant time commitment required and therefore personal sacrifices that come with electing to sign up for this course
1,29-11-2018,terrible  would give zero stars if i could,the course changed half way through i got no support at all through this change even though i'd wasted a year and a lot of hard work in fact at that time to support staff were incredibly rude and intolerant  then the course changed  there are no longer grades such as distinction etc so there's no motivation to go beyond the basic and the basic is very basic the questions can be answered with google its such a dumbed down course some of the materials supplied are in themselves plagiarised from other sources i will be complaining to the ombudsman and others are offensive because they are so patronising one of the videos about child development were just a bunch of parents talking about their kids they had no qualifications at all they are all american videos taken from a course over there because they keep referring to work they've already done which we haven't and that they'll see us all on tuesday which they won't the quality of the videos was also cringeworthy in some cases inaudible and rambling and almost containing some kind of advertising   additionally the modules are wildly different in the effort and time they require  eg  being half of  so you never know how far you have to go  i also believe this is deliberate because of course they get more money if you need an extension  i have wasted weeks and weeks of leave and precious time with my family unable to progress because my work took so long to mark and the next module was not opened up for me  the links rarely work correctly or they link to incorrect or insufficient areas such as in  and my questions nearly always went unanswered  some of the trainers seemed to try their best and i can imagine they also got no support  the course was painful inefficient basic and terrible quality from start to finish these other reviews must have been posted by interested parties  and when they refer to it being easy thats ridiculous we are supposed to be learning it shouldnt be easy  anyone can google answers  also my work experience supervisor at the council said she would never take anyone from our course again because of the awful procedures  additionally most of the questions were seemingly written by people whos mother tongue is obviously not english they were almost impossible to decider  by the way i got all distinctions before they changed the grading system so i am not writing this because i failed
5,29-11-2018,it had been over  years since,it had been over  years since studying and having never experienced online study i researched my options before undertaking my certificateopen colleges platform is easy to use certificates nationally recognised and the staff have been nothing but supportive and helpful along the way as its self paced i was able to complete my certification in  months whilst working full time and volunteering at my clinic if you put in the hard work they will help you succeed
4,29-11-2018,i have just finished my certificate v,i have just finished my certificate v in interior decoration and i have to say it was a lot harder than i thought it was going to bethe content was good but i did feel that it concentrated more on the interior design side of things more than decorationbeing an older student this was very overwhelming for me most of the way through the course but i got there in the endthe trainers were good and got back to me in reasonable time if i need helpover all good
5,28-11-2018,the materials are helpful and the,the materials are helpful and the assignments are well designed the assessors are professional and helpful it's definitely not an easy course but i find myself learned a lot by going through the course thanks very much
5,27-11-2018,it was an amazing experience,it was an amazing experience i learnt so much and there was so much help along the way
4,27-11-2018,overall very good experience,overall very good experience little improvements could be to be able to see completed and incomplete assessments quickly and in order  quiz results to say pass not high distinction
5,26-11-2018,five stars,five stars  open colleges helped me gain my qualification in early childhood education and i was able to find employment from my work placement  the webpage is easy to navigate  students are supported when it comes to understanding the course material and are given helpful feedback if they are stuck on assessments
4,26-11-2018,worth it,this course taught me so much everything i learnt was valuable and required for my choice of work this course is very demanding and a lot of content and material but so worth it in the end the assessors are wonderful and very helpful sometimes this course makes you want to punch yourself in the face but its all worth it in the end
3,26-11-2018,acceptable,acceptablewhilst i was able to graduate from my course there were issues that need to be addressed  for the majority my assessors were great when i did request assistance and went the extra mile however one of my assessors did not seem familiar with the assessment piece and gave feedback that directly contradicted the assessment instructions  he made this assessment which stated that as a bookkeeper we were filling in for a pa which makes the task completely irrelevant to the course such a drawn out process  there was also outdated learning materials incorrect examples and very ambiguous by the assessor's own admittance assessment instructionsif you are not extremely self motivated  or haven't worked in this industry before i would not recommend this course for you
2,25-11-2018,workload,too much work for a certificate  in early education and care i work in a daycare centre and my boss stated that i was doing the workload of diploma status she also told me that i could have had a pay rise after completing  of my modules by open colleges does not allow this which is very unfair if you need assistance with welfarethe support from the oc staff could have been more clear as well and they could have been more available it was not until they started noticing my complaints that i began to receive support fasterapart from that i did get through the course and completed my certificate  but my experience was sadly not a positive one
3,25-11-2018,i got through but felt frustrated at times,i got through the course ok but felt very frustrated at times for a completely online course it could have been better my reasons are as follows the course notes were hard to follow if you needed to refer to something again you often had to trawl through each page to find it it would be great if there was a search function for each page or even subheadings in the menu the portal was very slow i would have to log out and in again to receive an email in my inbox the large staff turnover made it difficult to work out who could help with my queries a lot of the assessments were poorly laid out some not in order of the steps which made it difficult when you had to follow stepbystep the formatting could be improved as well especially when you had to fill in a table the fonts werent even the same you should tell people who are using apple macs that the myob version they have to use is old i was using a mac when i started and had to switch to a pc because the version was too old and needed to use the newer version as thats what i use at work the  day assessment marking is far too long luckily it only came in for my last assessment but that meant with changes it took almost a month to finish
5,25-11-2018,very easy to learn from,very easy to learn from having studied online before and on campus they offer great learning toolsthe fact that its self paced is great they are also very understanding when it comes to having extensions for your courseall the trainers give you great responses on how to improve yourself and your work and the support they give you is great they really care about your progress and want you to suceed
2,25-11-2018,the trainers are very helpful but the,the trainers are very helpful but the learning material is very minimal and you basically have to teach the whole course to yourself you are only given one text book and basically have the internet to learn the whole course the questions within the workplace portfolio are not worded appropriately for the amount of work required for a satisfactory grading this really needs to be upgraded and improved for a better understanding for the students and the amount of work and detail required for the assessment this also drags the workload out for the student and prolongs the time required to finish this course i think the staff would benefit a lot more if the students work equipment was a lot more clear
4,24-11-2018,the course was set out well and easy to,the course was set out well and easy to use i have already recommended a few people to open colleges as i have tried a few other online courses and open colleges was by far the best it can be hard to get a hold of people sometimes think  days to get a reply to a message is a bit long that if you need to know it right away its not convenient this is something you might be able to fix in the future but over all im happy i did my course though open colleges
5,23-11-2018,very happy,open colleges were fantastic in helping me get certified i had a lot of extensions and open colleges were so understanding very happy
4,23-11-2018,i enjoyed studying with open colleges,i enjoyed studying with open colleges as i like being able to study at my own pace i would recommend more webinars to support the course units as i think this will assist the learning of students as opposed to constant reading
5,23-11-2018,as an adult education teacher myself i,as an adult education teacher myself i find online learning quite a lonely and isolated environment to learn and as i don't do chat rooms or have study buddys etc the connections for me were limited of my own choice but the feedback that i got from my assessors travis hackett  rosan lal and livingston was what kept me on track to finish my course and  i believe without iti may have given it up i so looked forward to opening those little comment boxes in my marked assessments and being affirmed that i was on the right track and all my work and research was not in vainthank you  my journey with open colleges has been extremely valuable and an essential part of redefineing and enhancing my career pathway
5,23-11-2018,a great learning method,a great learning method awesome support
4,22-11-2018,seniorish students will often be,seniorish students will often be challenged by it but i have found that the younger people will be patient to help you get through an issue before one starts to stress over it though it may be small in other eyesit is satisfying to get the rewards update age but also to know that there is a person at the other end of contact with oc
5,22-11-2018,very informative,very informativeeducators provide support when you need it
4,22-11-2018,lots of support from assessors,lots of support from assessors they were very understanding when i had to extend for personal reasons i found it a little difficult to find my  hrs community work placement even though i had contacts in the industry as most of them said theres a lot of paperwork for just  hrs i eventually found somewhere that would take me for the  hours so dont give up if it gets a bit hard
2,22-11-2018,the course material was largely,the course material was largely irrelevant to the industry marking time was totally unacceptable  months and i couldnt wait to get it over and done with
1,22-11-2018,stay away from oc,as a student i felt the assessors were very inconsistent eg always spoke to someone new had to explain everything over and over again received different feedback for the same questions a lot of the online quizzes have grammar mistakes and too many open ended questions that leave us students guessing the structure since i first enrolled has changed several times i assume for the better i have had to put through an official complaint regarding the assessors and as i guess i am not the only student feeling this way i have noticed that about  assessors have since left oc there was no explanation or statement regarding this eithercourse material is incomplete  i completed a veterinary nursing certificate and we learnt no anatomy if you can believe itthere's no ongoing support from oc they don't email or call you to see how you are going for example if you have been inactive for a whilei have finally graduated and even then i had to make sure that they spelled by name correctly on my certificateif you are a strong independent person that doesn't need to be motivated can do a lot of online research has previously been to uni and has done reports research papers knows how to reference and have already secured placement then this is the course for you otherwise stay clear
3,21-11-2018,happy overall but some processes not,happy overall but some processes not very fluid still annoyed that the original document for my first aid course wan't considered proof positive that i had completed the coursei thought insufficient weight given to practical application of cognitive behavioural therapy and practical awareness of alcoholicaddictive thought patters such as black and white thinking personalising rationalising denying and so onsome basic spelling error text appearing twice and poor editing in course material but generally a good course
5,21-11-2018,easy to navigate,easy to navigateeasy to contact for informationvery simple process with ongoing support
5,21-11-2018,i've loved my time with open colleges,i've loved my time with open colleges this is my second time studying online having previously studied with open university and it was far and away the bestdespite a couple of health struggles delaying my progress with the support of the open colleges team i've completed my course and am now beginning my job hunt as a teachers aide the team at open space really made me feel like they cared about me as a person even going so far as to walk me through a couple of calming breathing exercises when i called in the middle of a full blown panic attackthe material on open space open colleges' online studying portal is clear and easily understood and the course modules followed a logical pattern that built on each other allowing me to build on my knowledge as i studied there was never a time i felt lostthanks for helping me find my awesome open colleges
5,20-11-2018,starts for open colleges,open colleges has been an awesome experience for me open space is easy to use and it fit in with my busy lifestyle but the main thing that open colleges has given me is my amazing work placement i was lucky enough to go to fiji in october this year to take part in the fiji project with open colleges and acata this was a money can't buy experience that i was so grateful to be apart of
5,20-11-2018,amazing experiencethank you for your,amazing experiencethank you for your support

3,20-11-2018,it is very difficult to get assistance,it is very difficult to get assistance when required wanting help with a question no response from trainer or assessor for days when a student requires help with that question it should be given before the end of the daytime it takes some trainers to mark students work takes to long
5,20-11-2018,great way to achieve new skills,a great way to study at your own pace with flexibilty and guidance when needed  if you put in the hard work you will get out what you want and to move forward  the chance to gain extra curriculum and understand by studying in the privacy of your own home and having a buddy system in place on hand where you can ask questions to fellow students doing same course  things always take time to achieve so as one needs to have an understanding of the internet process studying ways online when one does then the knowledge is well given and taken
5,20-11-2018,open colleges is very supportive of,open colleges is very supportive of their students finishing their studies they are empathetic to student's needs
5,19-11-2018,i enjoyed,i enjoyed studying through open space they kept me informed of my grades and the your teaching technics made learning easy
4,19-11-2018,isolating,the assessors and trainers were extremely helpful but online study was isolating and drawn out the assessment wasnt written well in order for easy comprehension and steps on how to complete the tasks some of the assessment didnt relate to the course material  so assessor was needed to clarify what was required
2,18-11-2018,poor experience,i had a rather poor experience with open colleges this was primarily due to the delays in waiting for assignments to be marked at times this wait lasted for  months it took a lot of hassling to finally get my assignments marked i also found a lot of the external links in the provided content to be out of date and not working this was not helpful
4,17-11-2018,i had a great experience thank you open colleges,i had a great experience any support staff i dealt with where helpful and pleasant to deal with all trainers gave great feedback and the webinars are super helpfuli would only say that the course material can sometimes have places where it lacked links not working etc but i think that has been improved even since i was completing the early stages i noticed when i went back to research a part of the last assessment so it would seem your constantly onto that tooall in all a great experience thank you
4,16-11-2018,good experience,open colleges were easy to deal with in my experience and any time i needed assistance i received it the work placement in fiji was an amazing experience and made it so much easier for me to complete my hours

2,14-11-2018,the assessor support was very good but,the assessor support was very good although they forgot to mark one of my main assessments and had to rush complete it forcing me to get an extension the assessments also say they need at least a  to pass but i got one point from an out of  question wrong and the whole assessment was withheld also when asking where to find the answer to a question in the assessment the assessor point you to a part of the workbook that has absolutely nothing to do with the topic youre doing the work placement section needs to be more obvious too i was almost finished the theory assessments when i saw that it wouldnt complete the course i had to search the website finding out what i had to do and in a small tab theres a work placement part and there were seven more assessments i had to do in short amount of time
4,14-11-2018,it was really good studying in open,it was really good studying in open colleges the course i need to finish intime was not done by me so thanks for the extension period i got coming to cons  there was a bit delay in the last module uploding assessmentsbesides that everything is fine with that

1,12-11-2018,if i could rate open colleges no stars,if i could rate open colleges no stars i wouldi signed up for a diploma of social media marketing after reading through the course guide and thinking it would be a great addition to my bachelor degree only to discover that all of the course content is just free trial software youtube videos and blog posts from external sources there is little to no original content in this course i made a formal complaint and asked for a refund of the payments i have already made and that was declined but i was also told i now have to pay for the remainder of the course in full i am on a payment plan with open colleges because i couldn't afford to pay for the course up front and yet i am now supposed to come up with the money to pay for a product i do not want or need absolutely disgusted with the way this organisation has set up it's policies to be basically anti student my university was far more accommodating to change of mind and direction i deeply regret enrolling with open colleges currently awaiting the next degrading response to my last email explaining how upset i am as someone with no savings and working as a casual in retail post uni don't study through these crooks go to a real university instead
5,12-11-2018,the support at open colleges was,the support at open colleges was excellent they really want you to pass so they help you to do so no question was too big or small or silly i would highly recommend open colleges if you are thinking of studying for sure
2,12-11-2018,study at your own risk,i would not study here again unless i was already working in the industry and  certain that i would be able to complete the qualification there was little support from open colleges when i ran into problems trying to gain and complete work experience nor when i ran into any other problems the information on the modules was often outdated and most of the assignments required extensive additional research to complete there were a few excellent caring prompt assessors who were the only good thing about this process
4,12-11-2018,open colleges makes study easy as the,open colleges makes study easy as the self paced learning experience is accommodating to anyone's lifeall the members of student support and all of the assessor's are incredibly helpful and prompt when responding to queriesi would definitely recommend giving studying with open colleges a go
1,11-11-2018,it was an absolute nightmare getting my,it was an absolute nightmare getting my certificate through open colleges i never received any help and when contacting student support every person i spoke to had the same i dont carenot my problem attitude emailed faculty never heard back from them would not ever recommend open colleges to anyone if i could  stars i would
5,11-11-2018,im so glad i studied with open,im so glad i studied with open colleges they helped me learn new skills and supported me to finish studying through difficult timesthankyou
4,11-11-2018,great online training infrastructure,great online training infrastructure and helpful correspondence with trainersassessors some minor grammatical corrections needed and some voluntary quizzes contained questions based on learning concepts featured in modules later in the coarse which was a little confusing but easy to use and find answers for quizzes and written projects
1,09-11-2018,not good enough oc,i found that studying with oc to be very stressful due to the lack of communication and help there was little or no support whether you called or emailed and when they did get back to you you had already moved on from that with the help from anoyher student  i haven't studied for years and these experience has made me not want to study again this is just my honest opinion would not recommend oc to anyone ever
3,09-11-2018,needs to an even playing field,needs to an even playing field  only one lecturer marking an assignment  there has been work others have submitted that has been passed and other have had to resubmit for similar
2,08-11-2018,mediocre experience,i had a very mixed experience with open collages  however the cons outweighed the prosto start on a positivemost of the trainers and staff were helpful and incredibly lovely  shout out to jacqui brumm who was by far the best assessortrainer i dealt withi did learn a lot from the content that was providedhowever the cons outweighed the proseven though i did learn from the content provided  i do think it was highly repetitive and do believe the content could have been more detailed and in depth especially based on the fact the subject was on animal carestaff members both trainers and support staff i often found to be rude and unwilling to provide adequate help and especially in a reasonable time frame i understand the amount of student requesting assistance but i paid for course and i expected help when i required it i had a piece of work marked unsatisfactory that was not even mine and i had a student support member undermine me and try to tell me that the work was in fact mine and that i needed to redo the work in order to be marked  this continued until my assessor did confirm the work was in fact not mine to which she profusely apologised for and the work was regraded  in regards to assessments i had to follow up  times on work that took longer than the advertised time to be marked many of times the feedback that was provided offered relevant information however a few trainers provided useless information that couldnt be use to fix or improve assessmentsoverall i had a mediocre experience and i would not use or recommend open collages
5,08-11-2018,they encouraged me lot and  they are,they encouraged me lot and  they are very helpful people
3,07-11-2018,the course materials and information,the course materials and information brilliant the trainers got back to me quickly  the portfolio was ridiculous the amount of work especially with all the videos and photos was just over the top i feel something's would be ok to be signed off by the supervisor the questions wernt clear on what the trainer wanted
5,07-11-2018,excellent,excellent even though i missed the course due date by a couple of of months they still helped me get on track and i got to go is the course to open colleges
5,07-11-2018,my project management course was well,my project management course was well structured and implemented granted there were some technical glitches links dropped out but allinall this has been a great learning experience for meas an experienced architect i found the course trainers very professional and responsive this course has brought me uptodate with current project management processes and structures and i am very appreciative particularly of trainer tracey hickey's attentive and helpful support throughout the coursethe open college support team was always prepared to help and responded in good timei am aware of other students having different experiences with oc but i have to say both the pm team and support team have been supportive and responsive all the way throughcost was not cheap but competitive and i given my background in the construction industry i thoroughly recommend the open colleges platform for this course tracey and jim trainers are second to none in my bookcongratulations to these guys and keep up the good work for those students lucky enough to have you mentor themkind regardsmark louisregister architectps i took this course to brush my pm skillswell worth itgood studying to all who darelearning never stops
3,07-11-2018,great information,great information communication between assessors and students is lackingmore communication between staff and students neededoverall experience good
3,07-11-2018,i found the content relivent but it,i found the content relivent but it also felt like it was being repeated alot especially in the assessments the assessments were always marked quickly however i found help from assessors never happened they never checked in during the course and when an email was sent it felt like the response was not very helpful eg refer to customer service or open space not alot of supportthe customer support team was always very helpful but
5,06-11-2018,i really enjoyed my open colleges,i really enjoyed my open colleges experience  i was given so much support an encouragement from the staff
3,05-11-2018,opinion,i'm so disappointed of this kind of learning
4,05-11-2018,it was really a good experience doing,it was really a good experience doing my course online  and i certainly would recommend any one who works full time and at the same time looking for a a diploma  thanks again to open colleges  i got my diploma
4,05-11-2018,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open colleges i had a lot of help from the assessors and trainers who always answered my messages and helped me when i asked questions the student support were fantastic as well especially when i called up and asked them questions the course is easy to understand and nicely set out the open space is easy to navigate and able to access anytime which is great
3,04-11-2018,the change over is what brought my,the change over is what brought my review down the first portion of my course went smoothly and i felt it was well laid out however it became very confusing during the change over it was impossible to get a straight answer out of any one and pointless trying to ring anyone because you would be on hold for  hours and then be disconnected i am very happy i was able to finish the course without having to do the gap assessments but i can imagine that would have been incredibly troublesome for people
3,04-11-2018,improve access to course info,the course could improve byhaving all links and sites updatednot be as repetitive in having an overview as well as content which overlap unnecessarilyhaving an index or reference system so you can look up things with ease rather than go through the module
1,04-11-2018,open colleges are horrible,not one person i know who has studied with open colleges has had a good experience rude people to deal with and theyre not very helpful until multiple contacts very disappointed with my whole experience if i hadnt paid for the course i wouldve dropped it and studied with a different institute study buddies were the only reason i got through my course but we shouldnt have to rely on each other for help
4,02-11-2018,overall,overall the online experience is quite adaptable in getting used to some instructions can be confusing in completing tasks however the support team and lecturers are fantastic they were always there to explain requirements and willing to assistanswer me with everything i believe this is most important as no system is perfect and they really did a stand out job
5,02-11-2018,recommended to any one is thinking,recommended to any one is thinking to study onlinestudent support are very professional and helpfulall the assessors are very professional and helpfulvery easy to access the materials and resourcesthanks open colleges for all your staff effort
3,02-11-2018,it's okish,overall it was okay to be honest i wish i had chosen another school i realised after starting that i wasn't happy with the lack of information and the super high expectations from oc but after finding out i couldn't get a refund or my payments won't stop coming out of my account i kind of forced myself to complete it i graduated in cert  in animal studies and am now in vet nursing cert  and am pretty much doing the same thing again
5,01-11-2018,i thoroughly enjoyed the course albeit,i thoroughly enjoyed the course albeit it took me a lot longer than i expected given my other commitments  the online platform is a flexible way for busy people to study and really benefited me
3,01-11-2018,when i signed up for my course i,when i signed up for my course i believed i sign up for a certificate  in mental health and aod use and for my first  modules it has those classifications on the assessments then at the end i noticed it was only saying mental health i called up to check and they say that is all i enrolled in that is not true and i am very disappointed in you guys i have the first for modules to prove it and they said i didnt pay enough i got it at a discount and it was  years ago i also applied for a blue card and i had missed a page so blue card people notified you to notify me that i had  days to fix it the first i got to hear about it was when blue card cancelled the application and i had to do it all over again it took too long to get answers to questions and that made it hard im sorry all round i am disappointed with open colleges i want my other qualification please
5,01-11-2018,excellent support team,the staff are very friendly an supportive they go above snd beyond to help
2,01-11-2018,poor support,poor support you left out extremely important information before signing people up only running a business not supporting students on their journey
2,01-11-2018,extremely stressful experience,extremely stressful experience the deadline date was changed three times so rather than at my placeit was stressful time between marking was slow with most assessors and a few phone calls for help we're unhelpful the reason i gave  stars was taking into account that the government and tafe were an issue and the one or two great assessors
4,01-11-2018,great support,i had to wait sometimes but they were so kind i could study very well on this course thank you very much for your great support
2,31-10-2018,slow and outdated,slow and outdatedi regularly struggled during my readings links were often expired and led to nowhere and i would have to go searching the web for the information i needed then modules would be replaced and updated and i wouldn't be informed and would have to find out on my ownthere was also a problem with modules having too much information on one page and when i scrolled through the further down i got on a page the slower the page would move until it was impossible to scroll
3,31-10-2018,initial teaching staff were good,initial teaching staff were good they left and the replacement assessors leaves much to be desired  workplacement portfolio questions needs to be clearer and proofread properly
5,31-10-2018,thank you to everyone concerned,thank you to everyone concernedi found the assessors and course trainer 'chris hosking' very friendly helpful and informative i appreciated their support and feedbacki'm already thinking about what qualification to start nextkind regardslynn murfet
5,31-10-2018,i have thoroughly enjoyed taking a,i have thoroughly enjoyed taking a course with open college they are very supportive eager to help and very relaxed manner but still very professional  with efficiency the course is well written to be able to uderstand and sufficient ti me to compleye it was a fullfilling experience
2,31-10-2018,pros and cons of studying with open colleges,the course is good for people who cannot go to a set site to study on a regular basis you can call student support and get help throughout the week and all the course material is accessible online and self paced but besides that i was constantly calling student support because assessments wouldn't unlock it took me two weeks to upload my portfolio because the uploading site couldn't handle the large files the instructions in the portfolio do not give you alternative options unless you fail your activities the first time and also the staff were always giving contradicting information which caused lots of confusion and resulted in me having to redo my placement studying with open colleges has both pros and cons but in my situation the cons outweighed the pros
4,31-10-2018,communication with all trainers and,communication with all trainers and assessors was very good i found the whole process easy once i got the hang of it all i found all study material was thorough and the assessment process smooth enough to complete and send off feedback was great uploading videos was an issue for me but that could have just been me overall a good experience
5,30-10-2018,the experience has been great,the experience has been great my trainer has been very available and supportive and i have been able to study in line with my preferred method around full time work with access to credit transfer and rpl as applicablethe platform  and material is good however there were minor text and formatting errors in some of the platform text and materials these did not effect my ability to study and learn the content
5,29-10-2018,cert iv captive animals,i was supported by some fabulous lecturers nothing was a drama the content was really interesting the guys at student support were amazing in assisting with course extensions when life threw some curve balls my only disappointment is that open colleges doesnt offer my next course of interest as i would have loved to have continued studying with them
2,29-10-2018,so many technical issues,so many technical issues  very little guidance and next to no help with placement go elsewhere
4,29-10-2018,overall i had a good experience with,overall i had a good experience with open colleges  there were a few issues with communication between trainersassessors and students students are always on email and some of us work full time so don't have access to open space  if there is an urgent need to communicate with a student a phone call would be appreciated especially when it comes to resubmitting assessments before a certain date   there are also some trainers that need to learn to communicate better with students when correcting assessments and giving feedback  they need to learn to be specific in their questions for more information so the student can answer correctly  other than that i had a good experience
5,29-10-2018,very professional and friendly staff,very professional and friendly staff great platform for online study life changing experience highly recommended to all looking for online study
4,29-10-2018,i could study easily wherever i wanted,i could study easily wherever i wanted and got many suggestions to improve my photography i specifically would like to say thank you to ms sarah who helped me a lotthanksshalu
5,29-10-2018,i throughly enjoyed the course and all,i throughly enjoyed the course and all the staff at open colleges are very helpful and professional
4,27-10-2018,i enjoyed the course,i enjoyed the course love going at my own pace i did miss the class interaction and found it difficult to motivate to take part in discussions without the live classroom situation
5,26-10-2018,very good college,very good college  assessor were very nice and helpful special thanks to roberto napolitano from student support and jana nettleship one of the assessor
2,25-10-2018,would not recommend to anyone,would not recommend to anyonevery little support was offered throughout the entire experience with open colleges you really are left to your own devices with no follow ups if you are falling behind or dont look like you will be finished within the allocation course timestudent support will never give you the same answer twice it would also depend who you got on the phone that day they were always more than happy to keep offering extensions as long as you paid for themi did take longer to complete my course as i was working full time as well so i was aware i was falling behind but still not a word from anyone just a generic email each time the course expiry was reached saying sorry you didnt finishany time i did try to contact faculty they were obviously so under staffed that it could takes days to hear back from anyone with your own means of contact through open space which is not ideal if you are in the middle of an assignment and just need some quick adviceif you are looking to study unless you are extremely self motivating and require very little support or communication i would not recommend open colleges at all they truely are just out to sign as many people up as they can lock you into your course fees and then they couldnt care what happens from therei must add some of the faculty i did encounter along the way were kind and passionate but i think their resources were so far stretched they couldnt possibly offer sufficient support to each student
3,25-10-2018,cert iv in vet nursing,the course itself cert iv vet nursing has been okay the assessments were fine but the feedback was rubbish  oftentimes assessors would not even read my answers and immediately ask for a resubmission when i've actually answered correctly there's alot of reviews speaking about time waiting for marking i personally haven't had this issue in fact sometimes the assessors are too quick and don't read carefully your answers theory assessments have too many spelling errors and ambiguous questions with no real guidance and don't get me started on the portfolio it's much better since they separated it into two folios but the workload is absolutely excessive and half this stuff could of simply been assessed throughout the course or by doing a day visit to my clinic and watch me perform the tasks this is coming from someone who works in the field and has done a higher degree bachelor's and i didn't even have this workload at university there's been a changeover of staff and i rarely have any idea who to contact and the student support online form is absolutely useless  you never get a response and it's obviously not manned at all i'm very close to completing my last folio and finishing the course yet i have no direction as to what happens next when is the final report marked what happens with the certificate is it mailed or emailedas usual left entirely on my own with no info this course definately needs work and the folio needs an overhaul i highly recommend students looking to enter this course  are working in a clinic because placement is impossible to find even with the assistance from the college  be warned the folio is a huge waste of time and will be extremely discouraging and difficult to complete  you are on your own and will have basically no support best of luck to those students currently studying and i hope you all graduate because you earnt it and you deserve it
2,25-10-2018,before signing a contract with open colleges read the fine print,before signing a contract with open colleges read the fine print i was about  modules into the graphic design course when i realised that it was  not the right fit for me i tried to cancel the remainder of the course but was told that i would need to pay the full fee based on the contract i signed  is a lot of money to just throw down the drain so i completed the course with much resentment the course itself was average most of the training is based on links to other websites and many of those links are broken when i finally completed the course i did not even get an email to let me know what would happen next no congratulations or even  information about when i will receive my diploma honestly i feel like open colleges just wants your money and i would not recommend them to anyone
5,25-10-2018,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open colleges and would recommend them to anyone
2,24-10-2018,open colleges review,the first part of the course was great all the different subjects throughout the study periods and assessments were great but then the portfolio was awful it was like the standard went from anyone could do it to the vets who had done yrs of uni couldnt even answer questions in it correctly i resubmitted three times each time taking three months to mark and everytime there was different comments on questions or more questions they didnt deem correct in the end most of the answers i gave didnt have anything to do with the original question there are no guidelines as to how to present the portfolio so i was required to redo numerous photos and videos because my face wasnt in them which is difficult in a small busy practice as no one has time to film me during a surgery in the end it was over three years until i was finally told i had passed and then another months until i received my certificate
1,24-10-2018,would not recommend,the course work was unnecessarily excessive was obviously not proof read and was  incredibly repetitive staff would take a ridiculously long time to reply to emails making it hard to get the support and assistance you needed to get through the assignments and when the transition began everyone would tell you different things so no one knew what was going on i would not recommend open colleges to anyone
4,24-10-2018,open college is good but the work load,open college is good but the work load was to much i learnt a lot all thrumy studies but if there something that i would suggest is  to to minimise the work load  especially those who are working already in the industryportfolio is too muchbut still i did it
3,23-10-2018,cert iv,i am wholeheartedly happy with my assessor he was thorough and gave feedback in a timely fashionthe course itself was fine but at times confusing i had to chase up issues a number of times and in the case of uploading videos they were lost unable to load then found then lost and took  days and  phonecalls to finalise them getting to my assessorthe  wheel was great such a great goal yet i only ever got to  and yet i had finished what a pity i so wanted it to say  ad i would know i'd finished and then some indication that the certificate was comingthe team at phone support were great on the whole one snippety fellow once but i guess that's lifei was given the wrong assignment to do once and wasted  hours of my omg precious time which caused me a complete meltdown as to the inefficiency of the online coursethere isn't much help really with the work and i feel for those who find study harder than i do
4,23-10-2018,positive experience,overall a very positive experience for me i feel that i have learnt a lot throughout the course and i am a lot more confident now in how i will respond in any given situation or circumstance using the methods and courses of action taught throughout the various modules trainers assessors used positive encouraging language with their grading of assessments and were helpful with pointing in the right direction if any answers were incorrect student support were also helpful whenever i needed them which luckily was only on three or four occasions
2,23-10-2018,o accounting course  should have gone through tafe,o i did the certificate iv in accounting despite years of experience in accounting work i found the course materials difficult to get through due to numerical errors in the course materials and poorly written vague and ambiguous wording of the questions in the assessment tasks it seems that a lot of the materials are distributed without being checked for clarity grammar and punctuation errors these errors led to days spent answering a question one way only to be told they were asking a completely different question student message boards show that i'm not the only onethe subject matter is straight forward enough the way it is presented to the student is notsome assessors were dismissive of my questions when i asked for clarificationnot worth the money go to tafe instead

4,21-10-2018,it was a great learning experience and,it was a great learning experience and i'm so glad i chose open colleges it's likely i'll return for further study
3,21-10-2018,good but could be better,in terms of learning my experience was great i learnt a lot from the materials and assessments given however the support side of it was lacking in some ways there was no ongoing support like checking up and notifying me of any outstanding assessments especially when my course expiry date was approaching
5,20-10-2018,the support  offered to me was,the support  offered to me was tremendous
3,20-10-2018,feels almost unprofessional sometimes,i haven't spent much time in  open colleges but so far it feels almost unprofessional and not in a good way yes it has plenty of good points but the bad points really leave a mark tutorials are really disorganised and i found doubles or even missing tutorialsas for communication it was rare i needed to ask a question which was great but when i was pushed onto someone else who answered me like a bot they didn't answer my question and when i tried explaining this i got no responseotherwise things seem to be laid out fairly clearly and i've managed to get through with little communication that i'm not sure is good or bad
2,19-10-2018,nothing is on your terms,so hard to get a response when i had a question regarding an assignment at one point it took  weeks to unlock a module because it was not ready yet there could be an extensive wait period for an assessment to be marked  which held up the next module being unlocked and there was no assistance given in my search for work placement after several knockbacks there was no activity on my profile for an entire  months and not once was i contacted to see if there was an issue they were more than happy to offer an extension however at a costthe pluses met great people on the fiji placement  oh and i graduatedthe last worst thing i must note though for those people who like to feel a sense of achievement is that the little progress meter that goes up when you successfully complete an assessment never reaches  youll get to  but never    its left me feeling a little incomplete and like i still have something to do
5,18-10-2018,i enrolled at open colleges for a cert,i enrolled at open colleges for a cert  in electrotechnologyfrom my experience i had no problems with the staff both messaging and over the phone the marking was quick and the feedback for incorrect responses was always well written and explained where you went wrongthe payment plans are pretty cool for those who can't fork out a large amount of money straight away pretty simple and easy to complete my coursewould look at doing future study through open colleges

2,18-10-2018,certificate  in captive animals complaint,heywhen i first started this course i soon came to realised well it was completely different to what i had expected not in a good way not only were the theory based assignments pretty repetitive they also were marked in a unprofessional way if an assignment wishes to have photos or figures please state this in the assignmentsecondly the time frame for markers to give back our assignments is also terrible i understand at the moment they're is a current transition between the old and new cert  however in order to progressively do this you should have hired more staff or atleast given everyone more time i was waiting for around a  to  weeks for my portfolio to be marked why did it take so long well for starters lack of staff secondly you clearly state in the portfolio that we are allowed to upload all video ls via youtube or dropbox please do not change this and not tell anyone i was unaware so when i posted my assignment it had to be resubmitted therefore causing more delaysin all honestly i will never sign up to another open colleges nor would i recommend you as an education platform the only reason why i continued with my study was that at the end of the day i want to work with animals and i found a really good workplace that i absolutely adore

4,12-10-2018,good content,good content good turnaround time on marking and support i just feel like there was a lack of effort on wording in assessment criteria  there were often typos or assessments that didnt make it clear what was required overall though happy with my course
1,12-10-2018,what a disappointment your webpage has,what a disappointment your webpage has becomewhat once was the best webpage to search for a qualification and read further information for prospective students is now a disservice to your business as it became too hard to print a brochure without providing you my details for you to harass me  you have removed our ability to search for coursequalification information and assist young australians to make better informed decisions when signing students up to your courses and qualifications  as a national provider that recommends students to your business our organisation with over  offices around the county will not longer refer potential students to your organisationyou went backwards in your service
1,12-10-2018,open collages was such a utter disappointment,open collages was such a disappointment compared to my friend whom studied through tafe and other companies i did so much more workthrough tour all my assignments i was asked questions over and over in didnt ways then it was time for my prac at my work and boy they wasted my time it took  weeks for them to find someone to assess my and inbetween this time i called almost everyday and they couldnt give me and answeri finally got a lovley lady on the phone and she told me that open collages only have one assessor in the whole of qld to assess early child care the amount of times i contacted open collages to find out answers and to not have a call back or a follow up email was ridiculous to finely get them to contact me i had to put a formal complaint in i am now waiting on my diploma in the mail and im not holding my breathand may i add it is not just me i have a few girls at work how have gone through open collages and had so many problemsnow lets get to the cost of there courses i payed near  to do a diploma in early childcare at tafe it is    why did i get ripped off when starting my course i was naive to think that the course would be the same price know matter whom your went throughi am so utterly disappointed and would never recommend open collages  what a rip off save yourself the money

5,11-10-2018,great support,great support financially viable excellent learning materials  helpful administration would study with open colleges again in the future
3,11-10-2018,good and bad with a lot of self motivation required,overall my experience with open colleges was both bad and good i graduated my course although did struggle with timeline and had to apply for many extensions that was mostly my fault so i would not recommend this provider to someone who is not self motivated and doesnt ask for help easilyin the end i was frustrated with changes in course material as it delayed my finishing although i can see the benefits for future students i also wished there had been a clear information on how long to allow for marking of final and large assignments if i had known it would take  months to complete this section i would have been more proactive to get it completed with sufficient time for resubmitsin the end i put a lot of my success in finishing down to one of the trainers who helped me with timing and communication through the final parts of my course
2,10-10-2018,without the trusted support abd,without the trusted support abd gyidence of chris veness i wouldn't have made it through to the end my overall experience was that the selfdirected learning left so much to be desired and the online material was at the time of my studies insufficient at worst and  mediocre at best my online learning and facilitation was reduced to borrowed youtube videos from the us google and wikipedia resources assignments and overall experience of the subject matter was quite convoluted and poorly structured if it wasn't for chris and kathryn who helped me and in the end melissa i would have walked away long ago i've lost time energy and money that i'll never recover but hopefully with my cert  i still have something to show i endeavor to complete the diploma at a local university for a better experience
1,10-10-2018,absolutely pathetic service,i found the whole process very very poor i would call my trainerassessorworkplace assessor and there was not often an answer we made appointments and she did not call me on the dates agreed oni found the being locked out of quizzes when not getting  pathetic and infuriating the question looked like they had been written by a child there were spelling errors everywhere they contradicted themselves to the point that they didn't even make sense i had numerous people read themmy experience was pathetic and i am not the only one who has all these complaintsvery poor service for such an expensive courseit has now been  weeks since i finished my course and after an email and a phone call about my certificate that i need for my work i was informed it will take another  weeks to receive absolute rubbish wouldn't recommend them to anyone and others at my work place who are doing the course say the same

4,09-10-2018,i was looking forward to starting my,i was looking forward to starting my marketing diploma  after a slow start i was able to pick up the pace a bit and despite a few hurdles over the next year was able to run to towards the finish line  and made it short of breath just in time  thanks to the crew at student help i was able to complete the course last week  yay what i didn't like was starting with the goal of a diploma rated course and finishing with a statement of attainment  what is that  i feel like i've only gained half of what i set out to achieve now and i'm not sure how the soa will be received in the job marketi hope my doubts are wrong on both counts

4,07-10-2018,great course,great course some downfalls were that some of the content didnt match up and links provided werent updated and therefore could not be used it was also frustrating that getting feedback from others was a part of the assessments being a stay at home mum and not using social media meant that i had to wait to get feedback from other people doing the course or from teachers and often the feedback wasnt enough information to help with the assignment the feedback system following assessment was great and so was the availability of assistance from teachers and accessors
5,07-10-2018,i would sign up again with open,i would sign up again with open colleges the assessors were helpful the website was easy to use and the course content was well planned and interesting i would highly recommend open colleges
3,07-10-2018,open colleges review,i have had nothing but positive experiences throughout most of my open colleges experience finding my way through open space and online orientations was easy access to endless course material and resources helped tremendously with my study friendly phone calls and support from trainers were what made my studying experience so much smoother than i expected however when it came to submitting my portfolio there were some issues firstly i was not able to submit my portfolio due to the size of my files that was okay i simply posted it in the mail yet i was discouraged to find out at some point my portfolio had been misplaced which i worked so hard on nevertheless my portfolio was found graded and passed so all was resolved at times i felt communication was a bit of a grey areaalthough as mentioned my time with open colleges was a positive experience with only a few hiccups along the way i appreciate the time and effort the assessors provide to their students and i look forward to continuing my studies with open colleges

1,05-10-2018,i would never recommend studying a,i would never recommend studying a certificate  in veterinary nursing to anyone through open collegesi started my course in may  in association with working in a veterinary clinicas i progressed and obtained a full time position at a very well respected multiple clinic business it became apparent that the requirements for this course are far from what would be required of a level  veterinary nurse hours of placement one day a week is what a lot of people receive intially is not nearly enough experience to be a competent nurse in all the areas required of you both knowledge base and practicali completed my  hours after only  months of beginning the course that is not enough also the course content is lacking for the terribly worded questions in each assement confusing and unnecessary in many circumstancesin this industry if you are not competent it is dangerous for both yourself and your patient and will also shatter your confidencein comparison to aas  this course is unsatisfactory and requires serious changes and improving of standardsi finished my course  weeks ago and still have not received a congratulations from student support i had to chase up my graduation and still have not received formal confirmation of completion im seriously disappointed after all that money out of pocket my time and major effort studying whilst working full timei called sudent support on monday and was on hold for  hours i later informed the mainland had a public holiday this was not the case in tasmania and there was no message service to indicate this the phone just kept calling like someone was going to answeri now am still waiting for confirmation and then have to wait  weeks for my certificatei spoke to a lovely gentleman this afternoon whom is chasing my formal graduation confirmation however i am still left frustrated and disappointed with open collegesi know i am not alone and this is causing a severe under rating of open colleges many clinics in tasmania are put off by open students in this industry which is affected job opportunitysomething needs to be donei can only hope i will finally receive my formal notifcation soon
5,21-10-2018,diploma,i recently completed the rpl process to complete my diploma in community services open colleges acknowledged my previous study in community services and my many years of work experience in this sector the rpl was a tough process with the assessor thoroughly testing my knowledge covering all the criteria  to a assure my competencies in all the required elements i am grateful that my assessor was extremely supportive and knowledgeable it's great to finally have recognition for the level of work i have done for many years

2,26-09-2018,practical classes are needed,unfortunately this set up does not work very well  trying to study through the internet and communication via emails and arranging phone calls was not practical and very stressful for methe work booklets and assessments online were okay perhaps more videos or recorded lessons created by the college would work a lot better instead of so much written stuff i highly recommend practical classes to incorporate with the study toothe portfolio was impossibly hard to complete due to there not being any proper connection with work placement and what was required in the portfolio a better system needs to be in place to insure the students are getting the correct practical experience and are more open to opportunity in the clinic that will benefit there studiesthe college was helpful in giving me more and more time and continual extension options to amend my work however it does get to a point where stress overpowers your ability to think clearly and in this case a break or credits towards continuing my study later would have been more appropriate for my health and learning ability having that clock ticking all the time does not put you in the right head space
5,26-09-2018,completing a course online requires,completing a course online requires commitment and dedication  to enable me to do this i found the support at open colleges both via email and telephone excellent  course instruction was good webinars fantastic overall a very good experience

1,25-09-2018,don't do it to yourself,if you want even a half decent education don't consider open colleges they seem to have gone out of their way to make their course as confusing and unorganised as humanly possible and none of the staff can or will help you

2,24-09-2018,review,questions worded poorlyvague questions wanting specific answers a lot of time required from other staff members in work place to help with videos a lot of time having to edit and put videos together some tasks in workplace not covered in course enough
2,24-09-2018,to be honest i found the course,to be honest i found the course difficult not because the content was hard but because the way it was run read this information and answer questions sometimes not even relevant to what had been given in the content i found the trainers not very helpful when i had a question wasn't often the problem was never addressed and given some round about answer that didn't make sense google helped me more then the trainers did
1,24-09-2018,stay away,i found the whole experience with open colleges frustrating and at times unethical the course itself was interesting and informative and many of the trainers seemed lovelyhowever the lack of ongoing and useful support was shocking on the discussion board where we are mean to receive support we often received cut and paste messages saying 'good question contact your trainer about that one' but then when we went to contact a trainer a response could take daysthe phone support too was really bad often the phone operators were unable to help or had literally no idea what to tell you especially when the course suddenly went into the transition period the online support email also never worked when i sent general support questions to 'student support' i received an automated response telling me the question had been received i would get an answer within  hrs i never did to any of my queries in the end the only way i got answers from anyone was to email three different people at a time with the same question and mention that i was keeping a written record of thingsnow for the worst bitthe course that was meant to be  months long that i paid for up front was suddenly changed i was given notice on august th that i had two options  complete all my work placement and assessment by sept th rather than april the following year or   transition to the new course and have to redo four modules that i had already spent hours completing as well as gap tasks and gap assessments this cut  months off my course with a month's noticemany students who were struggling to balance work family and this course just gave up i know as i created my own student support facebook group for the course due to the actual lack of real supportwhen i was madly trying to get all my assessments and work in by the new deadline the communication and marking time wasn't sped up as it should be when we suddenly have only a month rather than  months rather we were told marking would now take up to  days rather than  due to the trainers being inundated with student work of course they were as everyone was in a panic more trainers should have been hired due to the course change to help students get across the lineand more notice should've been given to everyone about this course transition in my view open colleges should not have been able to accept new students in may when i enrolled if they knew a course change was occurringreally really disappointed with my experience i hold nothing personally against individual trainers who were mostly lovely but the organisation itself needs to be held more in account hire more staff and communicate properly with your students the support you promise when we sign up is not there
1,24-09-2018,terribly written course material,terribly written course material massive delays in marking assessments only positive is that the assessor was a nice guy

4,20-09-2018,oc are really supportive and helpful,student support wereare really supportive and helpful in every way assessors and trainers responded to queries promptly and give heaps of feedback on assessmentsthere can be some parts of the course material which can be challenging but with a little time to think on it give it a google and would figure it out eventuallyaside from the course material i have learned a lot about my own selfmotivation and time managementi've completed the cert iv in accounting and continuing with the diploma
3,20-09-2018,open colleges support team provide,open colleges support team provide excellent service and are always courteous and friendlyi think a review of reasonable response times for student enquiries is needed i had some very frustrating waits for trainer responses i don't think it's reasonsble to have to wait over a week for a trainer to reply to requests for information or assistancein saying that the trainers were always very helpful and professional
5,20-09-2018,i decided to study for a diploma of counselling,i decided to study for a diploma of counselling with open colleges and i am so glad that i did what an incredible opportunity i was returning to study after  years and found the course content easy to navigate and very user friendly i was able to study around my family and work commitments i even got to do my work placement in fiji which was beyond amazing thank you open colleges for making studying so accessible

4,19-09-2018,overall my experience with open colleges was excellent,overall my experience with open colleges was great except for a few discrepancies found in the course material especially when downloading the pdf versions compared with the online versioni found a lot of activities were missing in the pdf versions
2,18-09-2018,unsatisfied with student support,the course that i am doing is going to benefit me for my future career path but unfortunately the student support is very hard to try and contact and get the help i need especially when i have been trying for a few months about something important to complete my course but have heard nothing back just recently i might not be able to complete my course because i can't do my work placement as student support never got back to me and when they did they said it would take  days to approve when i was already booked in to start my placement and as i live in a country area cannot complete in my home town and have taken time off work paid for accommodation and travel costs and still they cant process my paperwork as everyone i am dealing with is conveniently on leavei can't leave the course now as i paid upfront not weekly and whether i complete the course or not they have my money
5,18-09-2018,overall very happy with my experience,very good online portal to assist with progressing through the course easily  the workload was reasonable and the trainers and support staff were all very helpful if i needed any assistance  really enjoyed the course
3,18-09-2018,if you need your hand held to study or,if you need your hand held to study or want very clear instructions step by step then this is not the course for youa lot of self interpretation required  plus a desire to learn on your own im not  sure the course is really up to date but at the end of it i do feel like i learned a lot just not sure if it is enough to get into the industry
5,18-09-2018,all l can say is positive about open,all l can say is positive about open collegesi had been out of date with studying and found the tech side a challengeall l got was good advice understanding and help to keep goingif you communicate how and what you need all at open college listen and respond accordinglythank you open college
4,17-09-2018,some of your assessors need more,some of your assessors need more experience in the real world and less by the book marking  otherwise very happy with all the help i received while doing my course
4,17-09-2018,my review,very convenient but i'll say that communication via online and can be quite slow however calling does seem to speed up the process of things overall my experience at open colleges has been pleasant
5,14-09-2018,i had no problem with my experience,i had no problem with my experience i found everyone very polite and willing to help me what every i had a problem with
2,13-09-2018,not worth the money,not worth the moneywhile i completed this cert  with good results i feel as though this was a huge waste of moneyproblems within the curriculum ranged from errors missing information and broken links to spelling mistakes and not being able to upload the final assessment through the websiteadd to this the impossibility of getting in touch with trainers and having to wait for several days to over a week for an answer to any questionin one incident i had to contact the course director to achieve satisfactioni will say that i can compliment the student services area every contact i had with them was handled extremely competentlybut if you are looking at any fashion design related course go to a tafe
5,13-09-2018,great course and very helpful staff,great course and very helpful staff made it a rewarding experience
4,13-09-2018,overall,overall happy with open colleges
2,13-09-2018,do not study online,studied certificate iv in information technologyopen colleges provided flexibility for my course time and had no issues with course extension when required calling student support was easy and they seemed helpful at timeshowever the material was often incorrect and out of datethe windows intune section was appalling at best my own teachers were not able to instruct the best way to complete it and it had to be elevated to much higher authority i ended up solving it with external help as noone at open colleges could assistfurthermore in the final work placement with the server setup the commands provided to input in ubuntu terminal were incorrect to the point that they were actually backwards the instructions are just youtube videos from  years ago that no longer hold any merit in this ever evolving field of technology open college material didn't explain why we do thing they only gave instructions on exact commands to complete the task with no explanation of the commands themselves what they do how it works or why we use it and even these commands and steps were incorrect and had my workplacement supervisor scratching his head in disbelieffurthermore teachers often don't respond to questions and required help for at least  days my workplace assessor didn't respond to anything on open colleges website and insist you email him directly which he took upwards of  business days to do so this is the main reason students fall behind and seem to not be able to catch up often their help is just as generic an answer as they can give supported by we encourage you to solve this on your ownlooking for work placement was a goddamn nightmare which open colleges provided no help for even though they said they would when i applied for their assistance they responded with just look yourself us helping you is a lengthy process that takes several monthswhen i did attend work placement my open colleges workplace assessor was supposed to contact me every day to see how i was going and to assist me in any way he could i did not receive a single phone call email or private message of this at all leaving me to feel unsupported by my coursethe work placement booklets are a mess they have  booklets of the same exact thing and if one of them is incomplete you will fail there is no guidelines to tell you which booklets you need to complete or how you are to complete them  booklet is the outline of activities you need to complete  booklet is signatures from your assessor saying you have completed that activity and  booklet is your comments on the activity after you have completed them how hard would it be to just merge this into  book and on the subject of the booklets why do we need to do a million authentications of our work i can understand  authentications but  on the most ridiculously typical tasks that a  year old can achieve you're out of your goddamn mindsand just to cap it all off the amount of spelling errors incorrectly punctuated paragraphs and sentences lead to the overall feel of the course to be both cheap and unprofessionalonline study surely provides flexibility but you sacrifice both quality effort and any support promised to you and it will leave you in more stress and anger than you would have ever thought
4,13-09-2018,absolutely positive experience,absolutely positive experience my personal suggestion for improvement is sometime about more accurate and clear explanation for units and assessmentsd
4,13-09-2018,learn at your own pace,an open colleges course is for anyone who wishes to advance their education at their own pace the trainers and assessors are very encouraging and provide great feedback one downside is the course notes need to have an overhaul spellcheck and contain more information for this style of online learning
4,12-09-2018,great experience at open colleges,i really enjoyed my course  the course material was very impressive my course went smoothly without major hiccups the reason for four stars and not five is that the turn around time of some of the assessments were to long  especially if it's not satisfactory yet  other than that i will study with open college again in the future  the assessors and support staff were always very helpful and friendly  thanks for a great experience open colleges
2,12-09-2018,this practical course would have been,this practical course would have been good if it had a component where you could actually see the teacher in the same room with you to help with the sewing work that you were doing  i found it toooooo hard with just the videos and communicating with the teacher by questions and feedback  i needed much more
5,12-09-2018,all staffs,they will easily assist you on the things you are in doubt
3,12-09-2018,like everything there are advantages,like everything there are advantages and disadvantages i think the course material is very basic and some of the trainers appear to be just going through the motions in marking i would have liked more critical feedback on what i actually designed many of the assessment tasks in my opinion are irrelevant to the career as in the interior designers wouldn't be doing this so why are you asking us to answer these types of questions and stupidly repetitive in relation whs i think it would be great if there was more face to face lectures through skype or even through facebook live streaming the assessment tasks are generally very poorly written and often confusing as to what's being asked of students i was thankful somebody set up a facebook group independent of open college for students to help each other out as the course trainers were often too slow to reply and sometimes gave cryptic advise
5,11-09-2018,course was easy to get through and,course was easy to get through and feedback given on assessments were very helpful
2,11-09-2018,outdated poor quality diploma materials,i have had nothing but trouble with my diploma early childhood education and care materials which are extremely repetitive rely heavily on broken or outdated third party links and have assignments which are unclear and out of touch with the real world the student discussion boards are filled with questions and comments from frustrated students trying to access things that don't exist and receiving the same 'sorry' reply in return  some of these are repeated for yrs and the same pathetic response is provided over and over again with no noticeable improvement on qualitytheir staff are nice but unable to do anything as there appears to be no review structure few senior staff who actually take responsibility and a total lack of logic within their flimsy course structure when i brought the problem of the broken inks to their attention they actually asked me to go through the materials myself and send them a list of all the links that needed updating isn't that their jobthe material i paid thousands for seems to just be a reference list to other people's work and nothing is actually written by the people at open colleges they appear to just 'copy  paste' sections from other websites and then paste the link for you to go and read it again  a total waste of time for everyone i question where the money actually goes and what i really paid for as it definitely wasn't for the production of a real world well structured or engaging educational experiencei would never recommend open colleges to anyone  use another supplier there are plenty out there
5,11-09-2018,fantastic comprehensive practical,a wonderfully comprehensive course covering broad needs of a teacher aide in today's schools i am equipped with knowledge and experience to deal with any situation in a school environment and have built the confidence to support those students with special needs help and support is always on hand when you need it terrific
3,10-09-2018,great course content but long grading wait times,the course itself is great and i have learnt a lot and feel as though i have definitely learnt and been tested with the content to deserve my certificate iv the major downfall of the course is the long marking time for the portfolio there are people submitting portfolios after people and receiving their feedbackgrades quicker which isnt acceptable
5,10-09-2018,convenient learning for a busy,convenient learning for a busy professionalalthough there was a bit delay in giving back feedbacks to the assessment they were fair in extending the course duration
3,10-09-2018,turn around time for grading system to be reviewed,now after working in my new career that i have obtained whilst working to complete my course the course material is somewhat relevant but a lot of things are missed and you do not learn this from an online coursealso the whole grading system of the final portfolio was a ridiculous amount of time turn around my first submission took  months to grade and then   months the second timein between this i also had to then pay for  or  extensions so i could finish my course which i think is a bit harsh seeing i paid a lot for the coursei would recommend open colleges to others as the convenience of online work is fantastic but the grading time frame is not
1,09-09-2018,worst course ive ever taken,worst course ive ever taken no help finding placement and it takes weeks to get an assignment marked or to even hear back from your assessor and the wording in some of the assessments is poorly done i would not recommend this course to anyone
4,08-09-2018,open colleges,open collegesthe treatment and marking was fair with great guidance to help achieve highest marks
2,07-09-2018,never could get hold of assessors,never could get hold of assessors marking took way too long and cost me extra for extension because of thisassessor not reading portfolio properly asking me to include certain info when it was already theretake too long to respondquestions in assessments very broad  assessors then get you to answer things that arent even in line be with the questionoverall horrible and bad experience
2,06-09-2018,i found it very frustrating as i had,i found it very frustrating as i had little support and when i did ask for help it took days even weeks for answers which didnt help what so ever also the site was constantly closed for maitanence which meant there were weeks on end when i couldnt complete any of my course
5,06-09-2018,great experience and easy to use,smooth onboarding friendly staff and very helpful
5,06-09-2018,my study experience with open college,hi i am really happy with open colleges i had such wonderful learning experience with  open colleges for the last few months i am already looking forward to do some more carrier development courses with them  my course coordinator assessor all were really helpful and appreciative thier encouragement made it easy for me to complete  the course after going through a lot of personal difficulties just a small thing i would like to mention is that at a certain stage i felt i didn't get proper outcome for my assessments as per my point of view from certain asseesors but the assessors are not working with open colleges any more so i don't  have anything negative to say at last i would like to thank everyone at open colleges especially to my course related every single faculty members  i wish all the best to open colleges with their amazing work for students like us thank you
5,06-09-2018,i loved doing my course,i loved doing my course  very supportive thorough
5,05-09-2018,i loved open colleges they were amazing,i loved open colleges they were amazing and so helpful with throughout my course
3,05-09-2018,lack of support but definitely getting better,my experience with open colleges started horribly i felt like i had no support and when i called student support would give me other numbers to call and the cycle kept going until i gave up i had one phone call at the beginning of my course and no check up to see how i was going and no calls for the clinic i was doing workplacement at to check how i was either it very much felt like i was doing it alone which i suppose is normal for studying online but i didn't have much guidance the course updated towards the end of my studies which was a pain but ended up benefiting me i felt much more supported and the trainers i spoke to were both new and much more comforting supportive and understanding than the previous ones i had spoken to for the last bits and pieces of my course they seem to have lifted the experience and support for future students based on the last few moments of my coursemy only other complaint would be that the questions for the portfolio assignments and interviews were easily misinterpreted and not specific enough for us to get it right the first time overall i wouldn't study online again as i believe i wouldve completed the course faster and had a quicker understanding of the topics had i been in a class environment in saying that having the course materials there for you at your own pace was a huge upside of online studies
4,05-09-2018,in order to be successful in open,in order to be successful in open learning you need to ensure you are self motivated and organised
4,05-09-2018,so far i've enjoyed my experience,so far i've enjoyed my experience  i've learned a lot and had few delays or issues using openspace  i did find a number of links in the course material were old and unusable and it might be time for someone to go through the course and check every link for broken ones and to ensure they're the most relevant some were pretty old  however using a little creativity i usually found a workaround  i did notice a bit of trainer turnover and for some time didn't seem to have a trainer at all but didn't really contact them much anyway  many assessment questions were ambiguous not ideal in a communications course but my guesses as to what they meant turned out fine more often than not i feel the assessment feedback was generally fair i do not know the reputation of my course in the industry but i feel i had to work hard am better prepared than before and learning this way suits me oh and all my assessments were marked within the  days  most more quickly
5,04-09-2018,online learning made easy,online learning made easy excellent content easy to use online format and quick turnaround times for marking would study with open collages again
4,04-09-2018,cerificate iv in programming with open colleges,studying the cerificate iv in programming with open colleges was an enjoyable challenging and rewarding experience i was able to achieve one of my goals by beginning my career as a programmer with a great company it would have been good to see more support for the mac os as it was a windows based course in my experience trainers in the course were helpful and responsive which was a key in staying motivated and getting clarity on some topics i would recommend this course to anyone interested in programming i personally felt the course was very heavy on c and net and not enough exploration with java and its assocaited technology stack
2,04-09-2018,i just want to start my course,i am actually really disappointed with the service i've received so far through open collegesi chose open colleges because they were offering really competitive prices for exactly the same course i was looking at i liked the aspect of self paced study as i work full timei enrolled  that went really wellbut then i applied for recognition of prior learning i sent that off two months ago i heard nothing two weeks later i called after i called they then pushed it forward and assigned it to an assessor that was over a month ago now still nothing i've called and apparently the assessors are unavailable and through emails they just state they are busypretty upset for a hefty price of  to apply for rpl i dont even know if its worth it still don't know if i will even be credited for any units all i want to do is start my course
2,04-09-2018,wouldn't recommend,honestly one of my biggest mistakes would be studying with open collegesi believe the most disappointing things is marking time in total it took over  months for my assignment to be marked and that is beyond ridiculous what was meant to be a  year course was almost some teachers were unhelpful i'd send an email asking for help on certain questions and i'd only recive advise on one little thing i said as well as this one teacher put me in the wrong direction when helping me with a questioni now highly regret even doing this course because so many clinics don't hire people who studied through open colleges it just seems like a great waste of timei would not recommended open colleges to anyone
4,04-09-2018,good experience,good experience helpful knowledgable assistance when required
5,04-09-2018,my experience at open colleges certificate iii in education support,i thoroughly enjoyed the certificate iii in education support i felt that the course covered a wide range of subjects that were very relevant to the work of a ta  this was evident during my placement when i felt well equipped to work with my supervising teacher on various lessons and in a variety of situationsi thought that the assessments throughout the course were well structured and helped me to further integrate the course materiali particularly appreciated the course trainers and tech support personnel the response to any of my queries or issues was pretty prompt and helpfuli would definitely recommend this course and open colleges to any future students
3,04-09-2018,informative,i learnt a lot course material was informative support were great and were happy to help out with extensions as required assessments at times i felt were confusing in what they were asking assesments at times took up to  weeks to mark and not their advertised  days this was a little frustrating it also took a long time to source work placement overall i think the pro's outweighed the con's would i do an open colleges online course againmaybe i think i learn better in a classroom environment
3,03-09-2018,think it over,i was really disappointed no frustrated with the work placement i work in the industry and mistakenly thought it would be a breezevery time consuming to expect workplace supervisors to do so much and that was knowing them so i feel for people trying to pass that don't work in the industry already
5,03-09-2018,online support was great,online support was great helped me get through the course issues i didn't understand my mails were always responded tohave no hesitation in recommending open colleges
2,02-09-2018,do not recommend,do not recommend content was basic online platform full of glitches unprofessional use of facebook by assessors and they did not use proper means of communication took  months to grade work then to be told to move across to a different assignment if i wanted it marken would not recommend oc to anyone infact would recommend anyone else but oc only giving  stars because of the help i got from one assessor in particular who finally got my work marked and was absolutely lovely despite my grumpiness
5,02-09-2018,fabulous,the whole support training and teaching staff are wonderful some of the content needs to be proof read there are minor grammatical mistakes other than that ive loved my experience everyone wanted me to succeed
2,01-09-2018,open colleges provides a great range of,open colleges provides a great range of courses however its very difficult to use their open space system there are long wait times for grading from staff and its difficult to get feedback or support during your course would recommend completing a course at an institution or other provider
5,01-09-2018,sincerely thankful to all my assessors,sincerely thankful to all my assessors to guide me throughout this course it was an amazing way of studying online which was a new experience for me
2,31-08-2018,not great,the learning materials were not engaging some were outdated in regards to the legislation used i feel i didn't learn so much as just trudged through just for the piece of paper at the end
4,30-08-2018,open college was perfect for me,open college was perfect for me it gave me the flexibility i needed having a business to run a parttime job and a young family to attend to i was able to extend the course as i needed and openspace was user friendly response from trainers and staff were prompt and they were usually able to help with my queriesif you are not selfmotivated or struggle to study alone then i wouldn't recommend this way of doing a certificate as  of it has to be done out of your own motivation as there is no ongoing reminders by actual people to keep going or checking to see if you are progressing ok there is no real accountability to anyone but to yourselfi would however definitely use open college for another certificate if i ever wanted to further my training
4,30-08-2018,i had a pretty good experience during,i had a pretty good experience during my course open collages was very accommodating the trainers were excellent and the course material was all helpful relevant and mostly not too hard
3,30-08-2018,the process was not straight forward,the process was not straight forward i wanted to rpl some subject and this took  months for someone to review so i couldn't even start my course until i knew what modules i needed to completehelp is limited and there is a constant changeover of trainers which is frustratinggot there in the end tho
1,29-08-2018,i'm appalled with the student support,i'm appalled with the student supporti had emailed my trainer multiple times throughout my course all to never get a response when i needed help and support centre doesn't properly read the emails and send generic responsesthe limited phone appointments are backed up to a month and they don't even inform you to book in advance which is beyond a jokeso now i get to sit around and do nothing for an entire month just to do an irrelevant phone interview before i can continue with my study
4,29-08-2018,review of additional resources,i thought the course was great very informative and educational the trainers and assessors were very helpful and gave great feedback the only thing i would suggest improving is the additional resources i had lots of trouble accessing these throughout my whole course i contacted the student help for troubleshooting advice which unfortunately didn't help it was only on the last module of my course that the link to the additional resources actually worked for me i also found that these resources weren't very much help at all in my opinion it seemed like they were just repeating exactly what is written in the assessment and weren't giving any extra tips and advice on how to complete the tasks overall i am happy with my experience with open colleges and happy with the outcome of my course
3,29-08-2018,i had mixed experiences with my course,i had mixed experiences with my course i really enjoyed the online portal that was easily accessible both via computer and phone the student support team was fantastic and it was easy to schedule and access phone support and accountability checkins the student support team were extremely approachable and helpful and extensions were granted easily on many occasions study materials were quite outdated in some instances causing unnecessary grief where legislative matters and rates were concerned additionally in most cases significant research beyond the reading material was required in order to complete assessments as the reading material was limited to overarching concepts only my experience with the trainers and assessors was mixed some really went above and beyond my expectations and others were difficult to engage with or get clear advice from but again the support team and coordinators were great and responsive to feedback and willing to direct queries to other trainers where necessary i really appreciated the flexibility of online study and selfpacing but conclude that it is not an ideal learning environment for me i would recommend it to others who are used to selfpacing and disciplined enough to selfmanage timelines i would not recommend the course for people with high expectations or perfectionistic mindsets
4,29-08-2018,i did enjoy this course,i did enjoy this course it suited my lifestyle being online i found the course content excellent and to be honest some of my colleagues who are studying a bachelors were very impressed by the content i felt every bit as prepared as they were doing a degree the assessor were very supportive the only down side were the video role plays there were so many and finding someone who would agree to playing the part of the client was very stressful this actually delayed my progress throughout the course i found that my assessments were marked very quickly and constructive feedback provided overall i have enjoyed my experience and would recommend to future students
5,28-08-2018,easy to deal with,easy to deal with happy with the detail provided and the support offered
4,28-08-2018,webinars and open days,webinars and open daysi was told before i enrolled that it would be more webinars and open days this was very important to me it's quite hard to study online especially when studying designi had to  pay quite a lot for a teacher to teach me how make a pattern and more and it wasn't a requirement to know how to make it in order to join the coursethe trainers were very good but in this particular study i believe their is a need for visual classes thank you
2,28-08-2018,submitted an assignment  months ago,submitted an assignment  months ago and still waiting for it to be marked course guide indicates it will take around  days just keep on getting the same old story we have a backlog strange on backlog in collecting feeshard to finish a course when you can't get your assignments marked
4,27-08-2018,open college review,i am overly happy with learning in open college as my first online coursethe enrolment consultant was comprehensivesite interface and course material were perfect but i strongly recommend you to have sort of real documents as references which student able to read and be aware of the real sort of document such as contract estimating sheet policies etcforeign students required the sort of real material to be familiar with the australia procedure and regulationsreview feedback and tutor conduction were perfect and sometimes strictlyloli am totally satisfied by student supporting department jobas a result i will recommend the open college to my friendsthank you open college staff

3,27-08-2018,pros and cons,over all open space where all the work was given and received was fairly straight forward to use and navigate the course material was pretty simple to understand but the communication was not great they did communicate back if it was something very simple but if not it was very difficult to get to the bottom of your issue it gave the impression that it was almost too hard for them to deal with so they would ignore you
5,27-08-2018,i am so pleased to have reached the,i am so pleased to have reached the finish line in my studies it has been a roller coaster ride and i have learnt a great deal about myself and the industry i'm very pleased i took this journey no regrets
4,27-08-2018,very positive experience at open,very positive experience at open colleges i received my assessments back within one week and very responsive teachers at most times  the only improvement would be perhaps the assessments could use more detailed wording as this would have saved me asking assessors questions and waiting for their response

3,23-08-2018,certificate  in travel,i studied the certificate  in travel with the plan to become a travel agent thereafter during the course i realised that all of my required units will not be regarded as completed until i have done the essential  hours of practical experience in a travel agency this meant i did not have the flexibility to take these units to another course provider as rpl to study a complementary course cert  in travel guide at my local tafe i found this a strange policy and wonder at the reasoning behind it is it to lock you in as a student to complete the courseas others have mentioned here there is a lot of repetition in the course content lectures and not once did i pass an assessment on its first submission there was always a mistake often minor that i had to correct often my mistakes were due to assessment tasks being unclear or ambiguous in what exactly they wanted in the required answer i answered the question incorrectly because a lack of information was providedi have done  post grad university certificates and  post grad diploma and so i naively thought i would blitz this course within  months was i wrong i've now decided to discontinue the course as i am just not enjoying it for the above reasons if you can attend a local education provider i would go for that option they will help you build local contacts which can then lead to work once you finish your certificate and this is something i only discovered after i enrolled with ocas a positive our course coordinator was great and was very helpful when ever it was requiredthank you for your reply unfortunately there is nothing that can be offered as i have been doing the course for more than  months and i am therefore not entitled to move over to another course despite paying the entire course fee up front at the start of the course
4,20-08-2018,i have always been able to receive help,i have always been able to receive help when required with no delays
2,20-08-2018,stressful,stressful poorly written and lacked information on how to self correct if accounts dont balance print versions missed pages of information which was frustrating
3,20-08-2018,easy online no support,i registered with them because they were the only one who was  online and you could do the course in your own time rather than waiting to have units released in this they were great and well worth it unfortunately they were hopeless when it came to the work prac as consistently no one showed up for my reviews or called for my booked checkups i ended out chasing them for months to get it done if you needed help with assignments this was also a let down as they just directed you to the online module helpers which didn't help at all very hard to know how assignments should be formatted as they were inconsistent with marking thankfully there was an independent facebook support group which we all relied on rather than the assessors so all up the course was easy it was the support that was lacking
3,20-08-2018,average,happy with the online platform  was disappointed in many of the assessments in the way they were structured and explained  also with a couple of the results from my assessments i picked up a mistake that the markerassessor had made  they acknowledged thisthe course material could've been more indepth in many areaswebinars were good to start with but over time there weren't many at all and the ones that were performed were very hard to listen to as some had very strong foreign accents which i simply could not understand and quit listening towould use again but not entirely satisfied
5,19-08-2018,opportunities are great,opportunities are greatwould recommend this tafe to anyone and everyone
5,19-08-2018,good experience,good process for completed my qualification online  good feedback from assessors too
4,17-08-2018,the course itself was very thorough,the course itself was very thorough and i feel that i've learnt much more than i would have going through another course providerthe learning materials do need to be updated so they stay relevant to each module it can sometimes take a week or more to get feedback on assessments and get replies from the trainers there were a lot of changes to the course so i had to go back and complete extra assessments student support is great with helping to get extensions if they're needed it is very flexible so it's a great option for stay at home parents or people who have other commitments such as work you can study at your own pace all in all i am happy with what i got out of this experience and i feel i have learnt so much throughout this course
5,17-08-2018,i really enjoyed my time doing,i really enjoyed my time doing certificate iii in education support however i did find that it was more for helping k students rather than high school where i work
1,17-08-2018,poor,would not recommendunorganised far too long to get marks back and move on to the next topiccoursecalledemailed multiple times with no resolutionvery frustrating

2,16-08-2018,lack of reply,several issues with assessors and advisors not replying to emails and multiple followups before issues were resolved little to no support was given
4,16-08-2018,overall a positive experience,overall a positive experience  i didnt require much assistance from open colleges trainers but the two times i did  i was disappointed because information i required did not get through to me or was misinterpretedi understand this was because of a change of assessor both times as a result of this  i would have appreciated some consistency in assessors
5,16-08-2018,open colleges,open colleges provides a holistic learning environment that allows you to grow and evolve there are a range of support people available to guide and help you through all academic issues the assignments are clear and understandable with easy upload assistance i would recommend this form of education to everyone
5,15-08-2018,i have had great experience doing my,i have had great experience doing my course with open college support staff are dedicated trainers and assessors are technically qualified and personally trustworthy thank you
2,15-08-2018,assessing staff shortages months waiting to be graded,takes ages to grade the assignmentscourse start fairly good with quick response  days after submitting the assignmentduring last year slowing down and taking up to  months for grading one of the assignments was overlooked for  and a half monthsafter a call the staff promise to call u with explanation when the grading will be completed no call madeafter five calls over  months period formal complain lodged poor excusesemploy more staff if you cant handle backlogwould finish  months earlier if not delays with gradingwouldnt recommend unless above issues are resolved
4,15-08-2018,great learning platform for wider career options,open colleges have provided a learning platform for me to pursue career options on line study is not easy and you have to be committed to the task and follow the instructions and link into resources in order to get information for successful completionthe assessor's and feedback provided by them was timely and reasonable i had no issues with timeframes and only had issue on one occasion when a new assessor was assigned to the subject which after following up was rectifiedoften answers to my questions could be found within other students conversations in relation to the subjectthe website and log in never caused me any problems either
5,14-08-2018,it's a little early to ask me 'how was my course' don't you think,i think giving a rating at present is a little early as i am only  weeks into my  year course  maybe this email should be sent at intervals throughout the course say mid way and at the end  however in saying this the experience i have received thus far from enrolling in the course to communicating with trainers has been awesome  so yes i would recommend you to a friend
5,14-08-2018,dont just study hard also study smart,open college allowed me to not just work hard and complete all my assessments but it also allowed me to improve as an individual and develop my understanding about the specific course that i took which is cert ii in information digital media and technologyi would certainly recommend open college to anyone who finds it hard to cope with time flexibility as it is a very effective way of studying
5,14-08-2018,i had a lot of difficulties during my,i had a lot of difficulties during my course and the staff at open colleges were marvellous and supportive in helping me get through the first stage thank you so much
5,14-08-2018,open colleges was a great place to,open colleges was a great place to learn the support that i received there from fiona and the other teachers was second to none i would recommend open colleges to anyone
3,13-08-2018,assessment checking should check,assessment checking should check probably
5,13-08-2018,the experience to share,the course was quite different from what was expected but in a good waythe student support team was helpful but would be more efficient to call them than send an emaili liked how everything is clean the lab and the bathroomsthe only let down is the car park but this won't be the issue for the evening classoverall a very good experience with the online and the facetoface delivery of the coursewell done guys
3,13-08-2018,needs more content detail of course,before beginning the course it needs to be outlined that there is no interaction only reading i expected online lectures and more communication and interaction with my 'lecturers' i feel i could have just read a book and come out the end with the same amount of knowledge but  better off
5,13-08-2018,journey to accomplish cert iv in disability,excellent support and prompt to feedback for my assignments from assessors at open collegesi did start as late as  months from the start date still i received tremendous support from the student support team who granted me course deferment and later approved for two months paid course extension to take my time to complete all the assignmentsi would like to thank the faculties miss sanet sir rob and miss alison who helped me to assess my assignments promptly to expedite to finish my course particularly miss sanet who helped me with my work placementcheers
5,13-08-2018,easy to read and comprehend lectures,easy to read and comprehend lectures and modules method of imparting information makes the subject not so esoteric college may need to read through the modules as there are some spelling and grammatical errors on many sections also the college may need to revisit ueeneeea solve problems in dc circuits project  steps  and  there are some inconsistences that confuse the students the question refers to figure  which is in step  but erroneously states return the circuit to view how it was in step  this should have stated return the circuit to view how it was in step
4,12-08-2018,course material was excellent and,course material was excellent and engagingi did not think there was enough information on the order of work and when to get work placement and the support team were not very responsive until i chased themthe only other issue was that none of my videos could be uploaded due to size restrictions  even after compression it meant posting files on usb which added delaysin hindsight i would do a practical course like this facetoface rather than online but i would recommend open colleges for other courses
2,11-08-2018,good course marking wait time terrible poor communication,the course overall was fine would have loved to have more interactive learning material ie webinars etc but marking of assessments was quick they only sent out my course book once i called them instead of at the end of my second study period marking of portfolio however  took  weeks after two complaints i was told when i submitted would be  weeks which was ridiculous enough i was not notified there would be an extension of that by  weeks six months waiting to have my final submission marked held me back in my career as well as financially  not to mention i had already paid for the course prior to waiting the  months now i have passed i still have to wait  weeks just to get my certificate if i had known it would take this long i would have done my course somewhere else
3,11-08-2018,good course not good support,the course itself was great i learnt a lot through the content some of the assessors are fantastic marking assignments quickly and giving constructive feedback other assessors were terrible no support and making students wait way too long to do what they needed to so i could continue with the course its very frustrating when all you want to do is study and you cant because the assessor is holding you up its very hard to get help when the assessor you need ignored your messages there is also very little opportunity for work placement in south australia which no one tells you before you start
5,11-08-2018,overall good,good course material  i found the staff to be very friendly and helpful  thanks
2,10-08-2018,be warned,my experience was one of delayed responses incorrect information given no communication between departments no follow up on my portfolio unnecessary delay to complete my course more than m months very few people were able to assist me and this assistance came at the very end of my course i had lodged a formal complaint which was rejected by open colleges very poor student service would not recommend to anyone open colleges would not be my choice for further studies
3,10-08-2018,need flexible learning then choose open coolege,excellant study resources great assessments to work with and prompt reply and valuable feedback from the assessors flexible learning helped me lot with my other commitments anyway i felt so hard working alone by myself and moving forward getting immediate response and help is bit difficult
4,10-08-2018,social worker,the course was fine i am disappointed that i didn't do the social worker course within a class as i would of liked a lot more real time discussions about issues online is a bit more anti social for such a social course
5,09-08-2018,the learning is designed very well and,the learning is designed very well and all of the assessors wants you to do well they answer all questions that are relevant and are very forth coming with any struggles you may have well studyingi like open colleges as all assessments are done within your own time
5,09-08-2018,fantastic provider gave me all the,fantastic provider gave me all the support i needed and made studying while also working full time totaly achievable
4,09-08-2018,it's been a great experience studying,it's been a great experience studying online in open colleges the staff are really knowlegeable and you can learn a lot from them
5,09-08-2018,good learning,i have learnt so much with this course it has put me out of my comfort zone and has pushed me to improved my photography i can now take images that i was not able to before my studies the content is good and the assignments make you have to research a lot in your camera manual youtube photography blogs etc my tutors have been great support and their advice and expertise has helped me to understand better the photography field
2,07-08-2018,not the best,sent me the wrong assignments work placement was a nightmare lucky to have completed it in time
4,07-08-2018,course content,i found the course had great corse content in reference to the travel industry and covered necessary topics although i did feel some of the information was slightly out dated
3,07-08-2018,the team of teachers were always their,the team of teachers were always their to offer assistance and very supportive and helpful when needed but i found the overall course content repetitive and unrealistic expectations of the role and responsibilities of a education support worker
5,07-08-2018,what a great experience studying,what a great experience studying online you guys are so easy to contact and the course tutors responded and marked assessments so quicklyhighly recommend
5,07-08-2018,open colleges was great to study with,open colleges was great to study with so much so i am going on and doing my diploma of enrolled nursing with open colleges there facilities  are great and the educator i had fiona saunders is a credit to them she was fantastic and made studying fun
3,07-08-2018,assignments were poorly written and,assignments were poorly written and often contained errors
2,06-08-2018,diploma of graphic design  don't bother,i did a diploma of graphic design there was very little guidance with how to use the tools in each of the adobe programs this was assumed knowledge even in the prediploma course i did which is meant to get you up to speed for the diploma it was lucky i had used the programs before it glossed over a lot of the important aspects of graphic design i really didn't feel prepared to work as a graphic designer after i finished the course so i basically wasted my money
5,06-08-2018,the staff are great help,the staff are great help and when you connect with a study buddy it helps even better learned quite a bit from the course especially with excel spreadsheets would recommend
4,06-08-2018,the tutors were generally considerate,the tutors were generally considerate and helpful
4,06-08-2018,room for improvement,the material was very informative and i learnt a lot however i would have liked some more interactive readinglearning material such as power points or mini seminars and videos to break it up a bit my assessors were very helpful once the got back to me they could improve on getting back to me faster quite often i had to contact student support because i hadn't heard from my assessors in weeks regarding a question about assessmentsall in all i learnt lots and feel accomplished and supported i just think assessors could be more time efficient and there needs to me moredifferent learning material to keep it interestingalso i would like to see things done on the home screen where everyone can post i'd wish it was more interactive so we could really build a community to help each other study buddies was a great idea but as an over all community i think if there was more traffic and intriguing content on the home page that would have been nicer to lean on fellow study buddies and create an even more enjoyable experience so we don't feel like we are in this alone
5,05-08-2018,open college cover everything in the,open college cover everything in the course
2,05-08-2018,not happy with service and,not happy with service and understanding particularly as i asked for an extension after unforeseen  house relocation from nsw to wa and also poor health later discovered to be hormonal and severely iron deficient which hampered my ability to do anything
3,02-08-2018,open colleges as a whole were good,open colleges as a whole were good however the assessors could use some improvement
5,02-08-2018,my experience with studying through,my experience with studying through open colleges was a really positive one there is plenty of information at your finger tips to get you started especially if you havent studied for some time like me my trainers and assessors were responsive to my queries in a timely manner and i would highly recommend anyone looking for a study option to use them i was able to pay for my studies using a weekly payment plan which was also a reason i chose to go with open colleges
5,02-08-2018,happy student,whatever i needed i got the help there is support in all areas
4,02-08-2018,open colleges cert iii education support,i enjoyed being able to study at my own pace and be able to work as well
1,02-08-2018,they dont support you at all,they dont support you at all ive never heard from a teacher or anyone the only people ive spoken to are people wanting money from me their booklets dont make sense there is no support at all they dont care about their students just want money dont waste your time
5,02-08-2018,flexibility and convenience,flexibility and convenience that make opencolleges stand out of the crowd
5,02-08-2018,i will keep recommending and have,i will keep recommending and have recommended this college to friends and family i received wonderful service with open colleges they were very supportive of me when i was going through tough times whilst studying and even gave me time off when i desperately needed to go overseas to say a final goodbye to my grandfather whom was terminally illi am very thankful for the friendly guidance and overwhelming amount of support i received from the wonderful staff at open colleges and wish them good luck with the grading of assessments to come in the final few months of the year
5,02-08-2018,open colleges  a,i found open colleges to be an excellent university if i want to study anything else i'll be looking at open colleges first up
4,01-08-2018,so happy,great course content nice tutors over all i would recommend open colleges as it suited me well the marking time on the final portfolios is the only point in which i was disappointed i feel that if they dont have the staff to have a decent turn around time either run on more staff or limit the number of enrolments
2,31-07-2018,means to an end,i went with open colleges as a means to an end because i was unable to quit my job to study full time or to pay for a premium course offered by tafe nswcontent is full of grammatical errors as are the quizsassessments take a long time to come back markedif you really want to learn the content id suggest going a different institution or supplementing your study with additional textsbut if you plan on doing most of your learning in an apprenticeship and just want a cert ii to get your foot in the door then this is the way to go i completed my course casually in under  days
4,31-07-2018,easy to understand workbooks,easy to understand workbooks easy to follow assessmentsuploading videos was too hard and took up way too much timesome questions went unanswered while other trainers answered questions straight away
5,31-07-2018,stars,stars excellent  no reservations i would recommend this company to anyone
4,30-07-2018,i found the course material and support,i found the course material and support services including my trainer fantastic the only area that i think could be improved would be open space it is very hard to use on a smart phone as is not always acurate i think an app would be easier for students to check results submit assessments and interact with students and trainers
1,31-07-2018,don't study with open colleges,open colleges animal studies make finding placement sound easy when you're signing up but no vet clinic animal park hospital etc will take open college students for placement open colleges are so disorganised and hard to work with that these places are turning away students and open college won't help you get any placement hours once you've paid your feesi even had hours taken away after i'd completed them because i hadn't told open college i was  weeks pregnant that's illegal in australiain response to the reply from open colleges i have already attempted to discuss these issues with open colleges numerous times but have just had terrible probably against consumer law policy copy and pasted to me in replies that took weeks to receive  were always from someone different or no reply at all
3,30-07-2018,the curriculum changing a short time,not an entirely positive experiencethe curriculum changing a short time into starting my course  with little or no recognition of previous subjects studied was discouragingout dated subject matter and copious errors in the course material  very frustratingassessors were helpful encouraging and supportive
3,30-07-2018,helpful student support,helpful student support  but marking took forever and took over a week to hear back from trainers
3,30-07-2018,overall open colleges was not too bad,overall open colleges was not too bad for online studyi found that with marking the assessments it took too long in getting back to you some of the webinars were a bit long winded and when you sent an email to one of the trainers they took a long time to respond
3,28-07-2018,full on but learnt so much,overall i feel like i learnt heaps the assignments on the whole were interesting and taught me lots  the college were very accommodating in giving me extra time when i ran over my original finish date and over the  years that it took me to complete the course i have even managed to make some friends despite this being an online course i also found that feedback on my assessments was fairly prompt within a few days and was pretty comprehensive and on the odd occasion that i wanted more i just emailed and got it  there were some downsides with the course though there is no facetoface contact whatsoever i would have liked to have had the odd online skype session to log into i also felt that the trainers were distinctly lacking from open college's own forum there are numerous examples of messages sent by students to the general forum that remain unanswered i much preferred the way the fundamentals was set up in which the trainer played a very active role it felt less like the blind leading the blind and more like you had received personalised tuition there is also a lot of dead links in the course material which i thought was unacceptable given the amount of money i paid to do the course as well as a lot of repetitive notes but in some ways this might be a good thing eg repeatedly returning to copyright and moral rights meant that it was really reinforced despite these things i would recommend the course it was full on  so many weekends and evenings spent studying but i feel like i have grown a lot as a graphic designer in the last  years and learnt more than i could ever have done without open colleges guidance
3,28-07-2018,open colleges is my first online study through a provider,open colleges is my first online study for a more than months course i think some assessors are amazing but others lack a little bit  i find that from studying online from wa it seems an office this side of australia would benefit thousands the delay in replies is over a week this is too long when you need help or a questions answered i find that working full time and studying is doable however its hard to contact anyone when its on aest  we need more support for this side so that when we finish work it is not all closed  i think open colleges could be a really great provider if they communicated better and didn't leave students waiting without a reply  my time in cert ii was good but i felt a lack of support with an issue with my supervisor i feel like people should be supported by their provider  within reason and i would of felt alot more supported had someone helped me in my situation with my supervisor i basically was free labour and learnt nothing very sad after paying thousands for this course i think less time spend on paper works and more time being spent on where students should or should not be sent or allowed to go to would help greatly over all i loved my assessor cassandra she was above and beyond course was good the online part was good once you knew your way around and easy enough to learn and follow i urge open colleges to be based in wa aswell and im sure alot would be quicker and smoother overall i am satisfied and like i mentioned above open colleges could be great just needs a little more communication thank you
4,26-07-2018,mostly solo learning,it's a great company if you want to just do your course without much interaction there are trainers you can ask questions of and a community where you can reach out to other people doing the same course if you like
2,26-07-2018,unless you are extremely self motivated or have a lot of assistance study on campus,unless you are extremely self motivated or have a lot of assistance study on campusthere is a lot of encouragement to sign up but once you've done that you are largely alone some of the trainers are really good but the support is terribly lacking course material may not reflect what is actually being asked of you ie it's not fleshed out poorly written hard to follow there are silly headings with little content in the course materiallinks that don't work because assessments are years old and not updated i had an issue with some trials on software that ran out my trainer hadn't used them so couldn't help on campus id have been sent to it and one of their guys would have explained how to use ambient occlusionindigo similarly autodesk expired my license before i could finish and luckily they are really good and it got reinstated and my work was all saved but a savvy lecturer could have helped me the college suggested an extension for these issues but more time wasnt the problem it was the right help figuring out what to do luckily it worked out and i believe i qualified for my diploma today
3,26-07-2018,overall experience,study materials  goodstudent support  very goodreference library neededwebsite and online connectivity  goodreply to learners questions  often delayed including emailsassessment items very goodflexibility excellentoverall learning experience was very good

4,26-07-2018,i just completed my diploma of,i just completed my diploma of counselling with open colleges i work full time and have two teenage kids so this online course was a good option for mei found student support very helpful and thought all the assessors were great i would definitely recommend open colleges
5,25-07-2018,it is great to be able to do things at,it is great to be able to do things at your own pace but it can sometimes mean you get a bit lazy always set yourself goals and try to stick to them to keep on topthe staff have been amazing and i wouldn't have been able to do it without their support and help i had a preemie baby while studying and even then i had the help from staff so i wasn't stressing about study while in hospital with bubsso happy i studied with oc
4,24-07-2018,a great online learning option,i have found open colleges to be a great online learning option  i like the fact that you can pay off the courses in installments the trainers and assessors are fantastic and the overall experience has been great  the open space portal is easy to use and access  time between finishing and starting a new course is a tad too long but other than that i have really enjoyed learning with open colleges
1,24-07-2018,i would never study with open colleges,i would never study with open colleges again this is the secon time ive studied with open colleges this first time i was disappointed but after a  years had past it appeared that open colleges had improved on there support and assignment material ive just finished my course in interior decorating  but this course was more about creating plans and elevations than about  soft furnishings and  finishes  i feel ive studied a interior design course instead of interior decorating course so there wasnt really anything useful within the course to become a decorator  it was more about drawing d perspective and creating plans and elevations which isnt used in interior decorating
5,23-07-2018,loved studying with open colleges,loved studying with open colleges the trainers and assessors were always helpful and the course material was laid out well and easy to follow i hope to study again with ooen colleges in the future
5,23-07-2018,easy to use and highly recommended,it was easy to call and check any quires that came up the course information learning at own pace was beneficial and easy to use feedback was thorough and helpful
5,23-07-2018,my experience,my experiencewould recommend anyone to open colleges the study is very good and had a good experience throughout my journey the assessors are very helpful friendly and communications were very fast and reliable it is worth my study  great work and keep it up open colleges
2,23-07-2018,not the experience i was wanting when studying,i found studying diploma in early childhood education with open colleges to be outdatedi feel the amount of work required for students is beyond what is needed  and what is realistic to complete in the work placement time framei found the workplace assessments a b  c far more then a 'recap' of units completed  the work required in these was more then excessivethe unit helpers did not match up to the units on numerous occasionsthe marking is very inconsistent with the changing of asked for each unitworkplace assessmentthe expectations of a student on placement is excessive students are not able to access all personal information of families and childrenasking students to find errors in policies and procedures and raise them with director  and express ways to 'improve' them is not something a student should be expected to doto recieve feedback saying at diploma level you should be giving more information is not helpful or needed  at the time of studying a student is not at a diploma leveli found lengthy delays in receiving replys to messages sent to assessor'si did however find the student information line very helpful friendly and fast acting
2,23-07-2018,would not recomend,studying vet nursing through oc was far more difficult than it needed to be there was virtually no contact from any teachers or support staff no one checking in on progress feed back from assessments was lacking and the wait time for marking was a complete joke it felt as if they were setting you up to fail or run out of time information given at sign up was incorrect and misleadingword of mouth is oc is no good its students will definitely find it harder to get work with oc on their resumescompletion of the course relies heavily on work placement providing training and education as offered course material is severely lacking in quality students must be able to self educated in order to passmarking criteria of assessments is a mystery which is very frustrating and unprofessional the waiting time for the major portfolio assessment was  months no joke  weeks of nothingness then a further  weeks for the resubmission marking which due to the lack of marking criteria and guidelines everyone must submit their portfolio more than onceone good thing about the open is that the staff are lovely once you actually do get to speak to one of themi am just so glad its over and i was able to complete the course even though the stress it caused made it almost not worth it
1,22-07-2018,very disappointing and lack of,very disappointing and lack of commination i have still no yet received a response to two messages sent to my course coordinator i enjoyed the material but thought it was very dry at times and thought it could be more interactive with videos and hand on material as opposed to just reading material in a text book
1,22-07-2018,scam nightmare,do not sign up with this company they are a scam i wasted nearly  on this and urge everyone to stay well away they rip hard working people from their money i asked for a refund and was refused they make students pay thousands for a few online quizzes and offer no help at all with courses or work placement do not sign up for this company i have friends in high places with a local magazine and a few companies around my city who deal with thousands of young students and have told them the truth about this company i am working with them to get the message out about this companies scam and will not stop until everyone knows the truth
5,20-07-2018,well thought out and relevant,well thought out and relevant coursework excellent student support highly engaging
4,20-07-2018,great flexibility,i'm glad i made the decision to study through opencolleges as the flexibility of studying online is great for those with a busy lifestyle that cant attend a campus being able to pay for the course over a payment plan was also handy
4,20-07-2018,all in all a very good experience,all in all a very good experience  studying is a very difficult thing to do online as while doing assignments you sometimes need instant support  sometimes i find answers that i have requested can take time in coming in  when they do come in they are very informative  i would recommend open colleges and i have before
2,20-07-2018,oc vn,very slow turnaround minimal communication confusing support systems frustrating
5,20-07-2018,course review,had a great experience with open colleges through out my course i had all the support from the support team  watching webinar definitely recommend anyone if they want to change career or gaining more qualification you can complete any course in your own time
1,19-07-2018,not support at all,unfortunately i felt alone in the whole course without direction or help there was never a tutor who would take the time to explain issues the course is as oneself understand i only had support in the practical part
4,18-07-2018,supportive assessors,supportive assessors the best decision i made
5,18-07-2018,very helpful and easy ways to complete,very helpful and easy ways to complete my studies

5,18-07-2018,excellent customer service and content,excellent customer service and great content throughout the course the assessor was always helpful and quick on his replies as well as at grading
2,18-07-2018,not a great course,i did my ceritifcate iv in veterinary nursing through this college and let me tell you it was awful by the end of the course i had two years to complete it in which i did but i have seen a lot of other people not completing it in this time frame i worked with other trainee nurses in my clinic that went though other tafes and they had a way more smoother course experience than this if you are not motivated enough this course is very hard to complete it is strictly online and the communication is not great between students and assessors the instructions they give you to complete this course are unclear and sometimes incomprehensible that you have to do major assessments multiple times to fully understand a question and then pass it started off good as it was easy but other than that i would not recommend this course to others unless there is no other way they can complete a certificate
5,17-07-2018,very happy with the service and,very happy with the service and feedback from the trainers always there to help
5,17-07-2018,very helpful people over the  years,very helpful people over the  years the support and the response to my concerns was really quik and effectivethe information in ecery module and topic was extensive and understandablethanks
5,17-07-2018,recommended online course,i have received  stars support and guidance throughout the whole process from the initial support of choosing the right course to give feedback for my assessment the open colleges team have been great they have answered my queries promptly and assessment feedback is clear
5,17-07-2018,open colleges  a great way to study online,open colleges was a fantastic way to study online  the course was selfpaced and the college provided great online tools and information about planning your study time  there was always help at hand either from the academic staff or the support staff  the course was very flexible and the content was relevant and interesting i have no hesitation in recommending open colleges to friends and family
1,17-07-2018,the worst company i have even dealt,the worst company i have even dealt with the lack of communication and support delays in marking and the change in management and course materials has put my whole career on hold will never again study with open colleges for the fees they charge definitely not acceptable
1,16-07-2018,the delay in marking and response to,the delay in marking and response to questions unbelievablely frustrating  being assessed by differant assessors  not being able to have a consistent assessor who you develop a understanding with student support giving differant information from each other the making of the videos was so hard i don't understand why you aren't assessed when you have your workplace assessment done instead of making the videos unfortunately will not being doing any further courses not user friendly for me at all
5,16-07-2018,stars,i have enjoyed studying with open colleges using the online portal means that i can study at a time that suits me and i can study from anywhere if it wasn't for the flexibility of this course i would not have been able to complete my cert iv in beauty therapythe content of the course literature is clear and concise the assessors are also very helpful and have maintained the highest level of professionalism for the duration of me course i feel that the assessors are very knowledgeable in their field of expertisethank you
3,13-07-2018,i would recommend wa students not to do,i would recommend wa students not to do this course i found the contents of the course easy but when it came to trying to receive help or assistance throughout it was very difficulti understand that open college has a lot of online students to attend to my suggestion don't offer the course outside of nswstudents find a course that you are looking for closer to where you live and attend the course not online
5,13-07-2018,some of the modules were challenging,some of the modules were challenging but i love challenges especially with the typing test and the lack of spell checks in some of the modules as some had many spelling mistakes such as queen's council instead of queen's counsel
4,12-07-2018,i have done a few courses through open,i have done a few courses through open colleges although self paced there is always someone from the staff who are so kind and help the best they can
4,12-07-2018,great course i enjoyed it throughly,great course i enjoyed it throughly some questions in the assessments were not clear enough staff was good student support was a little bit slow at times but overall very well organised
3,11-07-2018,i enjoyed studying with open college,i enjoyed studying with open college however i felt that the support was not great questions took a while to be answered which made studying difficult when working full time if i had a day off to study and didnt understand the content i had to wait sometimes a week for my questions to be answered
5,11-07-2018,loved that i could study at my own pace,loved that i could study at my own pace day or night staff were all so friendly helpful and answered any questions i had really quickly marking time was a little long but i could just move on to the next module while i waited
1,11-07-2018,disappointing in every way,extremely slow in grading assessments must be understaffed workplacement was hard to find due to online studies took  months to find unorganised workplace assessor could not even make a to visit me on placement therefore another hour  of my time doing assessment over the phone which was ridiculous and cant see how this was actually assessing my onsite work every time i finished an assessment i had to spend time calling student support to unlock a module or had a technical issue not my fault constant changes in trainers overall a horrible experience compared to other studies not at all happy with open colleges wast of time and money with all the waiting for grades and support
5,11-07-2018,just amazing,from the time that i enrolled until the end of my studies i had the best service that i could have asked for my assessor maryanne was just amazing she always gave the most relevant advise and feedback on each assessment which made it easier to move forward or sometimes redoing some assessment questions thank you open college for the awesome experience it has made a huge difference in me ands my families life
5,10-07-2018,fantastic support and loved the,fantastic support and loved the selfpaced style of study
3,10-07-2018,definitely learnt a lot and enjoyed my,definitely learnt a lot and enjoyed my studies however course content contains a lot of grammical errors and broken links assessments are poorly worded and difficult to understand there were a few trainersassessors that were extremely helpful and i learn a lot from however there were also trainersassessors that sometimes never responded to a query or were very unhelpful if open colleges could work on these issues and their communication they would be a great provider to go with
5,10-07-2018,overall it was a great experience,overall it was a great experience and i have enrolled in another couse  however the one problem i found was that videos of    mins were required but even compressed they would not upload so this is an area which needs urgent attention
5,10-07-2018,my honest experience would be that,my honest experience would be that where i have asked for help it was given  in hindsight i would say that whatever you do make sure you have a study buddy  it is much harder on your own  as a mature aged student i am 'over the moon' that i was able to complete the cert iv in bookkeeping
5,10-07-2018,certificate iv professional writing and editing,i enjoyed doing my course through open colleges doing my course online allowed me flexibility to work at my own pace which has been important as i work full time the units of work and assessment tasks have been practical and useful for where i want to take my learning the only downside i have found with online learning is not being able to connect with other students in the course i have had to be extremely self motivated to keep my momentum going
4,09-07-2018,it was a great experience with open,it was a great experience with open colleges all trainers and assessors too helpful
4,09-07-2018,definitely improved my photography,i enjoyed the course and it has definitely improved me as a photographer the images i produced for the final assessment were of a quality i could not have reached at the beginning of the course  i've even entered a couple of them in a competitionthe only issue i had was time  i had to extend my finish date a couple of times due to time pressures from work family etc however not being naturally artistic i probably had to put in much more time to work out what i wanted to do than others would
1,09-07-2018,dont provide enough support to wa,dont provide enough support to wa students and the workbooks and assessments are poorly worded and not clear wouldnt recommend
4,08-07-2018,review,open colleges is an excellent form of online education especially for those who are good at self paced learning however there were quite a few times where either the learning material wasn't quite clear or the assessments were a bit hard to understand but all in all i would recommend this form of education
2,07-07-2018,outdated course materials,i was very disappointed in the content of course materials it was twelve years old and much of the information was outdated when i questioned the course tutor she mentioned that new materials were being developed as i had invested a lot of money in taking the course i then questioned whether i would get access to these materials i was told i would but i never heard anything more about it i would not recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to enrol in further study
5,07-07-2018,a life and career changing experience,i thoroughly recommend open colleges for online learning the support you receive from the administration team  the academic support the other students in the course and the trainers and assessors was fantastic the content is industry based and up to date it's relatable and relevant when you go from the theory into the practical component of the course in your work placement i enjoyed every aspect of the course and because of this i have secured work in this industrythanks open colleges for providing me with an avenue to change my vocation in a way that worked for me
2,05-07-2018,room for improvement,i found the content in the workbook was understandable and interesting the assessments were very difficult and confusing to understand including what was needed what level of detail and in what format the forum must not be used to gain feedback on the issues raised by students as the same issues are raised over and over again without any corrective actions there are questions in the quiz's that have more than one correct answer but if you pick the wrong one it makes a substantial impact on your grade as there are only approx  questions this would be evident if you looked at the high percentage of students getting the same answer wrong but it feels like from a student prospective that it is either too hard or you don't carei found the trainers were knowledgeable and helpful most of the time on a few occasions responses to questions were answered privately  which may be appropriate but afterwards the answer should be added to help others if questions are not going to be answered within  days it should raise an alert pay more overtime get more trainers what ever it takesoverall this course has highlighted to me that those in charge of this course would benefit from a refresher course in management
5,05-07-2018,i have just completed my course and i,i have just completed my course and i am going straight into casual work in the area which i have studied  the course has been interesting and informative while preparing me to work in my chosen field  the trainers and assessors are very helpful and supportive as are all the support staff at open colleges  i would be happy to study with open colleges again and have no reservations in recommending the college to others
5,05-07-2018,got a great support when i was,got a great support when i was struggling to complete the course on time
5,04-07-2018,i loved studying with open colleges,i loved studying with open colleges great support loved the course material and the assessors are fantastici have definately recommended you guysthanks again for everythingtamara
2,04-07-2018,not enough assessors for marking,not enough assessors for marking assignments and waiting time for feedback is poor
5,04-07-2018,i really enjoyed this course journey,i really enjoyed this course journey  the resources and materials were presented extremely well for the understanding of online  it's sometimes difficult to interpret online instruction and learning and this course offered all the solutionsthe support from the team was incredible and very professional
5,03-07-2018,a really good course to have under your belt if your dream job is a fashion designer,the best thing i've ever done for myself for a long time i've enrolled the diploma in fashion design and merchandising   years ago it was not the certificate that i after but the skills that i need under my belt to be ready to get out there doing what i lovethis course is perfect for someone who is discipline and passionate about fashion design as it teaches you everything you need to know from fashion drawings to pattern making pattern grading and draping but not so much sewing previous experience of sewing would give you a good startit is also a perfect course for someone who is thinking of changing career as this is fully online it allowed me to work fulltime and study after hours you need to be really discipline though to be able to keep up with the work as there are quite good solid practical assessments that you need to complete but boy they gave me really good experience and satisfaction about the final products that i produced you are only limit by your imaginationcurrently i work as a software developer and in a process of transitioning it took me a long time to decide to switch because i didn't hate my current job and it is also stable with reasonable pay being in the same field for a while almost  years and i feel like i need to grow i don't like to climb the cooperate lather and technically i feel like i couldn't grow much more higher so anyway i found this course online and it is perfect for me to resurrect my childhood's dream job i have to say i was very focus and determine not to slip with time as doing selfpace training i've seen quite a few students could not make it just because they didn't keep up being persistent and consistent they left things to the very last minutesmy advice for everyone out there who is thinking of online training with practical course like this you should be consistent and keep doing little thing everyday you'll be surprise how far you will go manage your time and divide the course to the time that you have i reckon i did have a few breaks here and there in between ie went holiday took time off to make garments for a competition etc so it's not as if that i was all the time windup   years is plenty of time for a fulltime worker if you do it by itself i think you could knock it off  months to a yearanyway i'm ready for the next chapter of my life
4,02-07-2018,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open collages the course material was easy to follow and assessments easy to submit i came in very apprehensive as i had not studied since high school but the modules were not overwhelming and i loved working at my own pace all queries were answered in a timely manner and assessments graded within the time frames stated the feedback was helpful and constructivei loved the youtube videos to help with assessments im so happy i chose open collages
5,02-07-2018,great support and thoughtful feedback,great support and thoughtful feedback have recommended this course already
3,02-07-2018,the course material is good and very,the course material is good and very flexible making it easy to study at your own pace the downside is when it comes to finding work placement i feel the college is not doing enough in this area it leaves the burden to the student to find their own placement  this is a very difficult and at times frustrating experience dealing with prospective organisations who most of the times are turned off by the huge amount of paperwork requirements they are expected by the college to complete before thry can take you on board in my view the college must just establish a good rapport with organisations in every state and handle the work placements issue so that students concentrate on the actual studying
1,02-07-2018,hard course to get through,book keeping cert iv course material in the modules was subpar at best with no way it prepares you for the assessment that are long tedious vague and confusing you're made to use software you don't know how to use myob therefore many hours are spent trying to figure out how to input data or make corrections there is no instruction from oc how to do the transactions they've asked you to do in the assessment so you're left on your own to figure it out you're advised to use google a lot many times what is asked in the assessment was not covered in the modules that prep you for their assessments so often you're left to google other websites most students submit assessments they know are wrong just to get clarification from teachers open colleges was sold to me as being flexible so i could study on my own time as i work full time this means evenings and weekends however there are no teachers available evenings or weekends so i was often left on my own where even student support couldn't help me as they are administration only you have the option of a call back by a teacher in  business days during business hours which just never worked and meant more time wasted for a cert  this was way too hard to get through and i would never recommend oc to anyone else in fact i have actively diverted my family and friends from signing up with oc because of my own experience i'm also not confident that i have the skills nor am i properly prepared to work in the industry i studied so many times i wanted to just give up the course and only hung in there because i paid alot of money for it i feel there is potential to make this a great course and i am speaking up in hope oc will take a good look at this course and make some much needed changes to it for their future students as i know i am not the only one who feels this way
2,02-07-2018,my experience with open colleges wasextremely disappointing,my experience with open colleges was awful  i would never recommend them to anyone  to be honest there are too many instances to mention so the short version ispoor customer servicepoor incomplete resourcesno replies to emails to student support  for people working full time and working long hours phoning isn't always an optionsigning up for a dual cert iv and being told you have  years to complete it  then find out i had been removed from the business admin cert iv because time had run out it hadn't been  years and i had no contact to say this was happening as someone at some point changed my email address to add a 'au' on the end  funny thing was i was still having my assessment graded even though i had been removed  i had sent an email to student support for some technical help and received no reply in over a month had sent other emails and contacted the assessorthen told by the person on the phone that they could see my email but no one had responded because i was removed from the course  seriouslyi received some feedback re  assessment which stated that if i wanted to be a leader i had to lead by example and that adding dot points in my table was confusing   this comment directly under the table that was part of the assessment and full of dot points  also told that i would have scored higher if i didn't add dot points in my table there were  dot pointshow is it that you offer a dual cert iv and yet student support don't realise that it is one course not two seperate courses  as soon as i'd passed i get an email saying congrats on finishing your cert iv in leadership and managementfollowed by another email saying congrats on enrolling in your cert iv business admin  it took phone calls to sort that mess out tooas i saidthere were many instances like this but it all just boils down to poor processes and people not being properly trained on what their job is from start to finish i felt like it was a waste of time and not worth the paper it's written on  i'm lucky because i have years of experience but i feel sorry for the people doing this course who are young or haven't had experience working in administration
5,02-07-2018,excellent uptodate content and modern format,excellent uptodate content in an easy to read format lots of activities to take part in and share with online community all work required for assessments is covered in the course trainers are very responsive i couldn't be happier with open colleges
5,02-07-2018,i had a really good experience with,i had a really good experience with open colleges especially great tutor fiona saunders fiona really prepared us well to face placement and what's ahead in the future she's a legendi was a bit frustrated with the it side of things had to ask every time to open next modules and communication with to get other it issues sorted took a long time to respond and sort out issues myself by the time they got back to mestudy material was really good quality and customer friendlywill definitely recommend open colleges and will study in future again through open colleges
3,01-07-2018,hit and miss better communication needed,ive wnrolled in two courses at open colleges diploma in early childhood education and care and certificate iv in professional writing and editingcert iv in professional writing and editing was interesting and enjoyable it was great learning a range of new skills like merging documents and relearning to do mail merge i especially loved the blog and article assessmentsthere were a few issues with links in the work booklets yes you could google them but shouldve ai had to sometimes i just looked at related sites and read themwhere open colleges also fell a bit was communication i found it hard to follow the advice of one trainer until i asked her to spell it out i submitted in my last module the friday before it was due i would understand that it may be a bit late i queried about this via email but no one got back to me
5,01-07-2018,open colleges are fabulous,open colleges are a very open transparent and ethical organizationchoosing them for my study and education has proven to be one of the best decisions i have ever made it has been a really wonderful ridei will be coming back for more thank you open colleges
5,01-07-2018,working at my own pace allowed me to,working at my own pace allowed me to work my study into my own lifestyleaccess to an assessor or trainer was facilitated within a maximum of  days and never seemed like an inconveniencethe repeated assessment requirements of meeting recordings became a little monotonous after the first  perhaps another form of assessment could be developedthe material supplied for each subject was comprehensive and clearoverall a very rewarding project and experience
4,01-07-2018,great with some unhappiness regarding student support team,i did my cert iii in child care with oc and really enjoyed my course  i thought the materials were great and provided all the information i needed for my assignments which were marked within a few days i needed an extension and oc was very supportive and processed it without any trouble trainers were also very supportive and checked in with me towards the end of my course to make sure i would finish in timeonly negative thing sometimes dealing with student support was a bit frustrating and i felt like they were not reading my emails carefully enough and i had to repeat myself a few times before getting the desired resultoverall great course great experience
5,01-07-2018,this was a simple and efficient way to,this was a simple and efficient way to study with every question answered and any problem resolved in no time
4,30-06-2018,good course,good course content and assessors and tutors always availablesome link in the course weren't updated and feels like it was a bit datedi would have liked more video tutorials especially when learning a new tooloverall good experience
5,29-06-2018,good experience and a lot of practice,good experience and a lot of practice for my skill
2,29-06-2018,disappointing,i enrolled with open colleges to complete my certificate for health services assistant the course started off well and i get supported about midway through it became difficult to get in contact with trainers and assessmentsquestions took over a week to get a response in some instances it too weeks i was not supported what so ever with my work placement i organised this myself and started my work placement before the trainers caught up i basically winged it for the first weeks without direction i was very lucky to have a supportive work placement it was at this time i took leave from study as i felt unsupported and frustrated i recently started up again determined to finish my studies ive completed as of today  i found the same issues of delaying in marking disappointing i wouldnt recommend open colleges
1,29-06-2018,the worst school ever,the worst school ever the assessments take up to  weeks or more to be mark then you cannot do other modules while you are waiting then you call and every person tell you something different you send an email and good luck if they answer you quickly days if you complain takes  days for processing and then they moved modules and you keep doing the same modules twice waste of time and money
3,29-06-2018,placement was once in a lifetime experience  fiji,open colleges had some bumpy moments along the coursecommunication hasn't always been great with open collegeshow ever the great thing to come from this is our trip to fiji i made some life long friends and it was an amazing experiencei have also now gone on to do my bachelor of social scienceif you can would totally recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and doing the placement in fiji
5,28-06-2018,open colleges has been amazing to study,open colleges has been amazing to study with i completed an  month course in  months  the teachers are so willing to help you when you need help and you don't feel like you alone with the forum for students to communicate via  will and have already recommended open colleges to propel
5,28-06-2018,i loved my experience with open,i loved my experience with open colleges they were friendly and helpful and the assessors marked my assignments within  business days the only thing was that sometimes i was a bit unsure of what i had to do with placement and a few other things so i had to contact them a bit for help but they were always really helpful on the phone i loved being able to go at my own pace and no deadlines
5,28-06-2018,i just finished my  community service,i just finished my  community service diploma  it  seems unrealmy experience with open college is been amazingfrom start to finish i have had support from open colleges trainers and assessorsopen space is very easy to use and i found the learning material excellent it  was my first experience with online study and i found it excellent as a mum of two and a  part time workerworking for the place where  i did my work placement next week i will enrol at social science welfare degree at csui would highly recommend open colleges
5,28-06-2018,i had a great experience doing my,i had a great experience doing my course through open colleges highly recommend
5,27-06-2018,loved the flexibility of this college,loved the flexibility of this college enrollment was easy instructions clear content engaging and feedback was clear and concise  enjoyed this course
2,27-06-2018,horrible grading times,horrible grading times no support in the sense of letting you know expiration times or seeing if you're on track questions are extremely broad and always require more work that wasn't included to start with no criteria to go off you have to purely guess what they are expectingassessors are nicesupport staff are mostly nicestudy through someone else as most employers no longer like hiring nurses who qualified through oc
1,27-06-2018,only leaving  star because you cant,only leaving  star because you cant leave a  the left hand doesnt talk to the right hand within this rtono support copy paste feedback between studentsfeedback is often barely legible from foreign assessors language barriers so i personally question their knowledge in the industry and is reflected in marking the same answer wrong for a student and right for me for example admin errors and tedious submission procedure for portfolio had my work sit unallocated and unmarked for  weeks before my third contact this time to someone who actually knew what was happening to assist me and action proce is more than double of a reputable organisation such as tafe with only a fraction of the supporti had a friend go through tafe at the same time they will lock you into a contract then not release your results for rpl as they include the portfolio in the unit marks also my cert  material with open colleges was more in depth and demanding than a diploma level students work requirments elsewherei do not recommend this is a business intrested in its bottom line only i will however give full recognition to lyndal wilkins who is genuinely passionate and available for her students and knows her role  and evidently many others  as she was most helpful with every contact
5,26-06-2018,it was hard to get started but once i,it was hard to get started but once i got through the first module it was better each time i contacted support they were really helpful
4,26-06-2018,overall,overall a positive experience  some modules were better structured with clearer instructions than others and there was some repetition  some assessor feedback was very detailed and others minimal so a bit inconsistent  also a selfpaced course with no real deadlines is actually more challenging in terms of motivation than i thought although i didn't need much there seems to be good support available  i am glad i did the course and feel that completing it  is an achievement  i would certainly recommend open colleges
5,26-06-2018,my experience with open colleges was excellent,my experience with open colleges is only positive from my first enquiry into the course i was interested in to the  support i received from the teachers i couldnt have asked for more ive been able to change careers into something i enjoy and its given me the confidence to pursue more education
5,24-06-2018,great tutors and prompt student,great tutors and prompt student services
5,23-06-2018,the support is excellent,the support is excellent from the student support team through to the amazing trainers in particular melissa kenny whos support understanding and guidance was invaluable i am a busy mum of  and run my own business so finding time to study was challenging but melissa helped me get back on track and finish my course i am forever grateful to the team at open collges to have this qualification under my belt and to feel confident to further my career and business
3,22-06-2018,assessments difficult to comprehend,i did enjoy studying with open colleges however i found the assessments to be at times very difficult to understand and a bit all over the place
4,22-06-2018,happy experience,student support very organised and efficient in their knowledge of how to help you out return calls fairly promptly costing for courses at an affordable price compared to other training facilities
1,22-06-2018,excellent course,excellent coursei had a fantastic experience
5,21-06-2018,i had no dramas with oc,i had no dramas with oc they helped me out so much when i needed time away to have a baby n if i needed n extension they were happily enough to give it to me i would like to say the assessor i had were very friendly and were always there if needed i found i had no problems with oc
3,21-06-2018,oc review,overall oc was a good experience and the course had relevant and thorough information the website was a bit buggy at times and wasn't as user friendly as it could be the assessors were generally very good in their responses to my questions but i think it takes them too long to reply because sometimes you can't progress with your assessment until a certain question has been answered on one occasion i waited between  weeks for a response because one of the assessors had quit without informing the students which made it very difficult to get a response for the assessments that he was in charge of this tainted my experience quite a bit
4,21-06-2018,thanks team,thanks team really pleased with your kind assistance and never felt alonei do believe you have to work on simplifying the process of granting rpl and actually have this applied in your gradesgreat communication no long waiting times over the phone overall fine servicethanks roel
2,21-06-2018,i would not study with open colleges,i would not study with open colleges againi had trouble getting responses to my questions from some tutorsi had to chase up the marking of some assignments which were not marked within the specified time periodi was left wondering about the absence of one tutor who simply disappeared seemingly with no arrangements in place for someone else to take over his responsibilities nor his messagesi asked questions for clarification of one tutor who did not have an exceptional command of the english language and received responses that were confusingi worked on one financial assessment for a couple of months reworking it several times as i could not get my figures to balance after finally submitting the assessment anyway i was told that there were errors in the assessment and i should have had a newer copy which had not been provided to me student support disputed the tutor's claim that the new assessment had even been produced i submitted a formal complaint regarding this issuewith other assessments i was frustrated by poorly written content in addition to simple typographical errors in some cases the information given was actually wrong compared with official government informationdo yourself a favour do not study with this organisation it is an absolute shambles
5,21-06-2018,loved it,i just completed cert iv in design specialising in photography i learnt a lot and loved being able to do it at my own pace my questions were always answered promptly by my trainer who gave good feedback and direction and did a great job of instilling confidence as a result i've already started picking up work within the industry
5,20-06-2018,thanks for a positive experience,open colleges was a fantastic experience for me after not studying for  years i thought i might find things overwhelming but the webinars assessors and support staff were there for me every step of the wayi would highly recommend them to anyone considering furthering their education
1,19-06-2018,my experience with open colleges has,my experience with open colleges has been horrific from beginning to endwell almost the end if they would give me the diploma  communication is pathetic course content largely irrelevant and i will not ever recommend  open colleges
1,19-06-2018,appalling,i am appalled by the lack of urgency support and professionalism from open colleges it is literally impossible to contact any of the assessors or trainers for assistance whether it be via email openspace message or phone and no one ever gets back to you one of their policies specifies a within  days turnaround time for the workplace approval form to be returned well it's almost  days later and not only am i still waiting for mine to be returned but the email i sent  days ago regarding this is also being ignored open colleges are the absolute worst i regret paying  to study their diploma of community services i will never recommend open colleges to anyone
4,19-06-2018,overall,overallstudying through open colleges was a pleasant experienceonline studying was tough  not through open colleges as such but in general studying online required persistence dedication and drive to really reach for your study goal which in my case was to become a veterinary nurseive learnt a mountain more in a physical environment than i ever did studying online  but im thankful that i have an incredibly awesome workplace and team that have taught meso much i definitely could have benefited more from facetoface training and student groups but was limited to such resources from studying online this wasnt open colleges fault as these resources are of limits due to the course being delivered onlineas far as assistance from the open colleges team is concerned i was overall very satisfied with the assistance and guidance i received from mainly stephanie vallance although i did speak to a number of assessors throughout my course they were all very helpful with the answers to my concerns and always pointed me in the direction i wasseekingone very little concern i did have was the wording of some of the portfolio questions i found some of the activities a little difficult to interpret and understand of what was expected on the other hand this made me research the question more and provide lots of detailed information which luckily paid off for most of my portfolio questions i just think that going forward a more simplified expectation of the assessment questions will benefit other future nurses to fully understand what is required  so that the lovely assessors arent being bombarded on facebook and on openspace unnecessarily
5,19-06-2018,great scheme,great scheme recommend highly
4,18-06-2018,supportive staff,supportive staff i found the staff especially jana nettleship to be very helpful and supportive throughout this learning journey thankyou
5,18-06-2018,creative writing success,i completed the creative writing course and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it it was simple to navigate the portals and as a mature student this was important to me robert my trainer always gave such great feedback that truly made me think about my writing and try to improve it through his suggestions the turnaround for marking was also excellent usually within  hours couldnt recommend open colleges highly enough thank you
5,10-08-2018,don't do it,nightmare you pay thousands of dollars to train yourself
4,16-06-2018,honestly was a great course,honestly was a great course my assor was great and always very helpful the work wasn't to hard but some of it was very confusing and hard to do in my opinion this was because the assessment should have been done differently but overall i loved working with open collages
5,15-06-2018,great organisation for external learning,fantastic organisation for external learning as long as you have the motivation to keep up to date and on track they have the resources and support to help you achieve your goals
5,15-06-2018,just do it,my course was fully online no campus attendance and so convenient i was so happy that open colleges offered the course and that it was nationally accredited the only thing i would say is that if your course doesn't have assignment deadlines mine didn't  just overall course end date you need to be very organised and selfdisciplined to complete ittrainers were great course materials were great i have no regrets and i feel industryready
5,14-06-2018,i thoroughly enjoyed my course throughopen college,i thoroughly enjoyed my course through open college there was always support available and the course material and way it was payed out was great and easy to managethanks so much
2,13-06-2018,poor course content and assessments,poor course content and assessments the whole course needs to be rewritten there are many spelling mistakes and wrong answers on assessments  hr lockouts on quizzes ultimately you will get the job done but it will frustrate you no end if i didnt have comprehensive training within my organisation then i would have really struggled to complete this courseon a positive note i now have my cert and i can get a better paying job
5,13-06-2018,lifechanging fiji work placement experience,i'd recently come back from completing my work placement in fiji arranged by open colleges and acata this was one of the most rewarding experiences of my lifethe project had so much purpose to it that i forgot it was part of my work placement we were literally changing people's lives through counselling sessions based on a healthier lifestyle i was able to initiate client empowerment confidence and a personcentred approach the homestay family were so welcoming and accommodating and also respectful of my space the facilitators were so supportive and eliminated any anxiety i had from the moment i arrived i have now made friends for life with the students i worked with they were all so supportive and caringi would highly recommend completing your work placement for counselling in fiji
4,12-06-2018,cassandra and meghan are absolutely,cassandra and meghan are absolutely wonderful so helpful it was a real pleasure working with them
4,12-06-2018,my experience with open colleges was a positive and negative one,my experience with open colleges was a good one i could study in my own time and get my assessments graded really quicklythe only negative part for me were i got offered  short courses for free and i thought i could do these within the length of my course turns out i had to pick them before  months so i lost one chance i confronted a few team members and got told sorry cant help you i was not impressed and you should give warnings out or reminders out
5,12-06-2018,great place to study,great place to study excellent teachers  always help available if needed
3,12-06-2018,the people in your call centre are,the people in your call centre are rude unprofessional and have never answered my queries the fact that i had paid my course in full and still could not access all modules is both inconvenient and pointlessresponses from student support take too long and in one case i had to send three follow up emails to get a responsei dont believe that the course i completed was worth paying k for as the content was not spectacular and all of the resources were mostly old you tube videos which i did not find useful when completing quizes or assessments if you want to charge people that much for a cert iv make it worthwhile
5,12-06-2018,trainers and assessors were exremely,trainers and assessors were exremely helpful and responded to my queries very promptly overall i had exceptional service and would recommend open colleges to anyone for anyone experiencing problems i would suggest that you email your assessors in the first instance dont get caught in the whole moaning and  groaning club you will gain more from dealing with your assessor
2,11-06-2018,course structure ok open colleges communication terrible,i was sold a course that was not fully written with no mention of it being incomplete on two occasions i had to wait several weeks for course material to become available which delayed my studies on neither occasion did oc contact me to inform me of when the course work would be availablethe course material had lots of errors broken links missing images and incomplete textthe feedback from assessors was very limited often they just repeated the requirement of the assessment back to you and stated whether or not you had done itabout halfway through the course they increased the turn around time on assessment responses from  days to  working days with no explanation warning or notice to studentsthe course graphic design diploma itself covers a good range of topics and the assessments are a good framework by which to progress practical skillsoverall the course structure is ok however communication from oc is terrible
1,08-06-2018,open colleges is a disgrace to education,i would not even recommend it to my worst enemy this course was okay the material and assessments are the same stuff over and over again if you need help your trainers take forever to reply and student support are rude and not helpful at all the modules themselves are worded in ways hardly anyone understands and are honestly pathetic there is no communication between any of the staff i was told one thing by support and another by trainers when they finally got back to me everyone uses a different marking grade ie unsatisfactory or incomplete there is a difference and the trainersassessors do not mark it according to these the process for work placement is a joke honestly am very upset i wasted my time energy and money to do this course it was an extremely bad experience and has made me think long and hard weather or not i will ever study again i will definitely not be studying with open colleges in the future
5,08-06-2018,my career is to be an animal care specialist at a vet,my career is to be an animal care specialist at a vet i was devastated to find that all the animal studies courses that i wanted to do i do because of either distance or some other reason but then i thought maybe there there is an online tafe that will have an animal studies coursei came across open colleges and saw that they have animal studies i had my eye on certificate in animal care i so want to work with you guys after seeing info online and everything i could possibly need to study for was right in front of me i just had to look thank you for being the only good place for me to achieve my career you guys are life savers
4,07-06-2018,good content,good content some modules were really long and repetitive but heaps of client examples was good
5,07-06-2018,i had no real issues throughout the,i had no real issues throughout the course accessing downloading and uploading assessments i think the only issues i had was because my course had expired and i was not aware then emails starting bouncing and communication slowed down students may need to get advice that their course is expiring soon or maybe it's because i had a different email address i did have issues with uploading my first video even after condensing the video with the software that you recommended clipchamp but you must of allowed for more memory because i had no issues with my next video
3,07-06-2018,really enjoyed studying with open,really enjoyed studying with open colleges online good support while completing my modules assessors are very nice and do their best to help you feel at ease course is laid out nicely and is easy to follow took a while sometimes to mark assessments and trouble uploading videos big files etc and would have liked a bit more support while on work placement overall i am happy with the course through open colleges and would study with them again
1,06-06-2018,i will never study online again,i got tricked into signing up when the staff told me there would always be somebody there between am and pm to answer my call and help me later on i found out they can't help with anything academic well after i've already given you my money what else would i be needing help with other than something academic later when i was having trouble understanding questions i would book special appointments to get help then i would get the answers wrong with the help that they provided i even had to explain the question to the specialist because i could see they didn't even understand it i spent more time trying to resolve problems than i did learning and most of the activities in the module had links that were down when i called for help i was told to google the answer as the reading material was not relevant i must have been told to google the answer about  times  finally after  months of stress and continual  complaining i got assigned a special person to help me if you work and only have set days off this course is not for you as it takes days and days for an answer to a question and your one day off that you have between shifts that you devoted to study and assignments is waisted i will never study online again
5,06-06-2018,the interior design and decorating,the interior design and decorating course was very challenging in many ways  however the staff where amazingly helpful and the support networks set up are a great asset i have spoken to so many talented designers and seen so many student produce some amazing design i love this area of work and would like to thank open colleges for being so helpful and supportive in getting me through the course
4,05-06-2018,open colleges,great training provider
5,05-06-2018,a great experience all round,a great experience all round thoroughly enjoyed the course and content and everything about open colleges
5,04-06-2018,i never thought i was ever going to,i never thought i was ever going to finish the course but with the support from your team i successfully finished i can not thank you guys enough for the support i was given big thank you to holly and rosalie i highly recommend open college
4,04-06-2018,my over all experience with open,my over all experience with open colleges has been a good one i have recieved lots of support and guidance from both staff and assessorsthe highlight of my experience was the acata fiji project that i was able to experience as my work placement in may  it was a wonderful experience and i  recommend the course for that experience alone
5,02-06-2018,everything was great,everything was great support from everyone at open colleges was wonderful would study again with them for sure
5,02-06-2018,i highly recommend open colleges,a very rich content and really comprehensive assesments that allow to deepen the topics by implementing them the support of the teachers is great their answers very fast feedback after the assessments are also very complete and can really progress
1,02-06-2018,not happy with oc,some trainers were great but i feel like it was made so difficult to get help having to send two or three messages and not even receiving help and if we need to extend or in my case get my certificate sent to me at my new address it costs money you make  odd dollars per student the least you could do is help us out and just resend it surely that  would cover extension costs and resend of certificate another money hungry company in my opinion would not reccomend
5,01-06-2018,acata trust fiji workplace experience diploma of counselling,i am in the last stages of finishing a diploma of counselling recently open colleges provided the opportunity through acata trust fiji to complete my work placement in fiji as a volunteer providing nutritional counselling to the local people i highly recommend this placement opportunity it is a great place to start exercising learnt skills in the workplace while being in a supportive environment of peers oc staff and the warm fijian people it will certainly change your perspective as it has mine
5,01-06-2018,great education experience,studying through open colleges has been a great experience the trainers and staff are very helpful and i found it made it a lot easier when studying online
5,31-05-2018,love the flexibility and great level of,love the flexibility and great level of experienceall staff are amazing
3,31-05-2018,convenient and flexible not well organised,the flexibility with these types of courses is great  not having due dates on assessments and all the content available online was fantastic i don't think i would have been able to manage a course whilst working fulltime through any other meanson the negative end of things some of the content was not relevant and links were not kept up to date the assessment and learning material was full of grammatical errors and typos and was clearly not proofread very well i'd love to see a better approach to the community experience as there is next to none in open space and students have taken it into their own hands to make facebook groups to work around it there were also annoying complications when the course changed part way through  this could not be helped though the process was not handled very well
5,31-05-2018,i am so happy i studied my cert iii in,i am so happy i studied my cert iii in ed support with open colleges i found this college professional and friendly the online course structure was easy to follow i had so much immediate support and constructive feedback from the trainers  assessors thank you and now that i've finished i feel satisfied with my growth and knowledge and i've broken through so many study barriers i'd happily study again  an overall extremely beneficial and pleasant experience thank you to all who were involved in my study journey
4,31-05-2018,pleased to have completed my cert,pleased to have completed my cert assignments were marked quickly and feedback helpful
4,31-05-2018,counsellingmake a difference,the most valuable  part was being involved in the fiji project for work placement it was a key aspect in cementing my theory with the practical components fully supported by the tutors and organisers all while helping the fijian community even though online can test your patience at time it will teach you resilience and flexibility within yourself
5,31-05-2018,i was very happy with the course and,i was very happy with the course and everything they delivered in the class its full of information which help us when we do our placement thanks to the educators for giving us best knowledge and information during the class which make the placement very easier fir the students i would definitely recommend to other to enroll in open college because this college is the best of best
5,31-05-2018,life is what you make of itso is education,open colleges not only gave me the opportunity to reshape my learning behaviour and follow my dreams but also supported me throughout every difficulty that any student studying in any format would experiencemy diploma of counselling ended up taking  years to complete and if it wasn't for open colleges staff i'm sure i would have given up and dropped out instead i was given an extension and encouraged to continue which led to me being able to complete my work placement in fiji a life changing experienceoften in life we hear the quote life is what you make of it well so is our education we can either view every disappointment and setback as the end of the world or we can learn from it and become better students and more patient humans
4,30-05-2018,early education and care,early education and careat the start of my diploma i struggled i was ready to quit i pushed through even though the course is hard i have learnt a great deal for my role
2,29-05-2018,won't be studying with open colleges again,most of not all of the assessors didn't give good quality feedback some of  the feedback said i needed to redo entire assignments because i had made a spelling error i was doing an accounting course but the feedback i was given was riddled with spelling and grammar errors and really difficult to read the support team that you ring were very helpful if you have anxiety about studying i would not recommend open colleges i didn't find them helpful at all i had assignment parts that confused me so i messaged my assessor for explanation and showed them what i had already done so that if it was wrong i wouldn't have to completely redo it all they said no i can't help you until you submit your assignment then i'll give you feedback i felt like this wasn't ok so i messaged support and they just said to speak with my assessor i feel like open colleges puts their head in the sand when it comes to their assessors course material is full of referencing errors broken links and links to lowquality youtube videos let alone grammar and spelling errors i won't be studying with them again and i have told as many people as i can to not study with them i am very surprised they are still recognised as a training provider
5,29-05-2018,great,i found the assessors to be extremely helpful and prompt
3,29-05-2018,lots of room for improvement,i enjoyed the course and all the information was relevant and well organised the online site was easy to use and well explained i had an incredibly hard time getting help when needed emails were not effective i ended up having to call to get any kind of assistance or any kind of a reply to be fair getting a reply from anyone after money was handed over took a lot of effort and time
5,28-05-2018,yes i would and have recommended open,yes i would and have recommended open colleges to other people wanting to further there education
4,28-05-2018,open colleges encouraged me to get,open colleges encouraged me to get through with my assessments very helpful student support that responded immediately thank a lot
2,28-05-2018,do a degree at uni it will be easier,your additional resources are an absolute waste of time  of them just repeated the questions from the assignment why not just add the minimal comments that are useful to the assignments assignments are poorly written and it often took me longer to decipher what you actually needed than to do the assignment itself fyi  i scored distinctions and above for all but  assignment so its not my lack of ability website open space is extremely frustrating to use activities are not embedded within course content so they constantly pop up and make you loose your spot  extremely frustrating when trying to ref material quickly this issue was raised numerous times with no improvements made in addition to  community comments also pop up these were never useful to me and were a constant annoyance create a link to them and if people want to see them they can given more time i do have plenty more to sayoverall  not an enjoyable experience and will not be recommending
1,28-05-2018,just don't do it,just don't do it i am speechless with how unprofessional and how much this course costs for over  years i have been battling to try and get my diploma i just feel like crying had to restart a few times unable to upload assessments and trainers and assessors not getting back to you it's never clear who to contact for help this company has put me off doing any further study in the future
5,28-05-2018,did the introduction to creative,did the introduction to creative writing course it was great as a general look at different forms of writing including non fiction and poetry but not particularly specific to anything in general  this limited its relevance to someone looking for something more specializedthe reason for my star rating was the feedback received the trainer engaged really well with everything submitted and went above and beyond to give thoughtful detailed and constructive feedback for my work this meant that even the assignments which i wasn't interested in were very useful to me because of the criticism i received with each
4,27-05-2018,i felt there was a lot a double,i felt there was a lot a double handling in regard to my subjects from my initial assessments and then additional work with the huge detailed portfolio requirements
5,26-05-2018,awesome experience,friendly and very helpful team at open colleges i am glad i went to them when i decided to do an online course
5,24-05-2018,its an excellent company,its an excellent company the way the courses are set out are really informative and accessibleresponse time between myself and trainer was exceptional honest reviews and feedback student support also helped in a tremendous way to help me complete my course in time
1,24-05-2018,scam scam scam,paid  for some online quizzes i will be taking this matter to court they have stuffed me around for months and didnt even reply until i wrote a formal complaint do not give your money to them they are a money hungry cooperation who discriminate and take advantage of peoples ages i am a hard working  years old and  is a life time of money to me i will not stand for this and will make sure the company pays for what they have put me through you have be warned they are a scam do not trust them
4,24-05-2018,big positives minor negatives,overall the course was well structured and easy to follow from introductory to more advanced levels content was diverse and covered many applications of webdevelopment and associated fields the facilitators were always helpful and communicated quickly in general marking and feedback was fair and provided constructive criticism and encouragementdownsides included finding it difficult to gauge my own progress relative to an average or other standard although i understand this is typical of self guided online learning in generalalso felt that more weight was given to subjects with less relevance to onthejob webdevelopment and conversely too little focus and depth was provided to some subjects which would be job criticaldespite these reservations would recommend the course
5,23-05-2018,i could recommend open colleges to,i could recommend open colleges to everyone i know
4,23-05-2018,open colleges has made my dream of graphic design come true,open colleges has made my dream of getting that piece of paper real  as long as you are motivated and passionate about what you do  you will ace itthe support staff were fantastic and very helpful all the way througha lot of spelling mistakes and missing links in the materials tend to make me think it's a bit of a 'set and forget' type of course though which is why i've given it  stars instead of
5,23-05-2018,a great way to study at home at your,a great way to study at home at your pace
5,23-05-2018,found it hard to go back to studies but,found it hard to go back to studies but had great educators that made the process easy for me with there great support thanks open colleges
2,23-05-2018,some information was outdated,some information was outdated and had a lot of problems with one assessment not being up to standard multiple times when my study buddy had the same answers as me took a long time for assessors to answer my queries sosometimes had to send them multiple emails
5,23-05-2018,indepth course covering very relevant,indepth course covering very relevant job specific content  excellent and challenging
3,23-05-2018,alright service,open colleges was alrightaverage i found a few of the asessors to be harder to talk with then others and also very hard to get in contact with
5,23-05-2018,highly recommend,thoroughly enjoyed studying with open colleges would highly recommend suppprt from teachers was excellent
3,23-05-2018,got there in the end,i did not have a bad experience but was very difficult to stay motivated there is learning support available but it is slow and not overly helpful especially when the learning content is limited and the questions are not always clear
5,21-05-2018,you guys were awesome to study through,you guys were awesome to study through always willing to help
5,21-05-2018,open colleges,support staff helped to ensure course was completed course structure is good materials are relevant assessors are available and willing to help
5,21-05-2018,i found open colleges very good i,i found open colleges very good i learnt a lot i now have a job i would recommend open colleges  out of
4,20-05-2018,im really enjoying studying diploma of,im really enjoying studying diploma of community services open space is great student support and trainers are lovely and very helpful great flexibility  you do need to be self motivated and prepared to researchi love im able to juggle work family life and study only dig i can have is i wish we got text books and it sometimes takes a while for trainers to reply
4,20-05-2018,the course was great,the course was great  i must admit some of the material needs to be updated  started out using pinterest for feedback and found it to be quite difficult  half way thru they started using facebook which was a much easier way  but the course document to need to reflect this  the trainers were fantastic with help thu out  finished with a day to spare
4,19-05-2018,doing this course has taught me so much,doing this course has been an interesting journey for me when first starting the course i felt excited but was also overwhelmed and anxious as i had never completed any online study it was challenging to motivate myself at times but i set very specific study goals and was rewarded with some excellent grades for my efforts after completing each module it helped me to keep the momentum going the webinars for each module were so useful in helping me to complete my assessments i would recommend that everyone doing this course watches them all the support team trainers assessors and other students have all helped to guide me along the way i was extremely nervous about doing my work placement because although i had done well in the theory there were no guarantees that i would do well in the practical or that i would even enjoy it i made the decision to complete all of my elective subjects before my work placement which was the best decision i could have made and wouldrecommend doing this to otherstudents i had a few technical glitches along the way but always managed to resolve them quite quickly i am really looking forward to the journey ahead of me now i have been offered a job where i completed my work placement and feel so proud of myself for completing this course i have really enjoyed the whole learning experience
4,18-05-2018,great course content and loved how you,great course content and loved how you could work at your own pace as well staff were good to deal with and answered questions promptly as well
3,17-05-2018,the course information was very helpful,the course information was very helpful and gave me a good basic understanding of interior design i was lead to believe i was signing up for a series of video tuitions  i would like to have had a bit more visual assistance i also found it a little confusing to understand the full length of the course and how much further i had to go to finish the course information says to use the fabric selector and the fabric swatches that i received with my course information i do not have these
2,17-05-2018,think twice before going with open colleges,probably the only positive to studying with open colleges was the fact that the course was delivered entirely online enabling me to fit it in around my other commitments however this also worked against me when it came to securing the required work experience as open colleges had little to no credibility with prospective employers i should mention here that open colleges did eventually step in to assist with finding a host organisation and i cannot fault the efforts of roberto in this respect the course content was ok but the wording of the assessments was ambiguous there was a lot of down time waiting for grading of assessments in order to move to the next module there was poor communication between the various sectors of the college and even between the individuals within a sector if i'd known all this i would have chosen a different rto
4,16-05-2018,i believe this was an amazing,i believe this was an amazing experience and i'm glad i chose open colleges to complete my studies i got great support from those who helped the only thing i dislike was the grading where it took to long to grade my assessments but other then that it was a great experience with open colleges
3,16-05-2018,some improvements needed,in general the staff at open colleges are very helpful  friendly the course material could be laid out in an easier to understand format though i found it a little frustrating that open space didn't update to reflect the course material completed it would be handy to have a screen that shows you all of the modules you've completed in the one place also some of the websites that you need to click on within the course material have broken links  can't be opened or are for out dated websites that no longer have the material needed
2,16-05-2018,i would not recommend open colleges for,i would not recommend open colleges for studying personal care work unless you are already in the industry the administration of the course was chaotic and the course itself did not prepare me well for the workplace
4,16-05-2018,i enrolled in the diphr management,i enrolled in the diphr management course  i never went to uni and was not a studious person in high school with working and raising my children now behind me i decided to embark on this course to aid in my current position  whilst the questions were quite ambigous and left me pouring over google chat groups and asking peers i found the research quite beneficial  i was pleasantly surprised with each result i achieved  i ended up taking approx  months break throughout the course but still managed to complete it with  months to spare  i think working in the hr environment assisted with me in completing and understanding the material  david lang has been fabulous to me throughout this journey  his comments on  my assessments were very encouraging and to receive a personal call to advise i had graduated was a lovely personal touch  thank you  whilst it is difficult waiting for a grade patiently i understand there are many students with assignments of varying complexities so understand turn around can be approx  days  thank you david and open colleges  now for the next chapter
1,16-05-2018,regretful,has been a nightmare since the beginning turnaround times and responses from assessors is poor not to mention the amount of times the site has gone down very difficult to get any form of assistance constantly being bounced from one person to the other
2,15-05-2018,study at tafe not online,although the team at student support was fabulous and extremely helpful and patient the course itself was so poorly set out with the questions being so vague that no student has a chance at answering anything the 'correct' way the first time they say 'two year course' try  years warning the marking process can take up to  weeks each time something is submittedi was told it was 'so easy studying online with open colleges everything can just be uploaded onto the site in the areas provided' this is wrong so so wrong i spent  on usb's because the open colleges site does not allow you to upload your work as the files are too bigalso each marker marking the portfolio should have one set of marking criteria not a different one per student this is both unfair and cruelstudy at tafe people they are more open minded and it will actually only be  years
5,15-05-2018,staff were excellent and the course was,staff were excellent and the course was well set out and easy to manage your time around
4,15-05-2018,recommended for online study,recommended for online studyi choose open colleges to complete my cert iv in bookkeeping because of the fact that it's all online you aren't bound to semester dates and it was one of the more cost effective options i did look at tafes but they were more expensive and not flexible the staff are very helpful albeit there seems to be quite a turnover of staff some minor mistakes in some of the materials but all in all easy to interact with

5,11-05-2018,would use open colleges again,would use open colleges again the assessors were always there to help
1,11-05-2018,i will not recommend open colleges to anyone,the study material provided is very poor quality i attempted to complete couple of modules and found that videos and material provided online is link of youtube videos from usa with very poor quality some of this is not relevant to australia which is very confusing i also tried to complete assessment and was unable to do so it did not matter what answer i provided to some questions it did not work i attempted it several times by changing my answers i also tried to contact support team but never heard back from themi signed up for their course with expectation that the course will be high standard and paid  but the quality of service and course is not acceptable total wastage of money and time i am not alone there are several online forums and reviewing sites where people have expressed same views about open colleges due to these issues i requested for refund but they have refused to give me my money back i will not recommend open colleges to anyone
3,11-05-2018,study at own pace,i liked that i could study at my own pace the help desk were good at replying but no help on weekends  some parts of the reading material was missing i really appreciated them helping me out when i had taken time off from my job to get study done it can be difficult not being in a classroom situation when you need clarification or questions answered
1,10-05-2018,i found my experience with open colleges incredibly painfull,i found my experience with open colleges incredibly painful there is little to no guidance when completing the vet nurse certificate  questions in the portfolio are vague and do not provide any guidance as to how much detail is expected literally setting you up to fail  the variation in marking efficiency is a joke when comparing my portfolio to another and then once you do finally manage to submit the ridiculously huge body of work it takes half a year to get it marked i would not recommend open colleges to anyone
2,10-05-2018,i did not enjoy my experience with open,i did not enjoy my experience with open colleges and will not study with them again in the futurethroughout my entire course i found the trainers and support available very limited and not resourcefulmy practical assessment on the job site for my structured workplace component was a horrible experienceafter completing my diploma a couple months ago i still have not received the documentation and have been told via support multiple time incorrectly that it was sent to now be told by them it was never actually dispatched very confusing i do appreciate the individuals who have made the effort and supported me along the way
4,10-05-2018,excellent,great coursei did my diploma of business through open colleges and found them excellent along with doing the course at my own pace they were always available to answer questions and i had no issues throughout my course would highly recommend

4,09-05-2018,i had very little interaction with the,i had very little interaction with the college because i found the course very easy to follow  i was disappointed that the assignments were not harder but they were obviously automated marks  i did learn quite a bit but was also disappointed that the course did not address window treatments in any way
5,09-05-2018,i have been supported through out my,i have been supported through out my course by the trainers and assessors and am sure i will be back for another course i would recommend this organization
2,08-05-2018,assessments,assessments are very poorly put together not clear questions and even some outdated tax and payroll rules great that assessments can be redone but if you submit something then get asked to redo two things then get a hd obviously you passed with the first submission so wasted a lot of time fixing minor things didnt have anyone contact me to check in on progress only got bombarded with emails of expiring course and given the option to extend for a fee
4,08-05-2018,very relevant content for understanding,very relevant content for understanding and contributing in the industry  good content and support  some of the modules seemed to lack as much depth or information as others  some assessment questions lacked clarity  i think that can happen more when studying in isolation ie not getting feedback from general classroom discussion but support from the trainer is readily available and excellent when sought
5,08-05-2018,open colleges was flexible,open colleges was flexible  i found the course and content informative and the teachers and staff were excellent at helping if i needed a hand

2,07-05-2018,i studied allied health assistance,i studied allied health assistance specialising in speech therapy they were very unhelpful money hungry and take too long for help through student support  if you have never studied online before i suggest choosing someone else  they changed my course  months in and i didn't get any rpls had to start from scratch they told me they knew about the changes before i paid upfront but couldn't tell me about ittheir online portal is easy to follow and navigate howevere if i didn't have support from other frustrated peers over facebook i would never have got through the course wouldn't use open colleges again
3,07-05-2018,i found the course to be acceptable,i found the course to be acceptable the work placement is the place where you learn the most more than the actual material supplied by the workbookthe assessors were good lauri steel was amazing with her communication and invaluable resources she definitely deserves  stars fiona kelly was also good at motivating me and very kind with her feedback which made me happythe course is more set up so that you have to work by yourself the assessment questions were sometimes worded in ways in which you couldnt understand what exactly they were looking for and if you asked what it meant you wouldnt get an answer for three days and by then youd just guessedin the end though i learnt a lot and thats the main thing i would recommend it to people who are capable of working by themselves and dont need their hand held through the entire course
5,07-05-2018,love everything about it,loved everything about it support help and information that was given great feedback from tutors
4,06-05-2018,loved the online platform to do at my,loved the online platform to do at my own time very important as i am working full time i am a mature student looking to change careers and found this method of study excellent i arranged all my workplacement which was invaluable as i was offered work with them only downfall i found was the online assessor allocated to me only worked two days a week and was very difficult to contact resulting in delays with getting my certificate at the end very frustrating as i had a job offer waiting
5,06-05-2018,challenging but inspirational,i found it easy to navigate the support was great and the assessments were of a language to understand and upload  the turnaround time for marking for fantastic
4,06-05-2018,very understanding and supporting,very understanding and supporting staff showed patience and willingness to work with students
5,04-05-2018,awesome lecturers,awesome lecturers excellent delivery
2,03-05-2018,course really should not have been,course really should not have been offered in the first place as there are too few placement opportunities in the country prospective students need to be better informed about this before being signed up communication and marking of assessments very slow
4,03-05-2018,open colleges,pros course work was well laid out easy to understandcons video and audio files were harder to submit support staff kept changing
2,03-05-2018,i would rate my experience with open colleges as forgettable,i would rate my experience with open colleges as average i would not recommend others to study online with them the whole experience was very laborious  frustrating just before christmas  my trainer who was great went to only working  days a week and was so busy he had difficulty keeping up with the workload and responding to emails or requests the time taken for assessment results to be given is way too long  business days i have a friend who studied with another online provider  was given results  feedback within  hours it made the whole process of studying and trying to keep motivated on my studies very difficult
4,02-05-2018,great experience,i found support and all of the trainers very helpfulall the learning materials were relevant and i found the website easy to navigate and usewould recommend to anyone who are time poor and can't attend a campus to do training online
5,01-05-2018,super user friendly,the course was presented in a very easy to understand format the communication with the support staff was brilliant plenty of resources to access as well as where to find further information completely on my terms in relation to study and completion all in all a brilliant way to study learn and gain qualificationsi highly recommend open colleges for everyone looking to gain further qualifications or just starting back into study they make it so easy to learn
3,01-05-2018,work placement,work placementi struggled finding work placement on the gold coast it took me nearly a year to finally get an organisation to accept me the experience was very average i reached out to open colleges but realised very quickly that i was on my own in this challengerecently i found the ohana this dynamic organisation on the gold coast relies on qualified mentors to assist at their school and their gen z program they require you to attend a free  day seminar before they accept you into the program this seminar along with mentor hours qualifies for the work placementit would be great if open colleges could recommend ohana for anyone looking for someplace to do their hours
5,01-05-2018,great experience,great experience got the skills and qualification i needed easy to use website and easy to contact lecturer's when needed
2,01-05-2018,errors in course material,errors in course materiallack of information in assessments and poorly writtenlack of online supportinterface not fully functional
4,01-05-2018,my experience with open colleges was,my experience with open colleges was positive and was a good learning experience for someone like me who was completing a course online for the first time
3,30-04-2018,very hard to learn via distance,very hard to learn via distance support arent trained in specific areas of study therefore cant help you with anything your having trouble with
3,30-04-2018,i didnt like how one of the first,i didnt like how one of the first modules were made up of accounting basics i didnt understand the material provided didnt explain much it seemed they assumed we already know stuff like creditdebit balance i had to spend a lot of time reading up on the internet and searching youtube videos about it i also didnt like how some modules didnt have much to do with actual accounting and felt that time could have been used to do more hands on stuff after completion of my course i dont feel confidant at all stepping into the workforce even as a junior position the replies from some teachers took couple days as well it is particularly inconvenient if you are trying to finish your assessment on time
3,29-04-2018,great resources  terrible staff support,this was a great way to earn your certificate iv from home great information and work placement modules but in saying that staff will at times take weeks to respond to enquiries or mark your assessments it can be very difficult to get in touch with professors and at times the modules are laid out poorly or grammar is incorrect i am thankful that i already work in this field as it may have been sincerely difficult it hadn't due to the lack of support i don't recommend this if you don't already work in this field
2,27-04-2018,my honest experience is i would look at alternative providers,my honest experience is  it didn't start off well upon enquiring about this course i specifically questioned recognition of prior learning information the sales person told me they can do it there is no extra cost and i just submit the rpl at the start of each module turns out the information given to me to seal the deal was wrong after having paid the amount in full i was not able to get a refund i had many words with management who didn't believe me after submitting the rpl it took  months to get feedback i was unable to commence any studies until i knew which modules i would get rpl for again after many talks with management and appologies i was given a  month extension added on to the course length no that it was needed throughout the course the grammer and mistakes are pretty noticeable poor for a education provider support was ok throughout depending on who you got to finish i was so excited then the emails started coming in saying now you are in rolled in the next part of the course pardon i did all the modules on the brochure i called support who said oh no you have another  modules to go i sent the email confirmation i had showing what i was sold i couldn't sleep that night i didn't want to do another two years the next day i rang support again to further find out that the emails and information i was given is wrong i have finished soo the answer to the question 'would i recommend open colleges' no i certainly would not
4,26-04-2018,i found it easy to complete my course,i found it easy to complete my course with open colleges and although i had some personal stuff happen during my course which put me off my studies for a while they were very accommodating in allowing me an extension the only thing i didn't like were the evidence components required of some assisgnmemts video and audio as being new to melbourne from overseas it was not easy for me to find participants to help me complete them and i didn't truly see how they were helping me learn that was the only drawback i found otherwise i would highly recommend gaining your qualifications through open colleges
5,24-04-2018,would use open space again,the material was easy to follow  and the website was  easy to navigate my only complaints would be the mail box because you can't delete old messages and how slow it is to upload files
5,24-04-2018,thanks open college,easy to follow good material
4,23-04-2018,i very much enjoyed doing this course,i very much enjoyed doing this course and loved learning about the digestive system and my two electives  chronic diseases and health education promotion  i was very impressed with the learning material content although some of it needs to be upgraded where links to websites have been disbanded  some of the assignments took up an excessive amount of time that i hadnt anticipated on  i was paranoid about sticking to the    words required only to find that i was required to go over this to answer the questions completely  i was privileged to have mary as my trainer with her helpful friendly feedback
5,22-04-2018,learning through open colleges was,learning through open colleges was great everyone was incredibly helpful and made it easy to manage work and study
4,21-04-2018,the diploma in management  supervision,the diploma in management  supervision provided me with a huge amount of relevant work place management knowledge this knowledge has benefited both me and my company as i have introduced many of the concepts that i learned about during my studies i now have a much greater appreciation of what a good supervisor  manager is expected to do in managing both people customers and the businessthe course is only as good as the effort you put in to researching and understanding the contenthighly recommend the course for those that want to develop their knowledge of supervising and management
5,21-04-2018,highly recommended,i would honestly recommend open colleges to anyone ive tried to study online before but it was always too confusing open colleges is super easy and straight forward to use and i have just completed my very first online coursethere is a lot of support for students and staff are always friendly
4,21-04-2018,would recommend open colleges,it's great having support throughout the studying however it is hard until you find study buddies etc did find that when asking trainers for help on questions didn't explain much so was still a bit confused would recommend open colleges to anyone looking to study
5,20-04-2018,very satisfied student,i am very satisfied with open college i was able to finish my certificate in digital photography and i can say that because i did it in my own phasing i was able to understand clearly my lessons thank to the intructors who honestly and persistently guided me throughout the course
5,20-04-2018,i very enjoy the method used by the,i very enjoy the method used by the open college as we submit the entire work on a set date which allows us to study at our own pace and improve our time management skills without the feeling of pressure my experience has been excellent and therefore i am looking forward to apply for future courses once i complete the current diploma
1,20-04-2018,absolute nightmare,absolute nightmare do not do this course through open colleges
5,20-04-2018,this was a great course for anyone,this was a great course for anyone wanting to get there teeth into business good course material easy to follow and very knowledgeable assessors
4,20-04-2018,i was happy with the course outline,i was happy with the course outline however when i had finished the course there is a lack of information on what happens next i received the review prior to receiving any communications from open colleges it was days later that i received an email letting me know my certificate will be sent out shortly
5,18-04-2018,student support staff were always,student support staff were always helpful and assessors provided genuine feedback and mentoring
5,18-04-2018,hard work and patience pays off,though studying through correspondence is hard and there is life you have to deal with the entire oc veterinary nursing team were super helpful supportive and amazing its been a rough  years but with persistence and help i did it would definitely say give it a crack what have you got to lose
5,18-04-2018,thanks for the support and attention to detail,i have completed my certificate  in education support with open colleges for the last  months i have had support either on the other end of the phone or via email with trainers and accessors i would certainly recommend open colleges to others for their next career change or to expand on the knowledge basei feel very confident with open colleges and know that if i referred someone they too would be happy with this study option
4,18-04-2018,i had no major problems,i had no major problems help was available at all times though i do feel some of the modules may need updating and also the instructions in the portfolio for submitting wasn't what you actually had to do so maybe that needs reviewing i have no real complaints though i will see how the next two years go
2,18-04-2018,would not recommend,would not recommendmy experience with oc was to say the least mentally exhaustingit's a  year course which took me  years and an extra  because of the lack of clarification from the start of the level of detail they are aftermost questions they repeat that they want more detail then in one question they say this is a more generalized question dont be so specific  this can be very confusingthe questions are often too broad and not specific enoughfor examplea case study asks to write about an inpatient and discuss nursing care giveni hand  pages in and get told to redo it because it has to be a case hospitalized for  hours or more this would be good to have known before wasting time submittingalthough the assessors are easy to get into contact with generally the feedback and marking time for admissions of portfolios are anywhere between  and  months more assessors or less enrollments would be better
5,17-04-2018,great experience,i had a great experience studying with open colleges the learning material was really engaging the assessments were really clear and relevant to the learning material  stars should be given to ean my trainer he was always available to answer to any questions i had and helped me a lot to fully understand what i was required to do in order to finish my assessments
5,16-04-2018,i found doing my course with open,i found doing my course with open colleges an awesome experience it was explained very well throughout the entire course and if you need help the response was quick and always explained well this give me the flexibility to be at home with my family and study within the time frame that suited me i could stop at any time and pick up where i left off when ever i needed without any worry i would recommend open colleges to everyone and it would definitely be my first choice again if i ever decide to study further  ps thank you for this great opportunity i have definitely enjoyed every minute
4,16-04-2018,overall worth doing,i enjoyed studying with open colleges i found it easy to do while working full time and the allowances for extensions if needed were very helpful as life did get in the way on occassionbeing in perth did make it difficult with the time difference of contacting tutors for help but overall they were very responsivemy only note would be that perhaps not every unit needs an audio assignment i understand that they are important to establish how a student would communicate but some units i found it was pointless and it became difficult to find people willing to participate or a time where that was able to happeni would probably study through open colleges again in the future
5,16-04-2018,excellent learning experience,i have really enjoyed studying with open colleges and have received excellent and useful feedback from my tutor the communications from the college about administrative matters were also very helpful my only suggestion is that the  course in professional editing and proofreading is updated to take into account recent technology changes thanks
3,15-04-2018,would i do it again nope,course material is repetitive and assessment questions are ambiguous  open to interpretation need to read a lot between the lines assessors are helpful and accessible portfolio is a joke and desperately needs to be rejigged i had a lot of trouble uploading photos and videos embedded in portfolio document sent multiple usb's but all the material on the usb's was not uploaded onto their system once received which was extremely frustrating  months to grade st portfolio submission mark time definitely needs to be reduced think oc should cap their enrollments
4,15-04-2018,student support and the trainers,student support and the trainers meg molenaar and david  isaacson have been helpful and considerate
5,13-04-2018,thank you,found everyone ive dealt with helpful feedback has helped growth in my studies very happy to be finished
5,13-04-2018,i found open colleges to be a great way,i found open colleges to be a great way to study online they were very helpful and had great student support
5,12-04-2018,great learning experience,easy to learn experience  the course learning material is well laid out in a logical format and very easy to work throughthe instructions are clear and easy to understandinteraction with the assessors was easy and responses were super quickoverall a great experience
5,11-04-2018,very good experience,very good experience  the material was easy to access and read through the assessments were tough but pinpointed where answers could be found and assessments were always marked within the  business day period as advertised  would definitely use open colleges again for any further study
4,11-04-2018,the open colleges staff and helplines,the open colleges staff and helplines were great however some course material was poorly worded and confusing i would recommend that they review some of the assessments they provide in greater detail
5,11-04-2018,this platform was the only way i could,this platform was the only way i could obtain my diploma so i'm truly grateful for oc's online courseit is not an easy course and it will take a strong commitment but i would and have recommended it to peers and colleaguesi found the assessors to be helpful supportive and provide valuable feedback support centre always did their best to provide excellent service thank you to kelly and the other assessorsclare the head trainer was amazing throughout the entire course and i want to acknowledge her professionalism both as a trainer and as a counsellor her ease of being her non judgemental presence and continuous positivity and support was truly invaluable and i'm deeply grateful to her and her colleagues
2,10-04-2018,bad experience,had difficulty with waiting  days for an assessment to be marked longer if public holidays finding a work placement that would accept open college student getting assessments signed off receiving my certificatestill dont have it
3,10-04-2018,open colleges is not the way to go,open colleges is unprofessional in letting a student start a course knowing that the course wont run for the allotted time i was a transition student who was  percent through my course when i had to start at the beginning with no credits while my assessor was fantastic the system is poor i had no end of trouble with the online submissions and wont be recommending the college if the college knows the course is under review they should not be offering it this cost me a whole years worth of work
3,10-04-2018,the learning material occasionally had,the learning material occasionally had spelling mistakes assignments were written with very unclear instructions and was often hard to understandinterpret from broken english some multiple choice assessments had incorrect answers marked as the correct response technical glitches were also incurred  eg next topics not releasing automatically when the prior one has been completed and the total number of assessments for the course being displayed incorrectly at login the number of inbedded videos in the last half of the course made the pages hard to load and navigate but were very helpful for learning some links are also no longer valid so require updatingwhat worked well was the online 'drag and drop' function to submit assessments and the ability to resubmit assessments with recommendations for improvement before final marks were submitted if the requirements had been misunderstood student support were also very responsive and helpful over the phone
1,09-04-2018,if i could rate lower i probably would,if i could rate lower i probably would i have poured quite a lot of money into my course and once paid open colleges doesnt care if you pass or fail i have tried to gain work experience through many places and i am being met with laughter and industry professionals saying to me that they never accept open colleges applicants because its not a highly regarded form of study and that our certificates mean nothing and if they had an applicant with an open colleges certificate they would put it at the bottom of the pile when signing up to my course i was not told how hard it is to get work placement and that there would be support the whole way throughreally disappointed that i have spent so much money and put myself into difficult financial situations so i could study and get my dream job only to be faced with the hard truth that what i have been doing wasnt even worth it
5,09-04-2018,well written and easy to understand,well written and easy to understand assessments and youre able to get in contact with trainers easily and get a helpful response in an efficient time frame would recommend to anyone whos interested in studying online
5,08-04-2018,an excellent way to study,i recently completed a certificate iv ageing support through open colleges after being away from formal study for many yearsi found them to be very helpful and supportive and the course was well prepared and very thorough as a result i easily gained an excellent job as an assistant nurse in an aged care facilityit is highly likely that i will undertake further study with open colleges at a later date
4,07-04-2018,good luck,easy to access reading materialsinformation relevant to my jobi am glad i chose open colleges to do my course through
4,07-04-2018,open colleges,open colleges  cert  in health care assistancei had a great experience with this course at times it can be hard to stay motivated without the face to face contact offered in a uni or tafe settingi also struggled at times when there was a delay in marking or opening modules as you get on a role and just want to keep going but need to waiti would recommend to others wanting to trainthanks
4,07-04-2018,would recommend,i found everyone to be really helpful some response and marking times were fairly slow but thoroughly enjoyed the course nonetheless
3,07-04-2018,open college review,i enjoyed the content of my course and thought it was all great learning experiences my only problem was trying to upload assessments or videos into open space especially with the workplace portfolio the content was always to big and there was always such a hassle with it being too big the other alternatives worked sometimes although had so many troubles and was in the phone to student support a lot
4,06-04-2018,guns and roses  patience,great staff always friendly and willing to support you x
5,06-04-2018,easy and very supportive,easy and very supportive no issues at all through out my course especially when i chose to add an extra  months
4,06-04-2018,great contentbut online learning a challenge,for the most part i enjoyed my certificate i had a lot of personal issues along the way so it took me three years to complete but all staff were excellent i think i felt let down a little with the the study buddy system and communication amongst peers until i turned to facebook another issue i had was during the whole transition periodmay need to be looked ati found the online learning a lot more challenging than i had anticipated  but i loved the content and the interior design subjects thanks for the experience
4,06-04-2018,overall the course was good,overall the course was goodalthough there was a few things that could be improvedthe student support team once contacted were helpfully and extremely motivating although even when booking in a team to be called there was multiple about  times where i never received a call without an explanation was called or emailed saying my appointment had been cancelled with no help of rescheduling which on most occasions meant another week of waiting and then one time i was phoned and emailed to have my appointment cancelled and then called to say it was not cancelled  other times people were suppose to call for additional learning support blocks and were never calledsecondly the assignments are extremely repetitive although easy i think it would be better to extend rather then slightly change them this on occasions made it extremely unclear as i was basically repeating what i had done in a prior assignment sometimes in a different format or rather then an essay it was an audioi enjoyed doing the course business administration is usually a starter course so by all means it can be pretty boring anywaytrainers were super helpful although sometimes taking a few days to reply make it easier to get unmotivated to continue on
5,06-04-2018,an experience,challenging  experience when studying on your own  support is there if needed but still a challenge
4,05-04-2018,i am very happy being enrolled with,i am very happy being enrolled with open colleges as they always give assistance to their learners quick response to inquiries and always ensure that the learners get the help they needed in studying in terms of notes they give loads of information to the learners which is very useful for the study and to the future job you will into the other thing that bit disappointing is the audio response which  i think not really necessary but overall i got a satisfaction in completing the courseall the best
1,03-04-2018,nothing but trouble,had trouble after trouble unbelievably the lack of support given and the amount of time it takes to get stuff done even with constant phone calls and follow up emails the matter is still not resolved would not recommend

5,31-03-2018,trainers were excellent,trainers were excellent  always available to help and assignments  were assessed promptly their feedback was extensive and very useful
3,31-03-2018,overall,overall the course was satisfactory however i did find it difficult when trying to get questions answered in an acceptable length of timealso sometimes the information provided in the reading matter was difficult to follow as the grammar was not quite righti found that doing a course online is not really for me and cant replace that one on one contact with your tutor
5,30-03-2018,my experience with open colleges was,my experience with open colleges was nothing but positive i consistently had fantastic support from the student services team who answered any questions i had along the way the trainers were all very easy to contact and very helpful in any assessment related questions i had i would definitely recommend open colleges if you're looking to upskill
3,30-03-2018,course was ok,course was ok lots of information was outdated information units contained grammar and punctuation errors assessment questions were hard to understand portfolio took way way too long to mark assessors are generally pretty good at getting back to you with help if requested
5,30-03-2018,i have successfully completed my,i have successfully completed my diploma of youth work through open colleges the course was very straight forward and easy to follow the work is selfpaced which i enjoyed as it fit in to my fulltime work schedule would recommend open colleges to anyone who's working full time and still wants to continue their professional development
4,30-03-2018,self discipline reaps good results,my overall experience as a student of open colleges was very positive all assessments were marked in a timely manner and questions answered well what i would say though is that online study whatever the institute you decide to do it through requires a good degree of self discipline dedication and patience there is no one to bounce off no immediate question and answer response if you want answers you need to be prepared to do your own research and think beyond what is in front of you as is the case with any study path ultimately the end result is a reflection of the personal effort a person has put in
1,29-03-2018,find a different provider,poorly structured releases electives first which were later no longer relevant to course under new legislation so wasted time core modules should be first outdated examples that dont apply to the average finance role work material was flawed and based on feedback has been flawed for years and not fixed errors in quiz questions no accountability taken by open college assesors are contracted so can only advise on the assessment course work is by a rd party providers so open college say they dont have controll of it incorrect information provided by student supportbasically stay well clear of the bookkeeping and accouting courses i have not spoken to one student that had a positive experience
5,29-03-2018,i found the course very easy to follow,i found the course very easy to follow any question i had the lecture was more than happy to help me and advise me where and what to do
5,28-03-2018,course for bas agent skill set is an,course for bas agent skill set is an excellent course with clear and concise information and requirementsqueries answered promptly my assessor was brilliant she marked and answered my questions super fast assessment feedback was very clear and detailed
3,28-03-2018,a quicker turn around on email and grading would be  again,for me it was easy to study with  children at school and to run a property hence i paid more to get the time and the support unlike a tafe course  i was not impressed that the course changed after a year of being on it and after getting  hds i was only given one credit for my first aid course which i paid for by myself not included in the course fees and now i found out that they knew the course was changing but told noone and new people joined up  that was not fair the next year was good the support was good  assessors lovely  now it takes a week just to open an email just to tell you they will do asap your task then takes assessors  working days to mark and review the staff cuts have been too much so now the support is good but very slow which if you only have  days around a job and children to work with sometimes i do not get an answer for  weeks  what a waste of time when it is so precious  personally i am  whereas a year ago i was  in favour

3,26-03-2018,online learning is a great tool but problematic,online learning is a great tool  it is flexible easy to navigate and learnopen college's support team and training staff are friendly and knowledgeablehowever the lack of face to face tutorials with real world lecturers is problematic  online learning shouldn't mean disconnection  tutorials could be done once a month via webinars  also when assessments are poorly worded and lack synchronization in questioning  inaccuracies in student output and disruption to the students ability to understand the module of information occurs

2,23-03-2018,i would not recommend open colleges,poorly structured course with assignments that provided little information and context i now have a job in a law firm as an assistant which is what the course is aimed at however i very rarely do anything that is outlined in the coursealso incredibly expensive for what it was i definitely feel it wasnt worth the cost
4,23-03-2018,very happy with the course and the,very happy with the course and the support i recived
5,22-03-2018,rewarding,i found learning through open colleges to be rewarding using the online resources and submitting assignments was easy studying is a challenge but open colleges always provided me with support and guided me through the process for busy people who find it hard to get to a face to face class i would highly recommend it
4,22-03-2018,easy to use and great for your own time,i have found it very easy to navigate get great support and a manageable workload great to fit into my busy life because i can do it when it suits me the only thing i have a worry about is it can be quite hard to find placement otherwise i would recommend
2,22-03-2018,the material is out dated,the material is out dated not enough there and the lay out of the assessments is very poor there was no help at all i never new who to contact as when i was doing my portfolio by assessor changed  times and i was sent the wrong feedback messaged one of the assessors  times and never go reply the assessments weren't all appropriate to the work placements either they really need to work on consistency and communication i have told anyone looking to study with open colleges not to
1,22-03-2018,avoid,avoid after signing up i told they're getting rid of their experienced contract trainers replacing them with only one trainer per course save money so getting only one inhouse person's feedback instead of  experienced people when i ask about it i was told that trainer from a similar course would be marking couple my assessments this bad and deceptive and not college i signedup for my course and money i want multiple people giving me guidance and feedback for different subjects like proper college
5,21-03-2018,very good help from all the support,very good help from all the support people involved
5,21-03-2018,myob,great course material was excellent
5,21-03-2018,great study option,great study option flexible and trainers are always helpful and assessments are challenging but reasonable
3,20-03-2018,coursework good but system problems overall,the coursework looked interesting and well put together but i was given credits through credit transfer and rpls so that i didn't need to do much i had quite a bit of trouble with the systems and departments not contacting or updating each other so that i couldn't access materials openspace didn't update to reflect my rpls a system error with accounting no responses from trainers or regarding emails etc i've only been enrolled for a month and a half there shouldn't be this many problems in this short period of time
4,20-03-2018,positive experience,it is wonderful to be able to study online as a stay home mum at any time very supportive trainers  accessors each time i had questions my experience with open colleges was a positive one
3,20-03-2018,i would have felt more support if the,i would have felt more support if the trainers where more available to answer questions especially after hours and on weekends thats when majority of students can study having to wait  sometimes  days  to hear back from a trainer is very stressful and inconvenient having a forum with  faq for each module would have been so important and helpful  it was very frustrating when the trainers requested students to inbox them directly as i had the same questions too  but had to wait for a private replyoverall a good experience  if the above improved then i would consider completing another certificate
3,19-03-2018,questions and requirements were often,questions and requirements were often ambiguous due to poor wording or bad grammar
2,19-03-2018,unprofessional and unorganised  wouldn't recommend,i was very disappointed with open collegesthe running of the course was not organised i received marks of other students by mistake which was completely unprofessionalthe delivery of the course was oldfashioned why provide us with worksheets to learn from when we live in the modern age where we can engage in more interesting means like videos or powerpointsi've got to be honest the knowledge i gained from this course was small i probably could have educated myself quicker with a google searchthe certificate itself business administration was worth my time but i would not recommend completing it through open colleges
5,18-03-2018,a great experience,open colleges made studying online much easier by always being available to answer questions  even on weekends the assessors were also very responsive and helpful through the message centre i was given enough course materials to understand the units and produce appropriate assignments
5,17-03-2018,great course and great experience,thank you and it has been a great experiencethe assessor kim is very kind and efficient thank you
5,17-03-2018,excellent guidance,i chose open colleges because online study was the best option for me and the fee charged was the lowest compared to the other institutions the course turned out to be easier than i had expected the study material is detailed and understandable most of all my assessor was always encouraging and quick to respond when ever i had a question
2,15-03-2018,firstly i started my course and within,firstly i started my course and within months i was told the course was changing so i had to start all over again with no credits why didnt they warn me when signing up next for the second course i was only given months to complete until i rang up and this was changed the time i could receive support was when i made an appointment for in advance so if it didnt fall on a day my daughter was at daycare i couldnt do it as was too hard having her home every time i rang student support they couldnt help me the only time they were useful was when they wanted to take my money the only time i heard from student support was receiving my marks for assignments and if i needed to make a payment open colleges was good for being able to do it at your own pace whenever you wanted but very difficult if you dont have flexibility such as having young children
3,14-03-2018,leadership and management,overall the diploma has been a wonderful experience for me the hassle was doing the video content to find english speakers i had to use the same people all the time and it was difficult to co ordinate times to make those tasks complete other than the video i will give much appreciation to the assessors who always do a wonderful job in marking my assessments thank you for the teachingssincerelychris
5,14-03-2018,helping hands,help on hand at all times fantastic group
4,13-03-2018,convenient way to study,i found the course material very extensive and easy to understand the trainers were always very quick to respond to messages and do the marking there were some errors in the course material which caused some confusion at times but that was only minor and a quick message to the trainer solved the problem i would recommend open colleges
3,13-03-2018,overall a good experience but the program needs improvements,goodpretty good phone servicegood structurelayout of contentcontent was clear and easy to learn from with pics videos webistes textbook etcassessments were clear and so was feedbacksome assessments incl practical assessments were flexible to a degree which is important when the workplace has limited facilitiesanimalspoorpractical element was advertised to me as 'you only have to do  hours volunteer work in a captive facility' they failed to mention that a no zoos in my area would take volunteersstudents and i would have to travel interstate b that there was a logbook and giant portfolio to fill out which required you to do things that were very difficult to do in some workplaces take videos get signed off on specific tasks that they don't allow volunteers to do for insurance purposes etc open colleges needs to be forward in having a list of workplaces that guarantee work for students and informing students before they begin the course about this list so they are aware of any travel they might have to doalso for an 'online course' they need a better way of displaying learning materials that don't take so long to load a  page pdf with videos and pictures cannot be displayed on a single webpage even with the fastest internet and computer it's slow to load in addition assessments require you to upload  minute videos but the maximum upload size is mb i had so much trouble uploading things that were even mb this is not user friendly for a course that is supposed to be all onlinemodules need to open up as soon as you submit your assessment for the previous module why should we have to wait  days for assessors to mark italso why  business days to mark assignments i understand that amount of time for portfolios but one of my quizzes took  business days to mark and my portfolio well over  weeks the course is supposed to run over a year  weeks to mark something is not great it should be no more than  business days to mark normal assessments and  for large assessments
5,12-03-2018,a fantastic experience,studying with open colleges has been a lifesaveri've suffered from anxiety my whole life and it severely affected the way i learnt at a normal public school i dropped out of year  as my grades couldn't be saved and my anxiety worsenedthankful open colleges was able to let me study at home at my own pace and made me care about my grades there were some great assignments that i did but unfortunately my final assignment was the worst one through help from friends and family i was able to complete it which was a relief and made me appreciate the hard work i had accomplished over the  months i had been doing the coursei will  be coming back to study at open colleges rather than worrying about which tafe or university i should try to get into the stress of no exams was fantastic and doing a little bit of my course each day rather than hours on end made the experience worthwhile
2,12-03-2018,just not good enough,just not good enough  caused great deal of stress and ill healthextremely poor course material  if i had not been working as a bookkeeperaccounts clerk i would never have been able to make any sense of the courseno academic support  not told why you were marked incorrect questions never answeredextremely poor communications  if i had not made contact i would still be waiting for my certificate to arriveand it never would because they didn't inform me that they had no record of my submitting something
5,11-03-2018,excellent course,excellent course service was excellent by tracey very professional
4,11-03-2018,my education journey,i found the level of education provided to a high standard with a decent degree of difficulty which enable me to learn new skills both through the curriculum and through the method by which we are required to summit assessments and gain confidence in the usage of software which i wouldn't have used in normal day life
5,11-03-2018,open collage are very  supporting,open collage are very  supporting great trainer's and friendly  service
4,11-03-2018,i got a lot out of it,i got a lot out of itit was the right thing for me

5,11-03-2018,highly recommend,open colleges offers great support and thorough learning material which is serving me and has prepared me immensely in the field of support education
5,10-03-2018,thank you,thank you i'm dyslexic so it was hard for me at times but the trainers and assessors where very very helpful i did have moment's were i felt like i couldn't do it cause i didn't understand some of the questions or my grade got withheld but i enjoyed learning with open collages and would recommend it to anyone who wants to do online studiesthank you againelke xo
1,09-03-2018,i found my course very frustrating and,i found my course very frustrating and degrading that every assessment had to be done at least two to three times before it was marked satisfactory  i am still waiting two months and  about   to  emails later after completing my course  to receive my certificate  it has all been one problem after another  i would never recommend doing study through open college
5,09-03-2018,i would highly recommend open colleges,i would highly recommend open colleges i found them to be very helpful to me in my study and the payment plan was a very helpful way for me to pay for my course
4,08-03-2018,highly recommend to those who need,highly recommend to those who need flexibility with their studies
5,08-03-2018,was great,was great had help when i needed it and lots of information to help me completed
1,08-03-2018,dont waste your time and money,i did a great deal of your fashion diploma  it was awful and the materials were very unprofessional just links often broken to youtube videos and personal blogs or broad shallow uninformative blurbs that didnt help complete assessments i contacted them for help and they said they would follow me up  then didnt on several occasions the wrong trainers were sometimes listed so i didnt get answers to my questions for ages dont do this course if you think you will learn sewing skills  you wont despite what i was told on the phone which is hilarious because you need fairly advanced sewing skills to complete and pass assignments though i was told when i signed up it was suitable for beginner sewers not true you will barely get instruction in pattern making just go buy a pattern making book  thats all the information you get anyway this course is a joke and a total waste of money wish i could get my money back because no value aside from the few textbooks sent to me was provided you will literally learn just as much for free by googling reading sewing blogs and watching youtube videos do not use open colleges
4,07-03-2018,i found my experience with open colleges great,i found my experience with open colleges fantastic the course work and module were set out well and very informative and i found the assessments covered everything staff were all helpful and returned my emails or answered my questions quickly  the only negative i have is the trouble i had finding work placement  i am in hobart tasmania and most facilities have affiliations with particular learning facilities  it took me  months to find work placement  i did have help from one of the support officers roberto who was fantastic
3,07-03-2018,i have just completed my certificate iv veterinary nursing,i have just completed my certificate iv in veterinary nursingwould i recommend open colleges  probably noti had no problem with access online contacting assessors and the material that was included in my studies being an online course obviously its needed to go more in depth with assessments since the student  assessor never actually meet so the content although daunting at times i think is fairthe biggest let down for my course in particular is the wait time for marking the portfolio the final piece of assessmentits one of the most crucial and time consuming parts of the course and to have to wait  months for it to be assessed i think was ridiculous obviously oc are either short staffed or accepting too many students and the workload is too much for the oc staffi have nothing but lovely words to say about my assessor when my portfolio was finally marked she contacted me to say it was next in line reviewed it within the time line she said she would and my resubmit was marked very quickly so no problems there i was very grateful to receive emails from her outside normal working hoursbut  months i think is absolutely ridiculous to wait for a piece of assessment to be marked it put a huge stress and frustration on the course and this needs to be reviewedi wouldnt recommend oc because of this as it seems putting on as many students as possible is more important than actually having the resources to successfully help students with their courseagain i dont have a bad word to say about the assessors in the vet nursing team they were great i think the problem lies with whoever makes the decision to take on so many students that the assessors cant keep up with the workload this i believe is a common comment for this course in particular
4,07-03-2018,great service,besides a couple technical difficulties it is one of the best online or offline studying options  so far
5,07-03-2018,motivating trainers,the comments the trainers made on my feedback form was always positive and motivating my workplace trainer was excellent she always responded immediately to my emails and was very flexible with phone calls the information and video links were excellent as they helped to add a practical side to the course
2,06-03-2018,an unorganized college that i had,an unorganized college that i had problems with from the very start to the very end the educators and assessors were lovely however as a whole the college is very unprofessional and time management poor
2,06-03-2018,badly designed course with poor content,so much irrelevant content and not a genuine representative for learning about the daily work life in bookkeeping assessments are poorly written and require a lot of clarification unbelievably most od the assessments are in word format everything should be completed in excel and myob this should be  numbers work many current students complain on the forums about how bad this course is amd we are forced to rely on each other for help if we want a timely response very disappointed in this course and would not recommend
5,05-03-2018,fiona saunders is an amazing teacher i,fiona saunders is an amazing teacher i leant lits and had fun as well the modules were written ok but there were a lot of typos connecting to information links were sometimes difficult but all in all it was great fun
5,05-03-2018,excellence in online learning,i just completed the bas agent registration skill set course what can i say i am very impressed with the quality and completeness of the course material provided the tutors are absolutely fantastic prompt in their responses and very helpful the course is hard work there is no doubt about it but if you really want to learn you are very much on the right track completing this course will give you knowledge and skills you may have not had beforei have been so impressed with the course that i have just enrolled in another course to continue increasing my knowledge just loved ita big thank you at everybody at open colleges
1,05-03-2018,they took my money even after illnesses and charged 'late fees',they never answer you they take your money they dont contact you they also charge late fees for no reasons i made the same payment on the same day for  months went to ring them to make final payment and apparently have a late fee for starters why is only this  payment late they will take your money dont care if you are terminally ill they just want your money would not reccommend
1,05-03-2018,they will take your money and ignore you,they advertise support and intensive informationthe whole course is just a series of pdf's that you read and its asks you to review the content at the bottom with a multiple choice questionthey say they offer support but the trainers take often  to reply to any questions you have and when you give them direct feedback they start ignoring you and speak to you aggressively also and most offensively when you do require support and ask for it not only do they take there time replying but when they reply the often send you to another website and recommend reading material outside of their own website instead on communicating actual supportive never felt so unsupported by anything i feel literally robbeddo not give them your money
3,04-03-2018,i studied with open colleges for a,i studied with open colleges for a while and my experience was good every time i had to make contact with the student support team they were always very helpful and accommodating and would always find a solution the most challenging thing about studying was the communication between the teacher and the student as this was never a quick process as i am busy working and travelling for work when i get to study it was late a night or on the weekends and if i ever had a question it would usually take multiple days to reply which means your assessment piece is on hold for those days which can cause frustration due to the time allocation i did find at some points when i asked questions about the assessment i wouldn't get much back which would mean i needed to clarify my question and wait another few days for the answer don't get me wrong i had great teachers who are obviously really busy with many students what i would recommend is having a chat function on your site for teachers and students to communicate if they have a question about the assessment piece for a quick response the only other issues i had throughout my studies were login issues which caused me not to be able to get in for a week with little communication all in all it was a good experience i am waiting for my diploma in the mail but the site hasn't updated for me to reflect  so there is another tech issue thank you for the experience
5,04-03-2018,support where its needed,from start to finish i have had support from open colleges trainers and assessors being a full time employee and mum to a beautiful family i struggled at times to stay awake some nights as i study but the resources we had including the learner guide made things easy to follow and understand any questions i had regarding assessments where to find thingsor just getting reassurance they were answered in a timely manner any technical support i required student support were right therei had a lovely experience i even got a friend to join the study bandwagon
1,04-03-2018,i would not recommend open colleges to,i would not recommend open colleges to friends or family as the tutorsassessors do not provide help when requested it seemed it was easier for them to advise just google it when a topic wasnt understood during the assessmentthe course was a cert  in bookkeeping however it feels more like an english exam as the assessments are written in a manner that is confusing and unnecessarily hard to understanddont waste your time or money
5,04-03-2018,the support staff are wonderful,the support staff are wonderful they answer emails and phone calls very promptly very helpful and put you at ease when you may be a little stressed the course was very well organised with a lot of extra resources
1,04-03-2018,the only assessor that helped me,the only assessor that helped me responded efficiently and gave me the correct information was lyndal wilkinson multiple occasions i was given the wrong information about my course student support never responded efficiently my emails would either get ignored or i would get a response weeks lateri will not be recommending open colleges to anyone even the course information was incorrect on open spacevery unprofessional inefficient and unorganised
4,03-03-2018,open collages review,great support and a paced way of learning
5,02-03-2018,materials and valuable feedback from,materials and valuable feedback from tutor is such that i feel happy and great with the new knowledge i acquired from open colleges what can one ask for when learning from a great learning college or university i for one can recommend open colleges to anyone on the street friends and family
5,01-03-2018,easy to navigate and helpful,i found the entire online studying with open colleges to be easy to navigate and when i had issues all the staff on the end of the phone easily fixed all the issues i had whether it was about course payments or uploading assessments i loved my course and can't wait for the next opportunity to learn more about my chosen field thanks jo
5,01-03-2018,helpful and fast,open colleges has been very good i am working to a deadline set by my boss and all the trainers and assessors have been good at providing quick support and feedback which had helped me get to the deadline thanks open colleges
4,28-02-2018,cert  in health services,i found the cert  in health services assistance overall a very broad education however as a mature  yo adult i found some of the personal development stuff a little over the top it would be good guidance for a young person though also i think the work placement would be quite difficult for some people to organise i was very lucky to have known someone in a public hospital who was able to give me everything i neededi received great support from my assessor eve who pushed me through when i was stuck  encouraged me throughout
5,28-02-2018,a lot of people told me not to study,a lot of people told me not to study with open colleges but in the  months it took for me to complete my certificate i had zero complaintsopen colleges are very easy to contact and communicate with if you need help with somethingthey helped me especially with my placement which was really good
5,28-02-2018,training was excellent,training was excellent if any problems the staff listened and acted appropriately to find resolutions enjoyable and excellent experience
3,27-02-2018,mostly fine with a few hiccups,mostly fine with a few hiccups admin support was good responses to my queries were for the most part prompt the course content and assessments were interesting and the work placement was valuable and flexible enough for me to pursue my own areas of interest my experience of the course was also impacted by the trainers
2,27-02-2018,i felt that there was definitely not enough support,i felt that there was definitely not enough support from the college when i asked questions i would get very vague short answers i don't feel like they ever made an effort to help people 'read the supporting documents' was a popular replyshortly after i first started the course i received communication advising that they had changed the course and practically had to start again from scratch it was so poorly handled and i know it put a lot of people off continuing recently i email asking to get confirmation of what assessments i still needed to complete as it is not easy to tell from your login i received a reply stating there were  left for me to complete which i soon had finished only to speak to someone at the college less than a week later to say no you are not finished you still have two assessments to go as a result of the change to the course when i first started not happy if you like the approach of having someone on hand to guide and help you through a course than i would look elsewhere as you will not get it there
4,26-02-2018,open colleges was a good fit for me as,open colleges was a good fit for me as i work as a causal and had another part time job when i started it meant that i could study when i was free to do so and work when i was needed rather than having to say 'no i have my course today' and miss out on a day's work as a result it was a little slow in terms of all the papperwork be processed but overall it was worth iti'll be pleased when i finally receive my certificate iii in individualised support disability
5,26-02-2018,a for student support,my main commendation goes to student support they were fast to respond to emails were extremely helpful and so nice over he telephone and really give a stuff if you succeed or notthe trainers accessors and teachers are helpful but you can sometimes feel like a nuiscense when you contact themhands down a great college to learn through and i will be to further my learning
3,25-02-2018,once underway with study everything is,once underway with study everything is very straight forward and the teachers are great at getting back to you via email with any questions you havehow ever student support is another matter and iv been enrolled then un in rolled iv been put on the wrong course and varies other annoying issuesonce you manage to actually get on your course the rest is fine
3,26-02-2018,overall i enjoyed my diploma however,overall i enjoyed completing my diploma with open colleges however there is definitely room for improvement i found especially in the last couple of modules that the learning material was not sufficient enough to complete the assignments also the links in the materials are now quite dated i found viewing you tube clips for marketing from the mids were missing information relevant for today's marketing the open college portal was also quite temperamental and would often crash my tracking dashboard was always incorrect as it tracks against all  modules it seems and not the  which we are required to complete
2,25-02-2018,would not recommend don't get tricked in to it,if you inquire about this qualification  they will persistently convince you to sign up to a fortnightly debit for  months  they'll offer you a deal if you sign up immediately it's just a marketing ploy it is really not worth the money also consider having that amount of money direct debited  if you're on centrelink support or have low income absolutely avoid this it doesn't sound like much but on a week when you're struggling it really is there is no way of opting out of the repayments once you have started unless you have crisis circumstancesassessors rarely respond to student comments or questions and it is clear in the assessment structure and questions that little care has been taken to ask relevant questions this certificate will not qualify you to work effectively with or understand young people  but having a certificate on your resume may give you the confidence you need to apply for jobs if you're brand new to youth work it'll give you a basic understanding of everything you need to know safety ethics etc  but if you already work in the sector i would really not recommend instead seek professional development opportunities if you have just left high school or youre returning to study  this is not the place for you it is not supportive and poorly put together a very small percentage of people finish go to a tafe in person  or volunteer at your local ymca and they will train you as you go
5,25-02-2018,this company is amazing,this company is amazing extremely helpful and they go above and beyond thank you open colleges
3,24-02-2018,i think that,i think thatsome of the open colleges' staff are not responsible enoughthe materials are not organized well some of the questions have been just copied and pasted from the paid educational websites eg aboriginal
5,23-02-2018,i really loved the experience,i really loved the experience the support and the resources i've learned a lot and would recommend to others
5,23-02-2018,i have had the best experience this,i have had the best experience this past year i wasn't sure or confident in returning to study after not having done any for years but all those nerves subsided when i began to get into a routine a personally tailored routine set out for me by the wonderful staff at open college that helped encourage and support me  i was able to get the help along the way that was needed made a few friends though the study buddy process which will be keeping in touch with and learned to love getting back to the books all over againthe practical side was amazing and made it clear to myself that this wasis the right industry that i have chosen  i am now working for the place that i did my workplacement for and loving every shift i do therethe staffassessors continued to help me when sometimes i found it hard and everything just seemed to fall into line  i will miss the atmosphere of openspace where it was nice to go and catch up with others doing the same course as me a place where i felt i belonged and was acceptedsupported  i will be going through open learning again in the future for study and have already encouraged a few friends to give it a go aswell  thank you open college for making this entire process not only an informative one but also and enojoyable onei did it
1,23-02-2018,i would never study through open,i would never study through open colleges again i only had my practical hours left to do when they updated their course made me start from scratch again and would not provide an extension i found i was often answering the same questions multiple time for different assessments and when help was required the feedback given was poor i also found the requirements for work placement quite repetitive the material provided was often poor and filled with grammatical errors and resources we were unable to open
4,23-02-2018,the learning materials  online,the learning materials  online learning were great also my assessor  workplace assessor were fantastic i did request further information moving on from my cert iii in fitness to continue with a cert iv but i received no response overall a great course
3,23-02-2018,i had a good experience with exception,i had a good experience with exception from my main trainer  the customer service team and other trainers in particular boris were outstanding but i felt that the trainer assigned to me matthew burns was in opposition to me in a few areas in particular my te gym and tieing up the loose ends to have me certified to move onto my cert  studies  based on this experience i wouldn't recommend or revisit open colleges in the future
2,23-02-2018,diploma of early childhood education and care,when i signed up for the course i was told that as long as i had completed year  and could write a business letter then i would easily be able to complete the course this could not have been further from the truth i found the course exhausting stressful and the assessors for the most part very unhelpful i would ask them questions and for the most part would get absolutely no reply the written material provided for each module was often quite poorly written and i needed to do a lot of extra research to get a true understanding of certain topics there was a couple of trainers that were absolute superstars but i unfortunately only came in contact with them as i was ending the course many of my now colleagues that have worked in the childcare industry for years some of whom have completed their bachelor were truly shocked by the volume and complexity of the work i had to get through during my work placement it was truly staggering  which ended up taking far longer then i had thought it would as a result with the greatest respect to open colleges i would not recommend this particular course  i would highly recommend if you've never worked in the childcare industry before that you do your diploma on the job through another provider as i know for a fact that the workload will not be nearly as heavy
5,23-02-2018,review,i completed the certificate in professional editing and proofreading and would have no hesitation in recommending open colleges to anyone looking to complete this course
3,23-02-2018,a little disappointing,as my first foray into studying since leaving school in the late 's open colleges seemed a reasonable way to obtain a certificate in my chosen field as i wished to study online at my own pace i found some of the course material lacking in substance and definitely lacking in grammatical correctness and i found i needed to do a lot of additional research to flesh out the subjects if you wish to be spoonfed uptodate and comprehensive written material  resources structured regular webinars  tutorials and realtime feedback  help then i suggest shopping around this may not be the option for you
5,22-02-2018,excellent support from admin trainers assessors,excellent support from admin trainers and assessors the trainers and assessprs put up with a lot of crap on the online forum and they always respond appropriately and continue helping the students
3,22-02-2018,i found the course work to be quite,i found the course work to be quite intensebut also quite in depth i was not happy with the process for finding work placementand there was too much work to do as well as learn the practical side of the job it became stressful and we really had no support from the college
5,22-02-2018,would recommend,completing my course in youth work has even very straight forward and easy to progress through the site is set out in a very user friendly way and the contents are organised efficiently i feel i did not waste any time reading unnecessary information and all the information was useful in completing the assessments and quizzesthe trainers and assessors were very helpful in getting every assessment over the line and provided great feedback in a timely mannerit was easy to manage time as it was easy to foresee exactly what needed to be done in each modulei would  do another course with opencolleges for further qualification without hesitationthe site was also functional across all devices which made getting through the material so easy
5,21-02-2018,great experience,great experience the material was sufficient easy to understand and exercises of all range to gather experience the help from the assessors was prompt and the feedback was detailed if there was one thing i'd like to add was the assessments to be marked and sent back to the students in order for them to see all the details
4,21-02-2018,review,enjoyed study with open colleges they were helpfull with any questions i had  responded in a reasonable time
5,20-02-2018,diploma of accounting great experience,i was very happy with  the open colleges service whilst completing my diploma of accounting course material was clear support from staff was great and the flexibility to complete subjects at your own pace is very convenient
4,20-02-2018,building and construction diploma review,being able to get credit for prior learning was great the course info was very helpful but needed to be more thorough the assessments had a lot of grey areas where more than  answer could have been produced but the assessors seemed to only accept the answer they wanted which didn't seem to be how it would happen in the real world all in all i was quite happy with the course provided and have recommended it to a friend
4,20-02-2018,open colleges review diploma in community service,i would recommend open colleges for on line courses all staff have been friendly and obliging with my queries the only disappointment i have is sometimes not hearing from assessors for a couple of days i did learn to be persistent with seeking answers the price of the course was better than other comparable valued institutions i liked the format of the open space web access easy to navigate around i liked the flexibility of doing the course at my pace
4,20-02-2018,overall good but i was frustrated by,overall good but i was frustrated by the fact you could never talk to somebody on the spot to get answers i had so many queries about arranging work placement the people on the phone could never answer my enquiries very stressful at the time
5,19-02-2018,good course,got a bit stuck in certain areas of confusion with complex rules of grammar and editing the teacher was very good in explaining it to me at a level i could understand to allow to complete my goals in finishing the course and with good grades
5,19-02-2018,due to a great deal of family sadness i,due to a great deal of family sadness i couldn't finish my course in the allotted time the staff at open colleges were so understanding and gave me the time i needed  i would recommend open college to anyone thank you everyone
4,19-02-2018,good contacts with the college,good contacts with the college very helpful and communicate well
2,18-02-2018,unpleasant experience,it was quite an unpleasant experience for me as a first time student and being online it wasnt made clear to me in the beginning that the course would change and i would need to start again after already completing modules and then after finishing all modules it took  more months to find placement i will say that open colleges  roberto and paolo were very quick to respond once i had gone through the long process of sending in what felt like another long essay to prove that i had looked for placement this process was very long and stressful and i believe needs looking into even a list of places that do take online students for us to look upthere needs to be more assessors out in the flield  for the whole of australia seems to be lacking and also more fulltime trainers to be available for help throughout the coursethankfully my workplacement was wonderful experience with loads of help and actually tafe trainers on staff although workplacement should have been about more hands on work practice i also found   hours of working and then going home for another few hours a day to do assessments far too much the supervisor and your workplace buddy are all trained experts in the field and should be able just to sign you off on the tasks necessary people who have to travel away from home and with families would find it all very overwhelmingi would love to do more study but will not undertake another course with open colleges and would not recommend them for study
1,17-02-2018,i will not be recommending open colleges to anyone,i can only speak for the course i did but i will not be recommending open colleges to anyone in fact i will be actively telling people to stay way dont waist your time and moneymany times the readings did not cover the assessment questions some of the answers and readings relating to the assignment question were often not available until the next module so only once i passed a module would i be able to see the relevant contenti found some of the staff very patronising at times and would have to wait weeks for something to get done on their end one question i asked about an assignment was answered months later on the forumthe work placement component of the course was heavily reliant on the student being taught by the workplace taking them on for placement  considering this i found it shocking to know that my boss was never asked about her qualifications or any details about her business luckily she has been teaching for many years and was a very supportive mentoronce i had finally completed all the assignments and had been congratulated for finishing i contacted student support to ask what i needed to do now  i was told that they could see i have completed all the required assignments and that i was done  weeks went by and the very week my course was expiring i was contacted saying they had updated an assignment and i would need to redo it before i can graduate i had completed that assignment  months ago and it was updated  months later i found this completely unreasonable unprofessional and immensely frustratingoverall i feel the knowledge i have gained from this course is less than adequate it was a very disappointing and frustrating experience
2,17-02-2018,regretful course,the actual content was good learnt a fair bit but would love to learn more about the law and policies more in depth but the service and getting help was horrible waited days and even then the reply most likely was not even helpful felt like there was no communication or community no since of help or guideness would never do an online course again
5,17-02-2018,open colleges was the best choice for,open colleges was the best choice for me  i did the course in my own time however if i hadn't submitted an assessment for a while i would receive a polite email with a polite hellowe haven't heard from you fir a while  that was enough to get me going again  my assessor is fantastic and the course material was relevant and set out very well  a big thank you to open colleges
5,17-02-2018,excellent,course was very well written and any questions i had were answered by my trainers promptly i recieved my marks quickly and they were willing to grant me extensions when i wasnt able to study
4,17-02-2018,i had a great experience with open,i had a great experience with open collegessome assessments could of been better written amd clearer
3,17-02-2018,some frustrations delayed the progress,i found a few instances or incorrectly or inaccurate updates of web material including some errors in the examples provided some of the assessments were a little unclear and i had to submit assignments more then once on a couple of occasions because i had not done what was expected i accept that some of this may have been my fault but i believe that at times the instructions provided simply weren't clear enough
5,16-02-2018,done and dusted,daunting at first because of my full time job with defence for the past  years and adapting to a regime of studying for the first time in years looking back i have to say i enjoyed it because it was so diverse from what i have been doing most of my working life and defence force career the two placements really cemented my desire to be part of the aged care industry in saying that those placements expanded my ability to get through the rest of the modules particularly module  relating to dementia i had some difficulty with the video submissions for module  such as material being submitted and lost but we got over that the very nice and friendly email notifying me of completion once assessment  from module  was assessed was just brilliant and more so when i got home yesterday and found a nice white envelope on my doorstep containing the certificate iii and transcript it's been a terrific experience and most rewarding  thank you all at open colleges
4,16-02-2018,great way to earn a qualification in something youre passionate about,open colleges has allowed me to pursue study in something that i have been wanting to do for ages professional scripwriting and can happily say i have graduated and become a qualified scriptwriter because of them their openspace page was easy to access and understand although unless it already exists i would love an offical iphone app for it as its very laggy using the website via mobile and even deleted my info on my profile once logged in on my phone its nice to receive emails to indicate how much longer you have until your course is finished but i would like someone to actually call and get in contact should i be falling behind and have a certain amount of time left as this happened to me twice however everything else was very positive about open colleges and they way they operate kind friendly and fair with grading i would go with them again for any future course i may pursue thank you
4,15-02-2018,convenient study opportunity,i had a great experience course was easy to navigate and if i had any issues someone answered my questions i had some issues with uploading videos but i got there in the end in my own time which was the biggest attribute
4,15-02-2018,everything is good,everything is good it easy to learn and find information on open college
4,15-02-2018,i love the convenience that studying,i love the convenience that studying online gave me but there was technical issues and problems with the content at times such as the assignments being unclear or mistakes in the course content overall it was really good
4,15-02-2018,a great experience,a great experience it would have been nice to know prior to getting to that point just how much work was involved with work placement module i found it a little overwhelming at that stage with the amount of work involved in placement along with working full time and looking after a family of
1,14-02-2018,i would never study with open colleges,i would never study with open colleges again  as a professional who has worked in banking and finance and done financial accounting courses in the past the quality of the course material for cert iv bookkeeping was very below standard riddled with accounting errors spelling and grammatical errors   i lost motivation  delays with activating myob files ambiguous materials and instructions and lack of student support kept me stopping and starting activities and assessments  there was only one assessor who deserves a mention and her name is kimberly kim  she went out of her way to help students  there are  assessors who i sometimes felt i was training the trainer  one arguing with me about an error in the material telling me she has a masters in accounting only to end up telling me i was right the other assessor provides cookie cutter feedback  module  complex spreadsheets and budgets had college errors in the assessment  when given a figure to make sure i was on track i found the college had not even applied an increase to an item which we were expected to do in the assessment  when i queried this the response was i cant give students the answer   im not asking for an answer i was asking to understand why her figure was wrong  i didnt get any response  another assessor rejected a submission because he said the verbal recording was not long enough  we had to verbally record  short answers which at the most should be around  minutes after i complained i found there was no minimum length for the recording  module  for document creation was the most useless module  we were given templates not ones we had to create ourselves  it was more about drafting and finalising emails memos and minutes tracking using spelling checker based on a scenario but applying their style guide which was probably the ugliest i have seen  most students including myself found it was easier to skip reading the modules and just go to the assessments and use google to help us through  when you provide feedback to the college you find they dont take it on board nor correct the mistakes you find along the way   i have recently completed the course but the poor structure the delivery and below average course content are not enough to give you the confidence to work in the field  many students i have also helped over the  years dont feel they have the skills to enter the field of bookkeeping  i remember when i originally signed up that i asked about whether we would also be learning xero and was told we would be but only myob was used in this subject  its the usual sales tactics to just get your money  when you sign up you are given only a certain amount of time to opt out but unfortunately its way too early to know the frustrations that loom ahead
5,13-02-2018,there were times when i waited for a,there were times when i waited for a response and became frustrated when contacting student support services via telephone they were helpful and always had a quick response to my queryi would recommend open colleges as on a whole i found them friendly and knowledgable easy to navigate online and comprehensive online learning study materials and learning linksactivities
4,13-02-2018,cert  vet nursing,i was suprised that i was able to complete this course i was concerned that i would not stay motivated to do an online course even though it did take me a whileeveryone i dealt with was great i had a lot of support when i needed it and the support team always helped me when i needed extension or information overall i think the course is relevant thorough and easy to follow i would definitely do another course through oc again
3,13-02-2018,adequate but not recommended,originally i enrolled in certificates iii and iv in fitness and my experience was initially good whilst doing cert iii but after the government interfered and changed the course content i was forced do a statement of attainment in fitness before i could start cert iv this added an extra year to my studies and then when i finally was able to start cert iv i discovered it was over double the length of the cert iv i originally signed up for with  modules instead of  the experience was therefore not at all what i signed up for and if i could get a refund and not do cert iv i would but open colleges will not do that despite the fact that the product i bought is vastly different to the one i've experienced
3,13-02-2018,overall,overall the course was informative and worthwhilethe website however is not fully functional and there are quite a few broken links the order of studies and grades sections of the websites made it difficult to know where you were up to and the results column wasnt showing updated resultsthere were some broken links in the course notes and probably way too many links to other sitesthe tutors were fabulous
5,12-02-2018,open colleges were great to study with,open colleges were great to stud with i was apprehensive completing an online course however the course was very easy to follow and straight forward trainers  assessors always got back to me quickly in response to my questions
5,12-02-2018,i really like studying with open,i really like studying with open collages because of there portal
1,12-02-2018,absolutely terrible,absolutely terrible the resources they provide to finish the assessments are not user friendly i had to face tremendous hardship just to install those in my computer even it is uploaded in the system you hardly can work on it so much technical issues arise which was absolutely unexpected for me i couldnt concentrate on learning materials for all the technical issues by solving it secondly the assessment they provide to complete  which have hardly  resemblance with the study materials which is absolutely unfair if you dont provide proper material how someone will able to finish the assessments study materials are not good enough to complete the assessments overall i had really an aweful experience and i dont think i would ever undertake any course by open college in future and recommend anyone to do any course in open college i feel like i have just wasted my time effort and money by doing the bas registration course i hardly got any skill related to bas i finished my masters and currently doing cpa but never face any  hardship like this in my entire education life
2,12-02-2018,honestly,honestly some parts of the course have been great but most of it not so muchlots of waiting around and lots of getting mucked around there are so many people involved in the process so it makes it so hard trying to communicate any need you are also waiting daysssss for any reply and for grades you sometimes wait weeksfor the amount you pay you would expect a smooth process this is not the case there had been so many 'delays' and 'system issues' that it had made it so hard to even graduate i thought i never would graduatethe material you learn is great the assignments however seem poorly put together especially the work placement portions the course was also changed multiple times resulting in having to redo assignments that had already been completedoverall if i knew what i know now i would have never signed up with this institution
1,12-02-2018,absolute nightmare,i started my cert iii in animal studies with a very positive mind set which deteriorated quickly most of my assessors took months to respond to my questions i'm still waiting for answers to questions i asked back in junejuly  some just new very little about the module they were supposed to be marking student support was very inconsistent first i was told that a resubmission would take  business days to mark now i'm being told  business days their debit success team has charged me extra at least  times now given a few were reasonable but others were absolutely wrong when confronted about it their response was pretty much too badnow lastly i've been screwed around time and time again by the assessments team who know what a deadline is and just choose to ignore it i've had to apply for my second extension because they conveniently couldn't mark my work and hand it back to me before my course end date and naturally it takes five days  to remark  wrong questions you know what can help with that a priority queue long story short don't trust this company they don't care about you or your learning they just care about your money which trust me you'll spend more than enough of oh and save me your response open colleges which will definitely tell me to contact student support i contact them almost twice week only to have them rush me through the phone call and not listen or resolve anythingthanksolivia
5,12-02-2018,found this course very rewarding and,found this course very rewarding and the open colleges programme very easy and helpful to use
3,11-02-2018,my experience with open colleges has,my experience with open colleges has been good and bad  my course criteria was changed one year in so i found myself starting over which was rather tough alot of the work i had done no longer applied to the new course criteria  unmotivated was an understatement  however i pulled myself back into learning and finally finished my diploma  the assessors have been lovely  open spaces not so lovely
3,08-02-2018,the course was just handed to me with,the course was just handed to me with not much instruction for example i didnt even know here was a portfolio to complete  there should have been a list of things to complete with an average time frame of each  it takes way to long for assessors to grade students work and i ask student support the same question multiple times and still have to follow up my enquiry several times  they are very helpful when you do finally get in contact though  i believe open colleges just need more staff and need to adhere to student enquiries within the same day
5,08-02-2018,it is a challenge and that's why it's great,it is a challenge and that's why it is good don't think it's easy enough it teaches you a lot recommend but make sure you will make time for your studies
4,07-02-2018,excellent valuable learning experience,excellent valuable learning experience with open colleges i would highly recommended them to others the trainers and assessors were helpful and highly resourceful and the overall online learning method was fun insightful and flexible to meet my needs as an individual currently on maternity leave the learning resources were excellent however the assessment resources could use with some improvement there needs to be more clear and concise assessment instructions and questions for the learners to respond to at times i did not understand what i needed to do or was asked from me
3,06-02-2018,cert  aha occupational therapy,it took  mths to get rpl sorted then i had to go to a jp to get it certified when it could have easily been certified by a member of aust post  rn or a teacher etc in a small town that i live in like manjimup in sth wst of wa it is very hard to get a jp to sign certifications my cert  was not recognized even tho i had also done my cert v in aged care which supersedes the cert  anyway i was told once i had done my work placement i had finished the course i didn't  know i had  more modules to do i think things were not explained in detail and i felt lost bullied into getting started and overwhelmed with understanding the computer technologysystem used perhaps more detailed explanation is needed for the overall course before payment a run down on how to navigate through  the course is available but i am a computer novice and found many things difficult to understand perhaps that is due to the fact i was born way before this technology was mainstream  over all tho i had an experience i was satisfied with the support staff and assessors tried hard to help whenever they could i don't think the course suits western australian students very well as the time difference is a big problem or  hrs difference  i know this is probably the way of the future but its not for me i don't think i will be doing study via on line courses in the future if i could possibly help it this is not a reflection of your course just that i struggled to enjoy the experience i would like to take this opportunity however to thank my assessors especially renee pont  for holding my hand and dragging me through this course every step of the way it has given the ability to do my job in a professional and confident way we did it guys thankyou again
3,04-02-2018,could be more interaction with other,could be more interaction with other students and particularly the teachers who you barely ever heard of unless getting feedback from assignments
5,03-02-2018,brilliant tutors content and resources,open colleges has excellent content and very helpful tutors that strive to give highquality flexible education with a personal touchthe resources provided throughout the course were relevant uptodate thought provoking and very informativei got even more out of the course than i anticipated at enrolment and i'm very glad i chose open colleges i'm sure that my new skills will help me for the rest of my working lifethank you
4,03-02-2018,i found the hand books very easy to,i found the hand books very easy to follow and to learn from i have now passed my course and looking forward to grooming dogs in the near future
5,02-02-2018,open colleges was by far the best,open colleges was by far the best experience of my life  i did a business administration course because i wasnt too sure what to do career wise and believed that this was a good starting point for many opportunities the start of the course was relatively easy and they provide you with booklets and information for the whole assessment there is more then enough support from them as well they extended my course when they could of easily just charged my to complete the course they were very supportive with a large platform of other students to connect with and teachers both ready to help you either through email or over the phone i worked full time and completed this course in my down time and weekends when i could and theres no rush to get things done with no timelines just a overall  months to get it done by rather then assessments being done by a certain date very achievable and would recommend to anyone who asked also very affordable where you can pay in one go or on a plan which i paid off before i even finished the course so no need to worry about it once the course is finished
5,02-02-2018,best online course,i completed the certificate iv professional writing and editing in january   open colleges provided the best online course i have ever completed  the material was vibrant and interesting  the assessors were prompt to respond to my queries and they always marked assignments within  hours  i have gained so much knowledge from completing this course and i hope i can study with open colleges again in the future
4,02-02-2018,study on line open college a place to be,if you want to study on line open college is the place to be i had a great experience wonderful teachers who respond to student issues very fast however some quiz questions should be reviewed to alleviate the issues students were having as indicated on the student forum
3,01-02-2018,it was very very hard,it was very very hard started out okay and steadily got difficult had contact through the phone with the first teacher  but second teacher that took over isn't available for phone calls i was one of the students that the whole website and learning change it was very hard towards the end of last year i didn't enjoy that at allmay have got a certificate but it wasn't at all a fun course to do
2,01-02-2018,so bad,so bad terrible support or lack of so slow to do anything so much important information left out and very deceivingthey do offer course extensions and the markers are quick but other than that they are terrible and offer next to no supportcancellation policy is shockingalso money hungry and expensive

5,30-01-2018,i definitely recommend,after i worked out openspace i found the learning material quite interactive and at times fun i would definitely recommend open colleges to others and continue further study with them as i found the prices are very competitive the study website is awesome and the staff are very helpful and understandingthe only thing i didn't like was not using the study buddy system the whole time i studied i was too unsure of what it even involved to want to use it i think it would be helpful to 'show' what it can do rather than tell still unsure if i would have used it though anyway
5,30-01-2018,open colleges were fantastic,open colleges were fantastic i had a lot of personal challenges throughout the course and the student support were so kind and happy to help me by extending my course completion date without their support i would not have been able to complete the course i highly recommend open colleges
2,30-01-2018,studying online,i believe i didnt recieve the amount of support needed in this course to be able to study online i found that i was expected to produce assessments at a level even my supervisor found hard sometimes this wasnt ideal for someone learning i also found time an issue as a lot of the time i didnt recieve my assessments back with in a reasonable amount of time due to college circumstances the online forum was exceptional however needs to be updated since the expiration of a lot of assessments i also found i spoke to too many people about one issue and got different responses and had to meet different requirements for each person overall i was able to navigate the online forum well and for the most part did my best i believe this could be a great college however i wouldnt recommend open colleges to my family and friends at this point in time
2,29-01-2018,outdated learning material,outdated learning material unclear assessment material and limited support from trainersstudent support team was great though
2,29-01-2018,poor communication,i submitted my final assessment in the first week of november it was lost then found then part of it has not even been looked ati was asked to resubmit a section which has already been completed and was also provided on a jump drive said jump drive was not looked when it was eventually found i was advised i needed to complete an additional activity as i had been transitioned form an obsolete coursepoor communinication
4,29-01-2018,diploma of accounting rpl,i completed my diploma via rpl and it was a little difficult in the outset to communicate with them however once we got over a few hurdles the process went well
4,29-01-2018,this was a great course to do,this was a great course to do you will get an idea on what beauty therapy is all about i have really enjoyed doing this course i do feel it's hard to learn the practical side without the direction you need to watch a lot of on line videos and do a lot of practice on friends it is also expensive to buy all the products and equipment that you will need to learn the different parts but over all i loved it and had the freedom to to it in and around my commitments
5,28-01-2018,i would highly recommend to anyone looking to study online,i have found open colleges extremely helpful throughout my entire study periodthe online accessibility of all resources and information is easy and smooth the support team and trainers are all on hand willing to assist as much as they possibly cani even found them extremely helpful when it came to needing a bit of motivationi would highly recommend to anyone looking to study online
3,28-01-2018,i learnt a lot but,i learnt a lot but i didnt like the pinterest experience  i was sometimes waiting a long time for a response in my photos this make the process longer when i was waiting for a response for so long and then when i got the response and it was negative i could have spend that time retaking the photo instead of waiting so long therefore my one comment would be to maybe put more trainer on instead of having one trainer on  levels which lengthens the process when that person has to go through so many photos having more trainers would shorten the process and limit the frustration from students this would then make the course flow much quicker
3,28-01-2018,project management,the course is based online some areas that could be improved are the navigation of the modules  reference numbers are confusing to locate particular sections most modules require a voice recording as part of the assessment most modules and links need to be updated to be current and work correctly
5,27-01-2018,having not studied for many years i was,having not studied for many years i was a bit dubious about it but whenever i needed support it was there
3,25-01-2018,lack of support,i really struggled ever receiving necessary supporti went  months trying to resolve one issue with one assignment because it would take weeks before i was receiving responses it was unfortunate because the content was great and the structure of the course was perfectthat trainer support just wasnt there though
2,24-01-2018,inconsistent and needs improving,inconsistent and needs improving  i enjoyed the course and assignments however a lot of the questions were not worded properly or were misleading and did not fully outline what the assessors were asking leading to unnecessary resubmissions also in some cases the information was not delivered or taught before it was assessed for example some of the answers or information relevant to the current assessment were either not provided at all or not available until the following module and assessment overall the course was informative and enjoyable however the course information and assessortrainer's opinions were often inconsistent and not very helpful
5,24-01-2018,recommend it to anyone,honestly this is an amazing school i feel as though the staff at open colleges gave me a great chance to do the best i can and are all very supportive i had a difficult time with my personal life and they stuck by me at every curb thanks
5,23-01-2018,i have enjoyed doing my course with,i have enjoyed doing my course with open colleges it gave me the opportunity to do it at my own pace thanks for all the support i goy along the waykind regardssue
5,23-01-2018,at first i didn't believe that i can,at first i didn't believe that i can get were am at this point but all i can say is am happy and am grateful that i chose open colleges and there's no simple education for those people who think that it very simple no for me it was a challenge and i did it and am happy for that
4,23-01-2018,great course content,great course content trainers were always very helpful
2,22-01-2018,no support,open colleges let me do  months of my  month course and  months in with zero notice told me my course was getting changed this meant all the work i had done was not needed in the updated version none of my units were able to be transferred and i had waisted  months with nothing more than a sorry the only notice i recieved was an email saying to hold off on my work until further notice if the course was to be changed surely someone could have mentioned when i signed up for the course as there would have been some prior knowledge on open colleges side had i known this i could have commenced  months later the change meant i finished my course much later than i had expected which effected multiple aspects of my lifeanother issue i had was the turn around with communication from the support teamassessors assessments usually had a  day turn around for submission  which was fine however any time i had a question for an assessor in regards to any of my work sometime it would take weeks which sometimes would only be answered after calling the support team to also try to contact my assessorswork placement was a lot harder to find than open colleges assured me it would be even though i live in melbourne cbd for my course most main hospitals and clinics would not accept me for placment as i was not at one of the main university's here again open colleges would not assist me with this until i had spent nearly  months looking a list of places that open colleges knows will accept students for work placement would have been very helpful once open colleges was assiting me the only place they could find was a hr round commute from my house as not a lot of places want student's not doing a full degreemy assessor for my work placement at open colleges was lovely but was also extremely hard to communicate with as he was usually only available on wednesdays and therefore took a long time to get work checked by him for submission and receive any feedback  a few times we had schedualed phone calls but he forgot to call  it made my time feel extremely unvalued for a course that says you will have plenty of different support and assessors to help you you are really very much on your own and when something does go wrong the response time is extremely slow a lot  of time was wasted in this course and i would probably not use open colleges again
5,22-01-2018,thank you open colleges,i would strongly recommend open colleges to anyone that wishes to complete further studies or are wanting a career changeall the trainers were so helpful and the feedback and information that was provided was fantastic all staff that i dealt with were so friendly and willing to help and teachi am so pleased with this experience open colleges gave me the opportunity to study and further my career without having to give up my full time employmentthank you open colleges
5,22-01-2018,i loved this course,i loved this course the information was so interesting and the trainers were helpful and understanding the whole way through i would recommend this college to everyone
3,21-01-2018,diploma in hr,communication with the assessors and support can be improvedthe grading process should be completed in a shorter timeproviding feedback should be consistent for all assessmentsnotification of grading can be linked with student emails
4,21-01-2018,overall it was a good course and i did,overall it was a good course and i did learn a lot but i wouldn't say that student support is always supportive i was sometimes on hold for half an hour responses to emails take  days when i got hold of someone the support was fine but whenever you do need something it generally comes with a big delay
4,21-01-2018,review of program,well designed apart from requiring the assistance of familyfriend's to assist with assessment recordings
4,21-01-2018,excellent experience,my overall experience was excellent i managed to finish my course in time thanks to the support from my trainers in achieving it all course materials provided enough information to make you think outside the box
5,21-01-2018,you get out what you put in,solid course
5,20-01-2018,very good,i gained very basic knowledge and whats is what i need for now
4,20-01-2018,i really enjoyed completing certificate,i really enjoyed completing certificate iii in travel with open colleges i work full time so i was able to complete my study in my own time and when it suited me the best
3,19-01-2018,the course seemed interesting but the,the course seemed interesting but the material was very old and there was no support of the tutors also the student support team werent that helpful
4,19-01-2018,overall the course,overall the course the material student support trainers and assessors  was great  i did encounter a few frustrating issues along the way and mostly i did receive the support necessary to overcome these issuesi did however find some of the course material and assignments confusing and quite jumbled i also found a few missing items in some of the course material and also found that course material needed for an assignment in a said module only appeared in the following module  also my modules did not match with the trainerassessor modules when i referred to a module the numbers did not match up  i personally would have liked to do the books in an assignment from start to finish that way all the learning material would have been put into practice from the start to the end and perhaps a better understanding of the accounting system to see how it  all falls  into place much like the module for the payroll this same goes with the bas module to have done the complete month would to me be more beneficial but perhaps that was not for my courseoverall i am happy with the course i certainly learnt a lot and even though one module leads on to another it would be beneficial to have all modules open so that if you are stuck on a module you can move on i did not study for nearly  months due to a real problem on one module which made me loose interest and self doubtthank you and i hope this helps somewhat at this stage that is all that i can remember of the issues i may have had but the support was great however sometimes took a little too long for them to get back to me
5,18-01-2018,accommodating,i have finally completed my certificate and i am glad that i chose open colleges as they were very flexible with extension of the course which i allowed me complete i work full time therefore it took me longer that expected to complete and open colleges made it possible
3,18-01-2018,i completed the life coaching course,i completed the life coaching course i expected i would learn more and felt the assessments could be more intensive given you can actually start coaching people once you have completed the course
3,18-01-2018,i think the course was overpriced for,i think the course was overpriced for the what you learnt i also think that in quite a few assessments it was not entirely clear what was being asked of me and some of the questions weren't actually covered in the course content this made it confusing at times and more time consumingsome of the online links no longer exist and when asking for elaboration at one point i was given a short explanation and told to google it i thought i was paying to be taught
5,18-01-2018,i had a great experience,i had a great experience the help from trainers and assessors was quick and so was the grading easy to follow assessments and very interesting reading material
4,18-01-2018,open colleges was perfect for me to,open colleges was perfect for me to study at my own pace feedback and assessment results were given at the promised time student support staff were helpful  workplacement arrangement and process could be improved upon
4,18-01-2018,yes i would recommend open colleges to anyone,yes i would recommend open colleges to another in fact i've just signed up for my next course with them this week very happy and with the consultant who just did my new paperwork ebony carrick great person to chat to you when your making a decision such as direction to go in i found her very helpful great person for first point of contact for people new to studies
4,17-01-2018,i really enjoyed this course,i really enjoyed this course the content was easy to understand and relevant to my job industry it was very well laid out and i love the pie chart that shows my progress
4,16-01-2018,loved being able to study from home,loved being able to study from home the only complaint was the turn around for emails although at times the trainers were super fast friendly helpful staff were always there to help with any concerns i had great payment plan
4,16-01-2018,course experience,great support  easy layout and understanding of modules to complete quick assessment feedback  great experience  would recommendation for sure
4,16-01-2018,i received copious amounts of support,i received copious amounts of support when i askes for it everuone involved had my training as their highest priority the material within the course was more often than not hard to understand but further research helped me gain better knowledge of the topic
5,15-01-2018,just do it,my experience with open college has been awesome the system worked seamlessly for me and any issues i had were resolved quickly the chance to go to fiji to do my work placement was a life changing experience and one i'm sure i wouldn't have been offered elsewhere my assessments were marked quickly and fairly with positive comments and feedback i am now looking to do further studies and will be doing it through open college
5,15-01-2018,great experience,a modern easy to comprehend website layout with wonderful trainers who are ready to help you whenever you need it
5,15-01-2018,i was given great flexability with my,i was given great flexability with my course ample guidence and support helped me finish my diploma with ease i will definitely use open colleges again as they understand people have lives too and are willing to cater to your needs so you finish what you have started
4,14-01-2018,it was hard to initially get motivated,it was hard to initially get motivated and start but once i started help was excellent and i enjoyed my course would def use open colleges again
2,14-01-2018,this was my first online learning,this was my first online learning experience i felt like a number rather than a student the content available was okay but i found many errors in the physics and maths sections which initially made me think i was making mistakes but it turned out to be untrustworthy content messaging the various teachers i had didn't really help me  there were  days delay in responses this meant i'd hit a roadblock and either have to wait and stop studying creating timely delays or go on with study feel confused get a reply finally reply back and forth a few times and it'd take weeks to resolve it's not the individual teachers fault i learned they're employed as contractors who already have full time jobs so we get tiny minutes of their time this offline messaging made it very difficult to discuss maths in detail it was easier to go on youtube than engage with a teacher as this was only a cert ii it wasn't too complex but i definitely struggled with getting into the maths as i couldn't easily get questions answered i suppose it forced me to try different approaches to resolve my issues but the cost of the course and the way it's sold with 'teacher support' is a joke overall this course let me get my cert ii while i still worked full time but i was pretty unimpressed
4,13-01-2018,open colleges provided a wonderful foundation to then continue studies in a new field,open colleges provided an excellent depth of knowledge for my certificate iv the majority of the assessors are extremely helpful during your studies and the support team are fantastic however numerous spelling and grammatical errors on the reading material paired with disorganised communication for the work placement made it seem less than professional at times overall i have generally had a very positive experience studying with open colleges and would reccomend
4,12-01-2018,the open learning concept is great,the open learning concept is great if you are the right person for it i personally struggled at times with the freedom of no dead lines as well as the open book quizzes and assessments as they resulted in me not feeling like i have learned all i can from this course however i am sure that experiences would differ depending on the individual
4,12-01-2018,studying online is never as easy as,studying online is never as easy as face to face however studying through the open colleges they make it easier by having helpful student support and trainers who provide prompt replies to questionsthank you open colleges i reached my goal of gaining a diploma of community services
4,12-01-2018,studying online have lots of advantages,studying online have lots of advantages especially when you live in a regional area where course in tafe are minimal open colleges gave me the opportunity to take the course i need where no tafe in the next km offers i would like to yhank my assessor paolo for looking after me and all other students in the course thats needs assistance with our studies
1,16-01-2018,money hungry vultures avoid,i started a course but unfortunately health problems and finances meant that i could not do any of the course plus in the one year time frame i was unwell i received only  piece of correspondence from open collegesso i attempted to have my course cancelled but oc made it difficult so i had to get fair trading involved thankfully they cancelled they then went and spat in my face by refusing any kind of refund as apparently their admin costs were over the  plus i had paid themnot a very professional company at all i felt like nothing more than a walking cash bagedit  so i got in contact like they suggested and they sent me email saying i could dispute them not providing a refund if i use their mediation services which charge a straight up fee of  and then an hourly fee of   after the first four hours i may have thought they were dishonest before now i think they are downright sick ignore the curated reviews and avoid oc like the plague
5,11-01-2018,had a wonderful experience studying,had a wonderful experience studying with you thanks
4,11-01-2018,i found doing this course quite challenging but i am very glad i have completed it with fairly good grades,i found doing this course quite difficult at times due the information in the booklets werent really relevant to completing the assignments in saying this though the assessors were really helpful in explaining how to complete the assignments i also found that my trainer holly was really helpful in all aspects of the course she helped me in most of the modules as welll as the assessors
2,11-01-2018,out dated and incorrect material,out dated and incorrect material some trainers were extremely unhelpful
5,11-01-2018,i enjoyed completing my open colleges,i enjoyed completing my open colleges course everything was great i was able to work at my own speed being a new mum it gave me an outlet to deal with the baby brain the website was easy to navigate around and the staff at student support were incredibly helpful each time i called which was alot thanks open colleges for helping me find my awesome
2,11-01-2018,all over the place with marking,all over the place with marking assessments some rude assers didnt explain the course very well when signing up the list gos on never again
3,10-01-2018,review diploma event management,in general the course was ok and i was able to complete my units at the end unfortunately some of the material hasn't been updated properly so some of the links weren't working pages didn't exist anymorein addition i experienced a lot of miscommunication with the trainers  student support so when i thought i already met all the requirements i was then told i needed to do something else at the end it got resolved but it took me since april until now to get all sorted so i was a bit dissapointed with the whole back and forwardbut anyway at the end i was able to finish and the experience improvedthanks
5,10-01-2018,i couldn't get a job despite having a geography and economics degree from  and private music tuition history,i couldn't get a job despite having a geography and economics degree  years old tho because i didn't have any admin skills so a employment agency advised me to up my skills and recommended a cert iii in bstudies so i browsed online and found this open colleges one i enjoyed it and learned so much when i was stuck i received help and advice i found the workbooks to be thorough and will keep them to refer to when i do finally get a job i found the course affordable yet not so cheap that you question the actual certification
4,10-01-2018,enjoyed my time learning with open,enjoyed my time learning with open colleges my only issue was that i felt the wording in assignments could have been clearer to avoid having to clarify with lecturers as often as was needed
5,10-01-2018,my experience has been excellent,my experience has been excellent my tutor is well versed in the genre i wished to be tutored in i have had nothing but informative feed back in every assessment plus many extra attachments for further review i am now ready to join the world of writers who weave words into childrens stories i cannot thank you enough for the content of the course and the way it was delivered carolyn wyrsch
5,09-01-2018,recommend open colleges,staff are very helpful  tutors are very knowledgeable and helpful made whole learning experience so pleasant even i am an experience accountant  dealing with bas for many years i still learnt a lot through the bas agent course thanks to open colleges
5,09-01-2018,excellent,i had an exceptional experience with open colleges all the staff i dealt with were extremely helpful and understanding there were many times when they went above and beyond to assist me with any issues or queries i had about my studies the assessors are always prompt to reply to my emails and messages as well as providing me with essential feedback for assessments overall i would definitely recommend open colleges to anyone as an online course provider
2,08-01-2018,tough going,i left a highpaying full time job in the hope of changing careers and took on a cert iv photographydesign course i was really disappointed with the lack  of support and interaction there was little community feel the feedback from trainers was really light on the courseware was about  years out of date which is really poor for such a course i finally finished the course but am left feeling now that it was a waste of time as i don't feel like i have the skills or direction necessary to embark on a new career
5,08-01-2018,very good content,very good content helpful instructors
3,07-01-2018,reading material provided supported the,reading material provided supported the assessment requirements well only disappointment was the delay with my trainer in answering my questions maybe i didn't get the best trainer but when i asked my assessors to clarify questions they were great
2,06-01-2018,dose anyone review the study material before giving to students,your study material quite often has nothing to do with assignments assignment questions are not clear and can lead to incorrect answers markers expect information supplied in assignment answers that was not asked for in the assignment questions why did the section teaching you how to use microsoft work excel and power point  versions in  come in section  we have been doing assignments with those programs for the whole course teaching how to use them might be a section  priority also why are we learning  versions when its  they have no relevance to the current programs as they have been updated for easier use the help section and google were more helpful than the  versions of the microsoft programs training in the first assignment for section  the assignment asked to use a font that doesn't exist in word  even though i've completed the course now i still don't feel like i could be a competent bookkeeper because i feel more examples and activities of material needed to be provided to drill the methods into the learners does anyone check the comments or edit the learning material there are comments to other learners explaining where an example has the wrong information from  yet noone has bothered to update the material and fix all the mistakes i spent a day trying to learn a method not getting the correct answers only to find that open colleges had supplied the wrong information although the material is badly structured and not proof read i did enjoy learning in my own time i would perhaps do another course online sometime though possibly not with open colleges if all their course's are so badly set out
2,05-01-2018,terrible,terrible dont study here no one even recognises open collges so if you want to do further study at uni you wont be able to rpl plus not much support generic feedback on assessments the best support came from other students on a facebook group that students made themselves
2,05-01-2018,the content of work required was repetitive,the content of work required was repetitive waste of time and stressful i didn't go through this type of stress when i did my bachelor i'm disappointed with the amount of times i had to resubmit assessments on the basis of extending my answers further rather than getting graded
2,05-01-2018,i expected an online course would be,i expected an online course would be more online based i found it very hard to find people to assist in completing my assignments recording conversations peer reviews of documents which delayed my ability to complete my coursei felt that the last three modules were irrelevant to book keeping and unnecessary for anyone who has worked in business before you should provide recognition for prior learningits alao disheartening that the cover page never shows you are  completethe assessor were helpful and provided timely responses
3,05-01-2018,ok but in my honesty could be improved,open colleges was an interesting experience to be honest i will recommended if you can balance out your time among other things it would work for me if i had a correspondent keeping me in check with the workload via phone calls like how the work placement setup works
5,04-01-2018,open colleges has been great,open colleges has been great the site was easy to navigate
3,03-01-2018,very mixed experience,the materials are really subpar  incorrect spelling and grammar throughout as well as unrealistic scenarios  there was absolutely no interaction with other students so it was very simply read modules and do assignments was also disappointed in some of the academic support which was nearly non existent from some advisorsin open colleges credit it was very accessible in getting the work and feedback was always given and assignments graded quickly  i may study with them again but i feel like i would ensure that there was more stability with the support if possible i had about  advisors during my time which is so up and down my last advisor was brilliant though and should be commended
2,01-01-2018,poor choice of rto,poorly structured course with inadequate learning materials lack of webinars and minimal support from teaching staff would not recommend
3,31-12-2017,the training materials had an,the training materials had an exceptional amount of errors which made it hardsome assessors were reluctant to help excuses included the course is competency based so no help can be given this made it difficult as the course materials did not cover what was needed
3,30-12-2017,overall enjoyable,content was good platform was good and was updated part way through my course all assignments are case studies with some videoaudio role play components found the assignments difficult to understand in terms of flow it wasnt always clear what was being asked as questions were quite vague and had an excess of information or examples which conflicted with my understanding of what was being askeduse of the platforms messages werent effective i struggled receiving replies and took a few weeks to get answers i prefer to have correspondence in writing so i can refer back to information and have limited time for phone calls this was stressful at times but courseassignment assessors are very helpful and willing to give second chances if your assignment isnt quite connecting or completeoverall good experience and would consider use of open colleges again in the future for other diploma or similar courses
1,30-12-2017,total scam,total scam unpersonalised sevice dont do it
3,29-12-2017,amazing assessors but need to reduce numbers,the assessors were all amazing and always helped and answered questions right away but i think the sales team or whoever signs people up were not the best as they just sign people up without much information and sign up as many people as they can resulting in big assessments like the portfolio being a  month turn around for marking
5,29-12-2017,excellent,professional staff easy to use interface  access to all course materials i got much more information that i needed to complete the course i encourage you guys to go with them
3,28-12-2017,challenging but you gotta do it,this course was challenging and thorough and has exposed my workplace as being deficient in processes in a number of areas i found as i went i could implement straight into my work role i could see immediate benefit however a number of these processes take time i didn't have to implement rather i used as a guidethis course has made me ask questions of my workplace to question current roles and job descriptions to look at how effective my current role isthank you for providing those skillsthe remainder of my feedback is based on who i am and what i neededwhen i started it was like a punch in the face i didn't expect the workload to be what it was i needed hands on support and a bit of tlc and to begin i didn't feel i got that from the portals we could raise questions on i wanted to clarify responses from the assessors but was advised they were under no obligation to respond some of the responses i did receive where way above my level of expertiseso for the first few months i felt overwhelmed yes i think i needed my hand held the student support team helped me as i worked through my study program changing and revising as things came up in life and that was a breath of fresh airas i worked into this i felt more comfortable with the process the line of questioning and the feedback so now after  months i was rarely flusteredi would recommend an open colleges course for surei would also recommend where possible that open colleges attempt to assess the students on what works best for themi like to talk to peoplei like to interact with peoplewhile i understand this is an online course i felt that i was unable to reply to the assessors with a simple 'thank you' or a comment further about a grading i receivedi look forward though to receiving a shiny certificate that i can then present to my workplace and start to make some change
4,28-12-2017,i completed the diploma of accounting,i completed the diploma of accounting through open colleges  this is certainly a challenging course would not recommend it unless you have sound experience as a bookkeeper or similar role as you need to have a good understanding of accounting concepts and processes  definitely need to set aside  hours per week as this course has a lot of learning material to work through  it is self directed learning very different to classroom environment so you do need discipline and be proactive in your learning as the time will go by very quickly  even though there were a few hiccups along the way overall i am happy with open colleges and would recommend them
4,28-12-2017,a good online option,course work good trainers helpful would have liked a few more resources provided much relied on own web searches which can lead to incorrect info being learnt
4,27-12-2017,my experience so far,my experience so far has been very positive for the majority of the coursethe only problem i have been experiencing is not being able to enter the open space site my login has been mixed up and it doesn't matter which login i use the page won't load up and comes up with 'federation login error' and lots of codes which is preventing me to commence the new section of my courseother than this problem all aspects of open space have been great the people trainers assessors and student support have been very professional and happy to help with my enquiriesquestions
5,27-12-2017,the access to the material and support,open colleges made it easy to study onlinethe access to the material and support from trainer and assessor were excellent i could logon anytime and see how my progress was going
2,27-12-2017,poor quality study material,course material had a lot of errors and mistake which was picked up by several students more than  months ago but was never updated this makes online study more harder than it should be poor quality proof read before published and erros not rectified even was pointed outsome assessor that i came across were helpful but not all are the same
3,27-12-2017,not for procrastinators,this type of study is not for someone who cannot manage their own time as there are no deadlines per module it could be very easy to leave until there is too much work to be done although there was some email reminders and some followup i think it should be really put forward to potential students that they must manage their timein regards to the bookkeeping certificate iv i do have accounting experience however it would have been really challenging for those without experience i can't recall there was an entry requirementi did receive individual help when i was motivated to ask i think the openspace forums are not utilised enough mostly when students asked a question on the forum they were instructed to email the assessor directly it would have been more productive and inclusive if the assessor responded on the forum for all students to see and participatejoining a relevant facebook study group was very worthwhileanother motivating thing would be to have occasional webinars on each module to interact with assessors as a group eg one webinar per module per month run by assessor to checkin with the students doing that moduleearly in my course i had the opportunity to attend the college premises in a group setting to finalise an assessment with some teachers in a classroom setting i found this really beneficial it was only offered once for one module
3,26-12-2017,excellent staff and course materials,excellent staff and course materials the website had some issues either bug or upgrade causing login problems mid way through my course and they lost settings on  multiple choice quiz tasks that i had already passed then after being  complete i called and asked where my certificate was and they said i needed to provide evidence of a white card note there was nothing in my outstanding tasks on the web portal that said you need to submit a white cardi had completed this training on line and after forwarding the email from the education provider confirming my attendance and passing the material i was instructed by open colleges admin to print the certificate of attainment and physically take this to a gp to have it signed the gp could not sign the printed document at face value so i had to go home and take my laptop to the gp login to my email account download the attachment in his presence and then he confirmed the print out was the same and signedi then went home scanned this signed document attached this to an email and sent back to open collegesreally stone age process that totally detracted from the course experience the white card training needs to be integrated into open colleges or they need a partner they can trust and integrate with electronicallystill worth doing and would train with them again as the course was good but yikes the pain of going through the above i can't rate higher
5,26-12-2017,open colleges are amazing,open colleges are amazingthey have a large variety of courses and each one is affordablei was amazed at how much i got for the cost i was even supplied a large text book and multiple dvd'si'd happily study again with them and more than likely will be
5,25-12-2017,fantastic staff support and great flow,fantastic staff support and great flow of study my only hiccup was the re desgin of my course but that is a part of education of course i found that the staff are there to assist and want you to suceed very much overall fantastic experience with this establishment
3,24-12-2017,everything was fine until the last,everything was fine until the last couple of months than assignments became lost communication was difficult  and there seemed no consistency
4,23-12-2017,i found open colleges provided a sound learning platform,i found open colleges provided a relevant and thorough learning experience
5,22-12-2017,what a great company,would highly recommend open colleges to anybody that wants to study online
4,22-12-2017,i couldnt be more happy with the,i couldnt be more happy with the support and time i have been given to pass my diploma
5,22-12-2017,brilliant from the first contact,from the first contact with open colleges it has been a great experience the staff make your course feel very personal the online information and support from staff and forums is very helpful and i would definitely recommend open colleges
5,21-12-2017,a great way to a new career,open colleges was a great way to gain knowledge that relates so well to the workplace i've had an extremely challenging year and they were very supportive the trainers challenged me to try harder they gave timely and encouraging feedback when i did well i wouldn't hesitate in recommending
2,21-12-2017,not for the weak minded or willed very testing,i am not going to lie about this course it is very expensive and i find it to be very very poor in quality support and outcome i like to study long distance and have with other providers that were much better than open colleges the course material is very poorly worded laid out and is very hard to understand purely based on how rushed and sloppy it is there are much easier ways to lay this course out and i was constantly frustrated with the way it was presented including spelling mistakes wrong word usage etc there is no staff support you call the call centre and they read the question and then refer you to email your teachers who mind you hardly ever reply but the worst part i had to find my own work placement and then have an open colleges assessor come to the placement it was quite literally the most insane experience of my life firstly the assessor was so unorganised getting back to me about a date when he arrived he was rude to my work placement and down right rude to me he put me on show in front of my peers and i was humiliated after he left i had other work placement students say to me i am so glad i went through tafe your course is a nightmare and yes i have passed but i wouldn't recommend this course to anyone with no experience in the industry anyone with children or anyone that really requires help and support a really bad waste of money and time sorry open colleges but you are not a good institution and i would not recommend you
4,20-12-2017,it was a great experience,it was a great experience for me to have a course online i had some buddies who were excellent
4,18-12-2017,there have been a lot of improvements,there have been a lot of improvements over the past six months therefore i have given a  four star  ratingone improvement opportunity is  when a query is sent to an open college team member if the query is sent to the wrong person  the email response to the student is  this is not my area please contact    this is frustrating particularly if you have waiting a couple of days for an answermy expectation is the email is forwarded to the correct person to assist the studentsuggestion  provide a list  in additional resources which contains the contact person for each subject
4,18-12-2017,good,very informative and straight forward assessors are very helpful needs some improvement but nothing serious
4,18-12-2017,was a very good experience studying,was a very good experience studying with open college this year friendly trainers and huge support whenever needed
4,17-12-2017,learned many things,learned many things and think would be useful in the future i am quite happy of getting this courses it encouraged me to continue my education
4,17-12-2017,learning with open colleges,once i understood the learning online process and understanding how to self motivate and manage my units i found the process easymore basic information at the beginning of the course re housekeeping like uploading of videos or audios and that i could move forward on another unit while waiting for feedback on a submitted one would have saved me time in the beginningi enjoyed the course material and i learned skills that are relevant to the jobs i want to have and i would recommend this course and would look at open colleges for future learning
4,16-12-2017,the modules were easy to understand,the modules were easy to understand with the seminars the workplace portfolio questions were very vague but open space was easy to navigate open colleges was a good experience overall with prompt service and friendly staff thank you for my experience i look forward to my next certificate with them in them in the future
5,15-12-2017,easy use and helpful staff members,easy to use and helpful staff members
1,15-12-2017,appalling communication,appalling communication  terrible customer service i lodged an application for credit transfer in march   i am still waiting for the full credit to be applied in december  i would not recommend
4,15-12-2017,good experience but study meterial are,good experience but study meterial are not adequate academic staff are very nice and supportivei enjoyed my study
4,14-12-2017,they were great to deal with and the,they were great to deal with and the staff has been great
5,15-12-2017,honestly i really enjoyed my time with open colleges,ive studied online in the past for university and so i am no stranger to online learning i really loved learning here online through open colleges the layout is so easy to use teachers are really responsive and willing to help and students can call and staff are friendly and helpful on the phones my only negative which i think this is the same for all forms of education is the price but really apart from that  recommend studying with open colleges
4,13-12-2017,outstanding,this was my first ever course let alone course being undertaken online i found my treatment and experience with my trainers outstandingeasy timely responses from both learning support and my trainers making my overall experience very useful and enjoyablei'm actually starting a cert iv with opencolleges mere weeks after completing my cert iiopencolleges cares about each individual and they're learning and achievements overall outstanding
3,13-12-2017,mixed review  good and bad perks,although my open colleges experience wasnt as bad as others ive heard it still wasnt great luckily i was already working full time in the industry that i studied otherwise there is absolutely no way i could have completed this coursei found the marking was completely inconsistent and in some cases unfair one assignment i got a credit for though all the feedback said was fantastic answer well researched answer perfect etc then when i asked why i only got a credit the response was i give marks based on your answers keep doing what youre doing to me this is unacceptable after paying as much money as i did for this course to be told that and not how to improve opillathe work placement portfolios were beyond excessive and the amount of signatures required is ridiculous lucky i work with a wonderful team that supported me with it but for a poor student with not much experience working in a foreign service this would have been awful to put the student through that i havent seen the new portfolios so i hope that they have been updated in a more realistic waylyndal was amazing she is one assessor that i honestly cant thank enough she really went above and beyond to help me thank you lyndalrebecca was wonderful on her workplacement visit  she gave great advice and some cool new ideas and perspectives thank you rebeccaoverall my experience was average i feel as though there isnt a huge amount of support from open colleges but it could have been worse maybe for future reference with future students it might be nice if someone checked in with students every now and then to see how theyre travelling and if they need help with anything i think this would help keep students motivated as there were months at a time at times when i wouldnt have any motivation to study whereas perhaps if id had a message from an assessor or someone just to say hey hows it going is there anything you need assistance with etc i understand its our own responsibility but it would be nice to feel like our assessors actually cared about usalso i was very disappointed with how my official certificate arrived in the mail it was in a flimsy plastic sleeve in which it has been sitting curled up in my mail box all day so when i got home the certificate was all curled up after slaving away studying at my computer for two years working full time with two part time jobs at night and weekends actually finishing this was so important to me and that certificate meant a lot to me to just have a bent curled up one now that has creases in it you could have at least put it on top of a piece of cardboard with a do not bend label on the envelopeanyways  i am grateful and happy to be done towards the end staff were very helpful with getting my transcript and certificate posted out to name quickly as i had a diploma job offer at work and they needed my stuff asap so thank you very much for thathopefully you can take what ive said on board thanks heaps bonnie
5,13-12-2017,i love studying through open colleges,i love studying through open colleges  have studied through other institutions and find their support far superior and feedback on assessments very good would highly recommend them
4,13-12-2017,quality information,i learnt so much in this course that i didn't expect to it really opened my mind to the possibilities of improving the lives of others and also led me to look at ways in which my own life could improve the course content was highly relevant and it's such a relief to be able to study without having to travel to a classroom at fixed times thanks open colleges
4,12-12-2017,enjoyed my studies,enjoyed my studies open space is clear and easy to follow and i enjoyed the assessments that i was faced with student support were always efficient and helpful and the assessors gave great feedback on my assessments also having a long course completion time work well for me juggling my two children and work commitments
3,12-12-2017,the assessors were helpful and being,the assessors were helpful and being able to complete the course online enabled me to fit it in with my other responsibilities much more easily  however the assessment documents are full of errors and need to be proof read better before they are issued to students
5,11-12-2017,it was an amazing experience overall,it was an amazing experience overall all the assessors work close along side you and all assessor want you to succeed and do well in all aspects of your work the assessors and student support team are so amazing and caring towards there students their happy to support you at all times i went through the loss of family members and personal medical issues throughout this time and the student support line is amazing and have excellent contact hours i would always call weekly with millions of questions or in a stressful confused situation over an assignment and they would always put me at ease and guide me in the correct direction i would definitely study with them again after having such an amazing experience with open colleges through so many life's ups and downs i still completed my diploma in the endso thank you open colleges kind regards kayeleye goddard
1,10-12-2017,a laughable experience,for your own sanity don't study with open colleges i did a cert  in early childhood education and care and wished i had read reviews before being pushed into the course from there pushy sales people i can only speak for the course i did but everything about it was disorganised and the standards for a cert  were ridiculous many people i spoke to doing the same course but as a diploma said that most of the things they were doing were exactly the same as the cert  work the markers are terrible half the time i would receive someone elses work back or the feedback would be copied and pasted and not personalised at all some markers could not even write in proper english most of the student support team are rude when you have any troubles and send you away without a solution it would take up to  weeks to get a reply back from the markers or anyone on openspace if you got a reply at all there is a lot more that i could write about open colleges but its not worth my energy and i can tell you its not worth yours either find somewhere else
4,08-12-2017,perfect for a self motivated learner,perfect for a self motivated learner a bit of a wait time for marks but that's just because there are so many students and limited assessors extremely helpful assessors and student support
4,08-12-2017,diploma of early education and care,i did diploma of early education and care with open college there is a unit in it where i must find a family day care and do a few hours of placement however i wasn't able to find any and student support provided me with an alternative unit right away
5,08-12-2017,definitely recommend open colleges,the staff are friendly helpful and efficient  the course was comprehensive and i felt that the course work and grading was fair  communication was professional and helpful  i would not hesitate to recommend
2,07-12-2017,i had course material that was missing,i had course material that was missing when it should not have been which i needed to complete assignments and when i let the trainer know i was told they would look into what happened i have now completed the course and am still waiting to find out what happened and why i only got half of the learning materials for one module i also asked trainers to call me as i needed help with assignments and they wouldn't call me
2,07-12-2017,overall review,overall terrible communication not at all worth the money or stress
3,05-12-2017,difficult but fulfilling,i found it a little tricky organising work placement feedback from the school was that something which should be quite simple turned into something difficult  i also asked a number of times where the interview questions were and ended up being sent them after work placement was finished as i didn't actually have them  it was quite difficult doing the electives not having a webinar and not knowing what was expectedit was a challenging and difficult course but am relieved and feel a sense of achievement that it is finished i certainly learnt a lot more than i knew before doing the course
5,05-12-2017,open colleges are amazing,open colleges are amazing i have graduated my first course and look forward to enrolling in more in the new year i definitely recommend oc to anyone and everyone as they will surely help you to follow your scholastic dreams oc has a huge range of courses and the support they provide to their students is incomparablegood luck to everyone who are smart enough to enrol also try to expand your horizons and try something different oc can open many doors to youcheers cazz c m holloway
5,05-12-2017,in my opinion once we stop learning,in my opinion once we stop learning we die or at least we stop growing  regardless of age our status and our job title  we should all vow to keep our minds fresh with continuous learningunderstand that learning is a journey where you enjoy the ride and destinations pay your efforts and investments back in folds i started my journey  years ago and still going i highly recommend that you start yours today with open collegesi finished  interior design  i enjoyed that  kind helpful friendly staff excellent  coursei would absolutely recommend open study colleges to  everyonemodern  innovative   so i'm happy with it next year i 'll backthanks very much and merry christmas
5,05-12-2017,awesomeness,my experience with open colleges started off a bit bumpy with my course being superseded but the staff did their absolute best to accommodate my needs and help me transition into my new course  they had quick responses and very friendly with genuine care towards my education thank you open colleges i have completed my diploma of community services now and also obtained employment another success story and i found my awesome  awesomeness god bless lee ross
2,04-12-2017,things to improve,there were many factors that contributed to my low satisfaction with the course the study materials are insufficient especially those which are supposed to prepare students for practical tasks like bed making ppe or manual handling techniques what we get is a set of videos from youtube each one from a different author which are not very instructive and following them later in the preparation of the assessment results in a unsatisfactiory mark the questions in the assessments are very poorly formulated they are obscure and imprecise and this results in a lot of confusion and the necessity of contacting the assessor for a clarification i suggest that the authors of the questions give them to be proofread by a student first before attaching them as a part of an assessment to verify whether they are understandable the wait for the feedback on a assessment is way too long as very often it would be  days this unabled me to be fully in control of how long i take to complete the course three assessors is just not enough to run a course with so many students i'm sure that they are doing their best to help but there really is a desperate need for more assessors
3,05-12-2017,it was very challenging,it was very challengingthe tutor are very helpful holly was exceptional but is not easy doing it on your own the course material wre not easy to go throughi took a tough risk  but never ever again
4,04-12-2017,cert iv bookkeeping,i really enjoyed doing this course it was a bit challenging in parts and found that the assessors were quite helpful with the questions i hadit would be great though to get some sort of notification that assessments have been graded i found i had to go in every day to check and it got a bit tediousthe support staff were very helpful as well i would recommend others to give it a goi'm now looking for the next course to dothanks for the experience
5,04-12-2017,just completed,studying with open colleges has been a rewarding experience with the latest material friendly help and support available and encouraging assessors i have already made recommendations to friends
3,04-12-2017,i struggled with the online nature of,i struggled with the online nature of the course and the lack of communication from oc only heard from them  when getting a reminder course is nearly over or feedback from an assessmenti feel an email or message once a month from an assessor or trainer checking in could be encouraging and gives the student a chance to voice concerns or ask for help when they may normally just give upthe errors in the course notes also made it particularly difficult to understand what to do
5,03-12-2017,the course was well developed the staff,the course was well developed the staff were responsive to their emails and help in any way they could i felt confident that there was assistance if i needed it
5,03-12-2017,i received the much support i needed to,i received the much support i needed to allow myself to succeed  studying online as a mature student whilst juggling full time work  being a single mother brings with it many challenges however seek learning was able to be flexible with its learning pattern to allow managing life and learning
2,03-12-2017,the course and assessments need to be updated regularly,the course material took much longer to cover that the suggested timethe assessments need to be reworded  as they are difficult to understand what is required  the  assessment also need dates to be reviewed as they refer to the incorrect years the quizzes also need to be updated with current information regarding current luxury car tax rates not rate from  years ago
3,03-12-2017,hugely dissapointed at midway grade changes,i cannot fault the course content i cannot fault the trainers i also cannot give a  star rating due to my massive disappointment in changes to the grading system halfway through my course to have my final assessment record show a consecutive run of high marks to then the last eight showing 'satisfactory' when i recieved hds on all of those in my feedback comments is to be honest disgraceful i worked very hard to gain the highest marks i could and deserved to have those hds show on my final record grading changes should have been implemented from the beginning of new student's courses not made inconsistent for those of us who were halfway through again i cannot fault the trainers and course content
5,02-12-2017,i enjoyed studying through open,i enjoyed studying through open colleges  it has been many years since doing external studies  and my first time to do an online course
3,02-12-2017,average scoring,i give  stars due mainly to the course and the material some of it didn't make sense most of the time even though there is a lot to take in i think some of the material was not necessary the assessors were very helpful i must say and they were definitely there when needed and there feedback was always helpful i have to give an average score mainly to the course itself i think it needs to be reviewed and spelling errors to be corrected
3,01-12-2017,good for flexibility,i chose to study with open colleges because of the flexibility i work full time so needed to be able to study out of work hours and around life happenings open space changed significantly for the better over the time i was doing my diploma all staff i spoke to were helpful and supportive webinars were useful for completing assignments however some webinars were just the trainer reading out the information on slides which was not much more helpful than just reading the assignmentslide myselfmy biggest pet peeves were a some of the additional resources were not correctly referenced in the related assignments this meant i was unsure of whether i was using the right resource to complete my assignment the alternative was messaging the trainer for confirmation which leads me to my second pet peeveb i think the turn around time for responses to messages is two days i know that's pretty standard but with limited time to complete study it was sometimes frustrating to have to wait two days to get an answer to a yesno questionoverall it was pretty good
3,30-11-2017,i had some negative experiences,i had some negative experiences firstly after completing the first  subjects the whole course was restructured and i had to start all over againthere were a couple of subjects that i felt had very little to do with what the course was about and seemed like padding'too many assignments required participation from another person and it was extremely hard to pin down my busy husband to helpwhen i had finally completed the last assignment it was verified that i had finished but no certificate was forthcoming some unhelpful front line staff informed me that i still had  assignments to do she refused to listen or put me through to someone who could help as it turned out i didn't have any more to do but i had to complain to one of the coordinators to get it sortedon the positive side the coordinators and assessors were knowledgeable and helpful they gave detailed reviews of assessmentsoverall the course material was relevant and i am pleased to say that i already have got a lot of work in my chosen field
4,30-11-2017,overall,overall it was great  intriguing there were technical difficulties  such as errors  with the website sometimes but other than that just fine
5,30-11-2017,good experience,well structured course good support and timely feedback and results
5,30-11-2017,highly recommend,i switched to open colleges when my original course provider closed  all support staff from tutors to administration were extremely helpful and supportive during the transition and in helping me complete my cert iii in education support  highly recommend open colleges
1,30-11-2017,i would not recommend open colleges as it is to inflexible,i would not recommend open colleges as it is to hard to cancel if circumstance change and the coarse is no longer suitable
4,29-11-2017,good experience,would definitely encourage friends  family to look into opencolleges next time they want to study
5,29-11-2017,open colleges will show you the way   stars,it was time to make a difference  i turned  this year now thats an experience in itself omgoodness where did that time go  im happily married and a mother of  sons so my life is eventful and full on  so i decided its time to take up what i started when i left school all so many moons ago  it was working with children when i looked back over my reports  early childhood studies was where was i heading then but my parents had seperated i was the oldest out  of siblings my role was to support them so my plans for the future were sidelined for a while  quiet a while i have been in retail fo  years so i decided this year it was time to make some changes and follow a different path  my goodness it was daunting to consider as i hadnt been in school since two decades plus had passed after i completed year  i headed straight into the world of retail where i have had a long stint and been a successful manager of many years  but it was time  the year of  was to take a huge leap into the unknown and get back in the path i started so many years ago  study  with support of my family and friends i chose to study to be an education assistant  as i have  sons  i had the opportunity to successfully run a playground for  years in  at my local school  i loved it  my close friend at the time said to me  how amazing i was with children  now this is where open collleges came along  i knew about them as i had seen advertising online so i started  to read about studying to be an education assistant online  it my mind  no way i can do this  but i typed in my details and sent for some information i um and arghhhed after several emails and a phone calls but they were persistent for me not to give up my return to study   then one day in june   i rang and said ok  lets do it my start up support team where so supportive and understood my nervousness and reservations they made me feel that i was capable and i would have support all the way    i signed up  then fate decided to through a car accident at me the same week  ending up with whip lash and my car written off no fault of mine    i actually thought at this point that this was a sign to not continue or start with my studies what was i thinking  but with guidance of my assessors  high five to tim and many others i was reminded i had time and i can do this months actually it was hard to juggle a family  still work and continue on with my everyday crazy life with my sons now throw studying online in the mix   i was now in a study abyss  i lost my husband for a while in my craziness  he was my rock   but  the one thing i constantly had was the the support of open college assessors  my family and friends  they believed it me  i really think thats what its about for me i throw myself into things and give everything i have and get the job done no matter what it takes  i had many times of self doubtfrustration  even cried  thinking im in too deep but i was supported and talked through it everytime with professional support staff and assessors of open colleges a phone call or email away i smashed it through  in  months actually with great results which is still a massive shock to me and freshly digesting i made many mistakes along the way cried and laughed but still soldiered on  i was a night owl studying machine but with the guidance nothing was impossible to tackle or handle help is always there  my challenge was completed   i have graduated as an education assistant and my new journey is just about to begin for   thank you open colleges for having faith in me  ive done it  i fully recommend open colleges to leap yourself into your new career change or new study path   thank you to all my assessors  they taught me how to study again online forever grateful xx  stars
4,29-11-2017,studying aged care  open colleges,studying aged care  open collegesoverall the experience was a positive one i had few difficulties navigating through the course materials and satisfactorily completing the assessment tasks  i was fortunate in obtaining a work placement at a very good residential care facilitythe main criticisms i would have concern the quality of the course materials and assessment tasks some aspects of the material presented is repetitive in nature there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the material that need to be fixed some of the assessment tasks are somewhat ambiguous and their wording could be improved in many cases the assessment rubics fail to provide any real assistance as to what exactly is expected in the task many state that to attain a satisfactory the student must satisfactorily answer the question  specific details should be included to inform the student as to what is required for a satisfactory responsethe support provided varies depending on who you get to talk to with some staff particularly unhelpful  the assistance provided with obtaining a work placement is limited  in most cases work places expect to be dealing with the college and the application process is more difficult without the assistance of the college  some work places will not even accept individual studentshowever i found the standard of technical support to be good
3,29-11-2017,need more regular webinars,need more regular webinars  support staff are great
4,29-11-2017,review of open colleges,review of open collegesoverall open colleges has been great to study with  it has given me freedom with my time has given me opportunity to connect with likeminded people and has gotten me through my coursethe major let down was the time it took for everything to be marked i am currently waiting for my final result even though i finished all of my assessment  weeks ago there has been nothing for me to do but wait which is frustratinggenerally the instructors were polite and ready to help though i admit i found some of their comments and tips vague
4,29-11-2017,a good experience,the open space platform was easy to move around and learn the platform information could be more targeted in the front end to what i need in the st three months of the course especially study skills chats live recordings etc i had a good experience and learnt especially from module  and modul  as they related most to my position and provided me skills to do my job
5,28-11-2017,great experience definitely recommend,had a great experience with oc loved itjust remember everyones different so just because someone else had bad experience doesn't mean you will
4,28-11-2017,a great experience,trainers are approachable and helpful student support team is friendly and easy to access to overall a great experience for me thank you open colleges
5,28-11-2017,the best organisation i have ever,the best organisation i have ever studied with i have had nothing but a good experience with open colleges everyone from student support to trainers to assessors were fantastic and helped in so many ways if i were with anyone else these past couple of years i believe i would have quit as i had so much going on in my life but they understood and helped me alongthank you so much it was all well worth it
5,27-11-2017,everything i was looking for to support,everything i was looking for to support my business i got in my course the support was always available
4,27-11-2017,generally speaking student service is,generally speaking student service is good and efficient teaching material is excellent teachers is responsible and helpful if can organize some activity and get students to meeting and discuss will be much better it will help to made friends in the same area
3,27-11-2017,good career pathway,i enjoyed studying and i do feel more confident then before i had a great experience with trainers the website itself was very welcoming easy to navigate and motivated me to keep up with my studies the only drawback for me was the course prices they are very high
4,27-11-2017,great foundation for further studies,course material is generally up to date well presented and engaging i found some of the links have been lost and occasionally the solutions are incomplete or missing it issue there have been some instances of lack of explanations for acronyms and worked examples  nothing some diligent independent proofreading can't fixthe trainers are helpful if sometimes a little overloaded with work for some reason the trainers often have issues accessing the course material you ask questions about that is frustrating for both partiesthe assessments are great learning experiences and at times pretty challenging the assessors generally leave useful feedback some are better than others more comprehensive and some are noticeably harder markers than others the webinars are very helpfulthe nonacademic staff when you ring up are excellentoverall i found the course good value for content and relevance proofreading the material will pick up the repeated paragraphs spellingcontextual mistakes and missing bits and pieces and at times it is obvious the material has been directly transferred from elsewhere and hasn't been modified and updated i feel these issues are underestimated by open colleges in its negative impact upon an otherwise excellent course
2,26-11-2017,wouldn't study with oc in the future,i found oc to be extremely unorganised the assessments took over  days to be marked towards the end subjects the teachers sometimes took over the given  day mark to answer questions with some not responding at all  the materials when printed out missed out a lot of the content that is on the screen loads of spelling errors missing information in the texts assessments weren't specific enough where the assessors would come back and say 'something more is needed' when you've answered all the questions in the assessment  it goes onthis may seem trivial but for all the hard work i put in and completed this course i didn't even get to see the  completion graph on my profile  it only went to  as they changed some modules and assessments along the way and i did not receive my congratulations email like everyone else which i was hoping for after the graph didn't change small things like that can make a world of difference to some peoplethe other students in the course on the other hand were fantastic  once i found the fb page and even created one for myself and some struggling students there was a huge amount of  support towards each other where everyone lifted each other up which was a tremendous help seeing as there isn't enough support from the people at oc  that is how i got the majority of this course completedi wouldn't study through oc again
2,26-11-2017,inflexible studyat home course,firstly the course material provided was very easy to understand and the open space website is great to use being able to download assignments quickly from the site is excellent the assessors send back grades promptly with feedbacknow for the negative out of the  modules my course had i was required to do  audiovideo components this required me to either team up with an 'unknown' study buddy on the internet or ask one of my family members or friends to do my assignment with me i absolutely hated asking my family to help with my assessments  most of my family are shy and didn't want to be recorded and my husband works away in the mines what really frustrated me was when i called open colleges about this issue i had they told me there's nothing they can do about it i must get them done i even offered to submit the scripts i had prepared as evidence of what was going to be said they then said they needed proof that i am able to 'talk to someone' i told them that i am already employed in a position which would requires this qualification so clearly i can talk to people i just needed to finish the course because i paid a lot of money for it  this didn't matteri ended up finishing all my assessments minus these components within several months but due to this difficulty i put off completing my course up until  days before the course deadline in the end i asked my primary school aged daughter to help me out the fact that she can't read with conversation fluency made it obvious we were reading even still i was graded with a number of high distinction this just proves that it was really unnecessary to prove that i can 'talk to someone 'i think the fact that all my other assessments which were submitted which didn't require an audio video recording were graded very highly should've been enough evidence that i knew the course content very well and should've been excused from doing these recordings
5,26-11-2017,phtography cert,the lessona are very well planned out and teh response fro the educators are quick and very helpful
2,24-11-2017,my issue is not completely with the,my issue is not completely with the course and the learning modules but more do with student supportthere was many occasions where i was waiting on a reply email from my trainermy first trainer during my certificate was lindsay and he was great but my trainer during the diploma left me unsatisfied and stressedalso the call centre hold times are far too long sometimes  plus minutes to get through they say they will sort out the issue but  or  days later and i havent heard from anyone and because our study is time precious that puts a real burden on me to have to chase things up that i shouldnt have to be doingfinally i discovered on numerous occasions during the learning modules it says to refer to module  for example however as you open that part of the module you realise it has nothing to do with the topic your currently studying that needs reviewingthanks
1,24-11-2017,dont do it,i did cert  health services assistancegot assigned the whe wrong stream in the course and when i enquired about it they said there was only one stream but later on i learned that there were  and i did the wrong one but by that point i had finished they keep saying they will call me back about it but dontevery single assignment is a  pass mark so your first attempt of every assignment is basically just to figure out what the questions mean the questions are very vague and they want very specific answersi had to make videos when i was assured there wouldnt be any requirement for that if i had known what the course would be like i never wouldve spent  i would have gone and done individual support at tafe which would have been so much quickeri wanted to do this online to save time because the tafe courses were  months and i ended up taking  months the last year i have also been a full time uni student and can honestly say the first year of biomedicine has been easier than this courseeven now i have the certificate i still regret ever signing up for this i  wish i had read reveiws or joined the facebook group to ask if i should start the course
4,24-11-2017,i have loved studying through open,i have loved studying through open colleges it suited my needs very well there was always lots of help on hand and i would definitely recommend them
5,23-11-2017,my experience with open colleges has been excellent,my experience with open colleges has been wonderful the staff trainers work placement assessors markers etc have done an amazing job they have helped me with appropriate feedback and help me through my  years of studying where now i have finished and graduated with a diplomathankyou everyone at open colleges for there support
2,22-11-2017,poor course,very difficult to navigate the website changes mid course meant there was  a huge mistake made which meant i thought i graduated in septemebr but when i asked where my diploma was i was told i hadn't finished and had to g back and do a missing assessment from  months earlier  unprofessional all around nowhere near on par with universities would not recommend  takes too long to access course material takes too long for trainers to get back to you the course material was very repetitive with sustainability and whs nowhere near enough learning of software  revit didn't even get a mentionpoor
3,22-11-2017,cert  individual support,helpful people easy to use had some issues with getting placement sorted and taking a long time to get my final certificate after submitting all documents on my behalf overall was good and i would recommend to people who aren't able to physically attend somewhere however just be prepared to wait for a long time for some things
2,22-11-2017,okay,assessors its were awesome and very helpful but the course material had a few errors the site was easy enough to navigate but overall i dont think it was worth the extra few thousands of  i would suggest shopping around
2,22-11-2017,i was halfway through my course when,i was halfway through my course when they made changes to the course so i had to start over with a new website format which i found to be much harder to find my way around on when i wanted help id have to call student support which didnt always have the answers to my questions as they dont specialise in the course that youre doing they are just for general help
5,22-11-2017,open spaces,open spacesi found using open spaces the learning management system easy to navigate each module was easy to access and allowed you to work at your own pace when it came time to submitting assessments this was easy and the feedback provided was both detailed and done quick
1,21-11-2017,this course was poorly run and the unit,this course was poorly run and the unit materials and assessments were substandard
5,21-11-2017,i was so nervous to study i had not,i was so nervous to study i had not studied for over yrsthis experience has given me confidence and it was made easy from the very start getting help picking the right course to handing in each assessment i had help all the way through i did not come across any negative situationi highly recommend open colleges all staff from accounts to assessors and student support team all reliable supportive and quick to help
3,21-11-2017,mixed review but mainly disappointing level of admin support and communication,positives i found the feedback from the assessors very helpful and they were supportive and constructive in their comments but the negatives made the process especially towards the end of the course very stressful i finished two weeks ago and open space is still showing that i am only  through the course despite my having contacted student support for the units that had more than one part it was unclear that each part had to be uploaded in a different section when i uploaded all of my coursework in one place in error i was not advised of my mistake i only found out when i queried my status showing in open space a few months later i did not receive any communication telling me that my maximum completion date was upcoming i had this date in my calendar but it was disappointing not to receive a reminder i received an email the day after my completion date telling me it was a shame that i didn't complete even though i had completed and have received notification of this from my assessor and from student support communication in general is not great and inconsistent some of the information in the workbook is incorrect and i was marked down because of it this has been brought to open colleges' attention so hopefully will be resolved many of the hyperlinks in the workbooks are out of date or don't work
5,21-11-2017,great teachers,great teachers providing excellent and timely feedback admin people always contactable and helpful
5,21-11-2017,thankyou,thankyou it was a great course and i have learnt a lot i was about ready to give up because of having to find work placement on my own but the support team at open colleges assisted and managed to secure work placement for me i have now graduated and am ready to look for work
3,21-11-2017,communication needs work,communication with student support is not great important information is not always communicated all information relative to someone's studies should be given when a request is made and not after the facttrainers and assessors are wonderful cannot fault them in any way they are informative helpful and easy to work with at all times
4,21-11-2017,the best way to work and learn at the same time,so far the whole experience has been reasonably easy to navigate while i work full time enjoy my life and run my small business because you don't have set dates to hand in assignments you don't feel the pressure or the rush of a traditional school setting my literal only problem has been that when you do have a question to ask the  day turnaround can throw off your rhythm a little bit so you find yourself losing track on the odd occassion thankfully because the materials are in depth enough to avoid that most of the time it didn't cause me many problems it's just nice to have a school experience where the school doesn't believe they should be the centre of your attention all the time at the expense of the rest of your life  unlike most traditional college settings
2,21-11-2017,no good,the course content was hard to decipher there was missing and inaccurate content uploading video assignments did not work as per the instructions the tutors were helpful to rectify but many hours were lost trying to fix the issuethe systems were down far too frequentlyfor a person who has very very minimal time to study it needed to be readily available when i needed to studyi wouldn't recommend this to my friends and family
4,20-11-2017,my experience over all was good,my experience over all was good however during the period of my study there were issues with open space that hindered my advancing through the coursework in a timely manneri also think that it would be helpful for students if tutors could send a quick email acknowledging receipt of assessment piecesanother point i would like to raise is regarding the purchase of additional periods of study on two different occasions when i paid for additional time i was charged twice for my course extension each time the additional funds were refunded however i am surprised that this error occurred at all there needs to be better checking and communication between departments at the collegethank you for your support while i was  studenti hope to return to undertake further study in the future if you will accept my enrolment in the futureregardshelen maree barrett
5,19-11-2017,best experience  recommend,after studying at curtin university obtaining my bachelors degree of medical science working for  years straight after going back to studying was the last thing on my mind with some changes happening within my field of work i was placed in a position where i had to reevaluate what am i going to do now having a mortgage i really needed a place where i am able to still work fulltime until redundancy is given i came across open colleges online and that was it the whole experience was perfect angela called me when i enquired about dental assisting and gave me all information i wanted to know along with course details and pricing everything being online besides the work placement part has been a breeze communicating with students and our trainers through open space is great everyone on there is there to help each other lastly student support team is the same any problems is always solves quickly and promptly recommend thank you
5,18-11-2017,i had a great trainor and always had,i had a great trainor and always had questions ans help in a timely manner ready to start the next course
5,18-11-2017,writing and editing,great course i learnt so much in a year thank you for helping to grow my future i recommend the writing and editing course to everyone
5,18-11-2017,i have thoroughly enjoyed my online,i have thoroughly enjoyed my online course through open colleges and would recommend it to anyone looking to further their education i found the support staff trainers and assessors all very helpful and friendly to deal with whenever i've had a question they have been able to answer it  promptly i have enjoyed the self paced learning that this college provides to fit in and around my family and employment commitments and been able to complete my certificate iii in a relatively short space of time open space has been easy to navigate to see my modules assessments and grades as well as communicating with other students for that peer support at the same time overall it has been wonderful thank you open colleges
5,18-11-2017,i  would recommend open colleges for,i  would recommend open colleges for further study i had no problem with this organisation response time was accurate and assessor marking was fair and comments very useful i liked online study because i am self motivated and can work on my own in my timeframe it's very useful to view the recommended orientation video first and then learn your way round read all the written information giving to you first about the course read the forum's to see what others are doing i will be using open colleges again to further my educational career
4,17-11-2017,great course,great course easy to follow format and prompt feedback could have been a little more challenging
1,17-11-2017,would not recommend,i received no help when i struggled to find work placement everywhere i applied said they didn't accept open colleges students and i was so lucky to find somewhere to take me after  months of applying i waited over a year in total for my portfolio to be marked so many grammatical errors in the exams and assessments which made them really hard to understand sometimes the assessors were helpful and friendly though
5,17-11-2017,well organised course material,well organised course material the tutor was very supportive and gave excellent feedback as well as suggesting further reading and websites to assist good value for money i thoroughly recommend this course
2,17-11-2017,no support,no support poor assessments that are repetitive  takes a long time for someone to reply to emails poor set out of modules
5,17-11-2017,i am seriously loving my course,i am seriously loving my course i really love the online learning set upeasy and packed full of quality learning materiali feel like i'm getting way more out of online learning that what i had previously in a class environment all in your own time exactly what i need with my two year old and  month old love it so glad i made this decision
5,16-11-2017,great course,i had a great time doing my course online through open colleges could always talk to people if i had a problem with anything and the course staff were great
2,16-11-2017,the course should have stated before,the course should have stated before one started the course that you needed very good computer skills i didn't grow up with the computer so i found using it to do the course very difficult a lot of the multiple choice questions were very ambiguous  i asked a friend who is a nurse and her husband  who is a doctor to help me with them after i had failed them once and they also said they are very ambiguous they and i felt a great deal of the material was to become a nurse not a pca or a community worker i have worked as a pca and a disability support worker for  years and have never come across a lot of the material we were asked to learn the student support team was fantastic i enjoyed the course but i feel a lot of it was ambiguous and irrelevant
2,20-11-2017,a mixed bag,well after that reply from open colleges i have to downgrade my review  it seems to me they've simply tried to 'talkup' my review and avoid the issues i've raised well guess that explains how they arrived at this poor situation they still need to the learn lesson that any business has to set their customer's needs as top prioritythe trainers and assessors were excellent  positive supportive friendly professional and very knowledgeable they were relatively prompt too they are the only reason i've given  stars  it would have been much less otherwisethe course content was 'thin' in some place and there were quite a few broken links throughoutthe admin and technical staff were severely lacking  there was an ongoing issue with the site which they were aware of and no explanation or support for me  they never once returned a phone call to me when i had a problem and were not always cooperative and rarely proactive when i called them they simply set up a clunky and unprofessional workaround to the problem
5,15-11-2017,found my awesome,just finished my cert iv in project management i loved doing this course and loved the feedback and support provided definitely worth it even though studying via correspondence does take great selfdiscipline i feel i have not only gained that skill but also confidence in myself of what i can achievefoundmyawesome
4,14-11-2017,the course was well structured and the,the course was well structured and the assessors were fantastic and supportive the way the course was provided was a little difficult having to submit the entire portfolio at once rather than by each study period which i found very overwhelming i think you need to be a very self motivated person to be successful with this course or in my case stubborn because theres no physical class room there to keep you on track you have to actively seek out help yourself im so thankful to the assessors that helped me through the course theyre amazing people who truly care about you
1,14-11-2017,the worst company i have been with to,the worst company i have been with to do a course
5,14-11-2017,happy with that,my course was good and i had an excellent trainer in carole goldsmith always had a prompt reply to any queries and a good turnaround with assignments unfortunately i had some serious health issues at one stage and needed an extension of the course which was provided i am suited to online learning so open colleges is a good fit
1,13-11-2017,never sign up with these people,at the start everything seemed fine until my daughter got quite unwell and i had to cancel my course i informed never got a reply so i called and he told me i needed to contact the special consideration team he was very lovely wished my daughter to get better and told me what i had to do and so on so anyway i emailed them and that's when it all started so i asked for it to be cancelled and be refunded from the time i stopped doing the course they asked me to send documents which i did i had the proof for everything then they told me to keep resenting them pretending they didn't receive them then they made a decision to extend it  months and pause taking payments out i told them i can't do this as my daughter was in and out of hospital appointments i got no reply so i called the next day and supposedly the guy was sick then i kept calling and still wasn't in weeks went by and they still kept taking money out so my mum called and they said the guy was on holidays now anyways so i kept seeing when he was back in and they literally ignored me so then i said i'll be contacting the ombudsman and then they magically replied saying they cancelled the course and refunded partial of my money i was intitled to  and i got refunded   i called consumer affairs and they told me they couldn't do this they were only aloud to take a percentage which i already took out as i paid the fees at the start of enrolment and the month of february so all together  they told me to contact them and demand my full refund back or take them to vcat so i emailed them and there saying they'll give me an answer in  days which is such a joke when i've already waited  months so  days in the  day wait and they still can't give me an answer so if they don't my next monday i'll be putting my documents to vcat it's bloody crap when you do everything they ask of you and it says it in there contract yet they try to find a reason to keep your money they emailed once saying they were keeping fees because they send documents out it's an online course how can they send it to my address haha  hopefully gets sorted soon though as i'm so tired of it i'm already stressed as it is with my daughter
3,13-11-2017,my course experience was ok,my course experience was ok i found it difficult not having face to face contact with the trainers and other students finding work placement was a challenge as many facilities have contracts with other training providers and hadnt heard of open colleges some of the feed back from some assessors was unclear and waiting for a reply was sometimes inconvenient so finishing some assessments took longer to completethe study buddy system didnt work for me as you work at your own pace as do other people
2,13-11-2017,poor,the course notes complied a lot of read the textbookthe portfolio took a ridiculously long time to be marked and extended the length of my course by  months which is completely out of orderthe portfolio was a very stupid way to assess my work why not send someone out to do a day watching the person at their work placementalso the assessments were ridiculously marked i got them returned lots to add one or two things that gave me a high distinction why not just give me a distinction and not bother sending it back i dont need a hd to pass the course ridiculousmy assessor stephanie was wonderful and she is the only reason i am giving  stars zero would be given if it werent for her
5,12-11-2017,hi i found open colleges great,hi i found open colleges great i haven't studied since i left school along time ago and was quite worried about doing the course but i found open college's modules easy to follow and understand and the trainers were great i would recommend them to anyone
4,12-11-2017,good place,i have pretty much finished on my own because i like online learning but with couple of assessments i liked how i was pushed into reaching the good outcome enjoyed the course
1,11-11-2017,i would not recomend open colleges to,i would not recomend open colleges to any one poor service and when something needs to be fixed or asked no one seems to know what they are doing and things take so long to be fixed
2,09-11-2017,the education of their students is clearly not their main priority,the admin support staff were polite but that's about where the good experience stopssome course materials weren't very educational  often stating common sense instead of research based information  sometimes a quick google search would turn up direct quotes matching the learning material which were never sited in the learning material  some course materials had spelling mistakes and gramma errors making me question the editing processassessment questions were often worded poorly leaving students struggling to understand what the task actually wastrainers and assessors would very rarely respond to questions regarding material or assessment  when they did it was often to simply requote the assessment question back at youi was forced to transition into an updated version of my program but the way they chose to restructure the new program left students with next to no credit points to transfer and nothing to show for the previous study basically we were forced to start againi would not recommend study with open colleges as the education of their students is clearly not their main priority
1,09-11-2017,one of the worst experiences ive had,one of the worst experiences ive had with studying i received no support from the assessors i would need to send multiple emails to get a response and the response would say something like read module x x x x and x to get your answer what kind of help and support is that also i had to redo module  and  again once ive already completed it without no warning to at least say dont do these modules yet as we will be updating the module on the xxxxxx also if we have already done the module we shouldnt have to be made to do it again the students who havent complete the module yet should have to do the lastest one this is really demotivating and discouraging especially when you are doing it part time for resubmissions some assessors were great at telling and explaining where you have went wrong and how to fix it but others charmaine just say everything that is wrong with it but not how to fix it or will say i will send you this and this to help you understand but never sends it she doesnt explain anything clearly i had to constantly call my prac cente to help me and this is not their job to do this i was lucky and fortunate to have a prac centre as supportive as i did but others wont be as lucky as me most times when i was stuck i wouldnt even message the assessor because they dont help its like they are only employed to mark the assessments and the students are left to fend for themselves i would not recommend this place to anyone
5,08-11-2017,the teacher was helpful and guided me,the teacher was helpful and guided me kindly
5,08-11-2017,loved this course,loved this course nothing was too much trouble and that made it easy to learn
5,07-11-2017,professional service and good communications,i found the staff helpful and professional and my trainer's feedback has helped immensely with the course thanks to the communications i believe i have a 'leg up' in the industry thanks
5,07-11-2017,my trainer was great,my trainer was greathighly recommend
5,06-11-2017,,this course has vastly improved my knowledge and has provided me with a career pathway that i have always sought and dreamt of staff were very helpful and were promptthanks to all managers and all open colleges staff and i will  be recommending open colleges to all my family and friends because of the student support resources and helpful staff who really take the time with patience to understand weaknesses and provide support accordinglyfurthermore i am deeply appreciative to all open colleges managers staff and student support team especially to melissa nettle ruchi makkar suellen freeman angie kasper david parasol lorraine danos peter mcclatchey and joel borwnhonestly you guys have done an amazing job
5,06-11-2017,great system,great system  great staff
5,02-11-2017,i thoroughly enjoyed studying through,i thoroughly enjoyed studying through open colleges i wouldnt hesitate in recommending them to anyone who is interested in doing some studies with open colleges the material was interesting and exciting and the feedback on each assignment was very helpful provided by the wonderful trainer assessorsthank you so much for all your help and support and advice
4,31-10-2017,course content good had issues with course being updated all the time,my studies were dragged out my fault and due to upgrades of course material etc probably took longer than usual but staff were very helpful when i got onto the right staff member who was willing to assess what was going on and i was able to complete my studies assessors gave good feedback and im overall happy with the course content in the end staff did everything they could to see me finish my studies i would recommend studying with open colleges
3,30-10-2017,flexibility,next study period only opens after your previous study period assessments have been marked complete which after submitting take between  days for feedback does not allow for flexibility
4,30-10-2017,i think that questions  need to,i think that questions  need to answered quicker than what they are  quite often you are wanting to continue with an assessment and you may have to wait up to  days to get a reply to a question  have a look in the notes sections where people are asking questions  many are frustrated as their questions are not be answered  many of the links in the workbooks do not work  this needs to be rectified
4,29-10-2017,course was challenging,course was challenging but always got responses in a timely manner and found studying with open colleges really worked around my lifestyle i was able to still work and be a mum as there is no pressure to attend classes or have assignments in by certain dates
4,28-10-2017,course covered a lot more than the same,course covered a lot more than the same course provided at other institutions you will learn a lot more doing the cert  in education support with open colleges than with other places  however i found the support from the college was minimal and was dismayed  by the spelling and grammatical errors throughout the modules
5,27-10-2017,amazing team,it is amazing team i found my self lucky to working with them i hope so can make anther course in a futurekind regards
3,27-10-2017,very poorly written assessments some,very poorly written assessments some not all extremely poor transition to upgraded diploma in feb finished the entire course then after  weeks of no news contacted to find out i was required to do a quiz  which was blamed on the transition however i had finished this module by the time the transition occurred told it still had to be completed i failed twice as i hadn't re read the notes  after all i was under the impression  years of hard work and study was finished  weeks earlier it was a very unprofessional way for them to handle the situation i am still very angry about the whole situation
3,27-10-2017,studying with open colleges definitely,studying with open colleges definitely had its pro's and con's at times it would take more than a week to receive results from assessors which was quite inconvenient especially when assessments followed on from the previous one so i would end up not being able to study during that time as i was waiting on answers errors in the material were quite often found which made it hard to learn
2,27-10-2017,i found that the majority of the,i found that the majority of the assessments were poorly written and hard to follow
2,26-10-2017,a lot of trouble,trainer was good the other just went missing and no one could help me work material missing from course had no help when it came to work experience even tho calling numerous of times had used a mac air laptop to complete my course but if you needed help you ring the support team only to be told they don't really no how to help as there computers are not apple
4,26-10-2017,sometimes i found it a little difficult,sometimes i found it a little difficult to get someone to respond to my queries
5,26-10-2017,go for it,i have just completed my diploma in accounting that i undertook in april  being a mature age student  not having studied intensely for a long time i was happy with the help i received when i needed advice queries or guidance from trainers  support staff i would recommend open colleges to anyone looking to further their studies or embarking  on a new career
4,25-10-2017,studying is fun,i have enjoyed my studying with open colleges i found it very easy to just log on and read the information then do the assignments  the support that i got when i got it was great it just took a bit of time to get a response but i do understand their are limitations that are unavoidablei was so amazed and thankful to have such caring and helpful trainers throughout the journey lyndal especially it helped to take the stress off a lot
5,25-10-2017,i have had a wonderful experience with,i have had a wonderful experience with open collegesthe course material was clear and easy to understandall staff contact i had was of a excellent standardfully recommend open colleges to anyone that is looking to improve themselves
3,24-10-2017,stars but could really be,i gave a  star review but could really be  stars overall i enjoyed my learning experience the online framework had issues and it became more difficult to access course learning material  there was no real flexibility you had to view the material in an internet browser the support staff were really helpful over the phone the facilitator was not contactable i ended up calling the support team as they did not respond in a timely manner most assessors were easy to talk to and responded quickly some were certainly more engaging than others and gave useful feedback on assignments i think for how much a student invests in a course it would be nice to see updates with progress tracking two years is a long enough time to stray from the path and ultimately loose track of how much work there is an automated email or even a phone call to touch base because the modules unlock as you complete them it is hard to gauge how long each section shouldcould take to complete i think the majority of the course material was relevant and interesting i really enjoyed the assignments
4,24-10-2017,overall very good,i found that the course covered a variety of topics application to todays work force  it took me out of my comfort zone and made me stand up and address my work colleges which is something i don't doi found the information in the assessments scattered and in some places hidden  eg  one assessment was in the video assessment section  i thought it was just to upload the video but there was another assessment part thereover very good
4,24-10-2017,being a first time studier to online,being a first time studier to online courses i thought the wheels would fall off this was not the case the trainers and assessors were just great no question was ever too silly or too hard their support and guidance was always appreciated
4,24-10-2017,overall pretty good,the course and trainers were very good and im a naturally motivated person so studying online is a suitable delivery system for me  i studied and graduated a hr degree online through usq some of the issues i found with the course that could be improved in the future were i prefer to print the study material highlight and take notes i often found that the material that was printed was at times significantly different to the online version some of the examples contained within the study material was not adequate to complete the assessments whilst it is fundamental to learning to to be able to conduct your own additional research i still think it is necessary to be given more adequate examples within the course material the timing taken by some trainers to answer queries was a bit long some assessment questions werent structured properly or were a little ambiguous so you had to guess at the meaning of what was being askedoverall the experience was good
2,23-10-2017,c grade teaching institution,this course was sold to me as being self paced and that i could finish it in as little time as possible instead after completing the first  modules i discover they hadn't finished writing the curriculum and i was forced to wait an additional  months this coupled with their poorly worded questions which are there to ensure you fail your first attempt at any assessments i can only assume this is to make it look like they're assisting you study high staff turnover poor communication and buggy online submissions led to an all round terrible learning experience although i have since passed my studies this is in no way attributed to any help from open colleges and i will never enroll in any course offered by them again
1,23-10-2017,the learning part assignments was,the learning part assignments was pretty goodthe reason i chose an online study was because i wanted it to be quickthe only thing that hold me back was open collegei had to call more than  times i had to chase people to check my assignments i had to find out myself who is in charge of me again and againi'm still doing itvery unhappy
4,23-10-2017,i really enjoyed the online studying,i really enjoyed the online studying experience being able to study and complete the course at my own pace was exactly what i needed i am hopeful that completing the course will make me a little bit more marketable and job ready
4,23-10-2017,online diploma  the good and the not so good,the good  generally the material was engaging and relevant and the turnaround on assignments was excellent  i really enjoyed the course and would recommend to people who learn well using an online environment  you will need to be self motivated but you've got more than enough time to complete the  modules within an  month periodthe not so good  the links contained in the material were often not working and some of the material was a little dated and needed updating  i was disappointed with the certificate i received it's pretty underwhelming and the transcript that accompanied it  i was expecting something a little flashier and a transcript that listed my grades across each moduleoverall  recommend this as good value for an online diploma
5,21-10-2017,the people are helpful and problems are,the people are helpful and problems are resolved quickly the material is easy to access and understand its straight forward on what you need to do no ifing or ahing on whether there is much more to do thanks for making it as painless as possible
4,21-10-2017,great communication and very helpful,great communication with all assessors and grading via open space very easy to navigate the site and prompt with all help i needed only i found out about one assignment i had not completed unaware to me right at the end would have liked to be alerted of that sooner i guess that's what online study is for learning to be self responsible i should have been more switched onto my statuspretty happy otherwise
4,21-10-2017,life coaching,i found the course well structured relevant and easy to follow good support and feedback
4,21-10-2017,open colleges has a good support,open colleges has a good support network helps you to achieve your goals and succeed
5,21-10-2017,really enjoyed the aromatherepy introduction,really enjoyed the aromatherapy course a great introduction to this area i was very interested inwould definitely recommend
4,21-10-2017,studies were at a pace that was easy to,studies were at a pace that was easy to manage with other commitments the package had great resources and links although some of those links had expired marking  feedback were prompt much improved since my last oten course five years ago
5,20-10-2017,definitely recommend,i have enjoyed completed this course and although it was stressful at times the support from the assessors trainers and student support was excellent and helped me get through
5,20-10-2017,it was a good experience i learn a lot,it was a good experience i learn a lot i feel myself professional
2,20-10-2017,diploma of early ed course review open colleges,i found that a lot of the course material links did not work so therefore had to research the material myself i enrolled for a diploma course and the course books provided referred to cert  books so again i had to purchase additional books to understand course materiali was also very disappointed to get to my last module and find that we were required to complete additional work placement with no reference to this priorsome of the assignments were not relevant to the industry and i write this honestly as i was fortunate enough to gain employment within the industry about half way through my coursei liked the aspect of online training and learning at your own pace with no deadlines for each module but i wouldn't enrol in another course with them againsome of the assessors were great and provided helpful feedback as i progressed but unfortunately there was one assessor who wouldn't clearly read my work and ask for resubmission even though my answers were originally there which was extremely frustrating and time wastingthe course material changed throughout my study so i was required to redo modules even though i had passed i was given the opportunity to either finish the course within  weeks or redo these modules i think this was completely unrealistic and given that the reason the study material changed was due to legislation the college would have been aware of this information a lot earlier
5,20-10-2017,great organisation to study with,i was very impressed with the software for using the course material for vet nursing the trainers and assessor were amazing marking assessments quickly and always giving great feedback
5,19-10-2017,want to be a writer do this course,the course was very detailed up to date handson interactive and interesting it gave me a great deal of knowledge about the industry and it encouraged me to go further in writing as a careerthe trainers were beyond excellent they are skilled knowledgeable and always available they made the course very enjoyable major kudos to annette and nadinethe support from other areas of the college has been fantastic helpful and accommodatingthe course revealed my limitations but it also showed me how to overcome those limitations and hopefully succeed in the writing industrylove your work live long and prosper
3,19-10-2017,i felt that the majority of assessment,i felt that the majority of assessment were poorly written and were a great source of frustration to me as i was unsure what was required i aslo found that that the open spaces site was useless takes you  minutes to find the number to give them a call didn't track my progress accurately and the size of documents allowed to be uploaded is often to small overall i did not enjoy my time studying with open colleges i also found that the support that i got from my trainer was poor
4,19-10-2017,i have learned the certificate iv project management i managed to obtain 'top marks',i was learning project management all of the teaching staff and with marking of assessments that i had written were all good and very helpful to get along withi had serious surgery in both left and right of my eyes my disability from retinal detachment and cataract surgery is taking over one year to recover correctly i currently have much difficulty reading viewing two images closely overlapping both eyes at   degreesall of open colleges administration were very good to me with this area of my health and allowed my eyes lengthy healing time study extension time for this before i am healthy enough to begin again to complete all of my study to complete graduationhowever one day on weekend during september of year  school holidays i had difficulty explaining my disability and correcting this to obtain my correct information needed relating to the college's web page open spacegrades which i found was confusing and difficult to read  both because i was trying to read this web page from my home pc screen and  from talking with a young female member of student open learning staff by the telephone communicationthank you all kindly
3,18-10-2017,overview of my experience,turn around time on the portfolio marking was too long months initially often student support did not know how to help me when asking for extensions or to check if my work had been received when i was asked by the course coordination to check my usi number with student support student support said they could not check it and had no access to my number even though i had given it to them before
4,18-10-2017,great,the trainers were very helpful however can proceed in markings quicker over all fantastic experience i will recommend open colleges
1,18-10-2017,i am so disappointed,i am so disappointed with open colleges i reenrolled in a course because family illness prevented me from completing it in  months the first timeon calling the sales person promised i would not have to pay full price because i had previously completed the written assessments and that i would get a  discount if i paid in full i paid through zip money in full but no discount ever received so many promises and so much misinformation i was hesitant in reenrolling for a number of reasons but the sale person reassured me with the concerns i had i later find out all of the information i received was incorrect the assessments i'd completed were worth only  of each unit and because i had not done the practical component i had apparently completed no units therefore no discount in fees at least they honored the grades for each assessmenti had so much difficulty finding work placement and student support was no support at all i spent many fruitless hours emailing phoning and visiting work places  workplaces withdrew after they saw the amount of paperwork involvedthe information provided on the horticulture course information page is incorrect  it says you can follow nursery parks and gardens or landscaping stream but there are not enough subjects offered to do thisthe information page lists operate basic machinery and equipment lay paving assist with landscape construction work as subjects offered in the course but they aren't even available the problem is you don't find this out until you are enrolled paid fees and do your subject election formi could not complete all practical assessments in one workplace because they covered different areas of horticulture i could not complete all practical assessments in the  hour period of work placement completed in one block as recommended because certain information needed to be recorded over a  month period this course is not suitable for students who are not employed in the horticulture industry despite what open colleges says i was doing this course so i could get a job in the industry now i wish i had gone to the local tafei wish i could get my money back since i enrolled under false pretensesi do not recommend open colleges at all
1,18-10-2017,found this whole collage online,found this whole collage online experience horrible took forever to get answers back frok tutors took forever to gets grades back  just overall unhappy with the money i paid to do this course not to mention they left out information when i signed up that i only just found out that i completed my course to be told i cant have my certificate until i paid the balance remaining which wasnt mentioned to me at all until i finished really disgusted and disappointed i wont ever recommended open colleges to anyone
3,18-10-2017,well here goesat first their is,well here goesat first their is sooooo much information to read and grasp for me it was overwhelmingi took too long asking for help  there were a lot of anxious times wondering whether i could really do this i stumbled along and it wasn't until i wanted to throw it all in i decided to ask for help then life has its challenges and i didn't think i could do both but yet again sharing my experience with others gave me the get up to go i then got a routine of home work and study it was then that i really got things movinga great experience altogether just need to ask for help
2,17-10-2017,go in with your eyes open,there were a number of errors in the course materialwhat they don't tell you is that if course requirements change when you are in progress of your studies you are required to do more work this happened to me  times during my course duration the result was that i did  modules initially that once a change came into effect were no longer counted as part of the course this almost derailed my enthusiasm to complete as i lost all motivation this happened again almost at the end of my course when a module i had completed  years prior changed and i was required to do more work on the assessment due to the changethere are system problems with uploading assessments once you upload them  get a confirmation of the upload the assessments drop off the system and there is no record of the initial upload this happened a number of timesit's a wonder i completed my diploma bit i did thankfully  i was providing assistance from my course assessor which i was very grateful for
2,17-10-2017,needs work,i know it's a self paced online course but some more structure or check in by the teachers would have been beneficial the questions were very vague and communication with teachers by email was often days apart
5,17-10-2017,i love there company everyone should,i love there company everyone should use there company

3,16-10-2017,studying online is different,studying online is a different experience you need to be very independent and confident when studying ultimately alone support from open colleges is there if you need it every time i rang or emailed support i was guided in the right direction and felt confident each time i hung up the phone the biggest disappointment i had with the experience was the time it took to mark my assessments and get my final report there is a time frame in which this course needs to be completed and im just so thankful i completed it before my the course expired so all my work could be graded within the timeframefinding workplacement was also a challenge and once i found it i had to wait serval weeks for it to be approved by open colleges meanwhile my course was still active and i needed to complete it within the  month time period i was allowed this placed a lot of pressure and anxiety on meall in all open colleges was an okay experience i would only recommend to others who are capable at autonomous learning
5,16-10-2017,such a great experience,very helpful tutors lots of material to work with and use for assessments and portfolios and overall just a great experience
4,15-10-2017,thankyou for the flexibility,loved studying through open colleges with their flexibility and the access to resources and assessorsonly feedback would be that i would have like to have an email sent to my preferred email when there was a message from assessor or when assessments had been graded as i didn't enter the portal on a regular basisthankyou
5,14-10-2017,very good experience doing my course,very good experience doing my course through open colleges helpful trainers and fast grading  thank you
5,14-10-2017,questions and queries were always,questions and queries were always answered in a timely professional and helpful manner

4,14-10-2017,friendly and helpful assessors who gave,friendly and helpful assessors who gave great feedback and support never a drama or worry when studying
4,13-10-2017,i liked studying at the comfort of my,i liked studying at the comfort of my home and pace the trainers and assessors were good with their feedback
4,13-10-2017,i feel on line learning requires a high,i feel on line learning requires a high level of commitment as an older student i stuck with it but found at times learning the content required prior knowledge of biology anatomy the way organs function and chemistry i did a lot of extra research and reading to educate myself around these topics to then be able to study the course content and understand it and then apply it perhaps all the people who are losing motivation and not completing the course are finding they can not understand the content and are not willing to do the extra researchso i feel prerequisite modules of science would help when i suggested this to a trainer  i just got told to read my textbook
3,13-10-2017,open spaces,doing the course online was great the teachers help wasnt bad they did respond in a timely manner the biggest disappointment was the practical all the hard work you did and noone to see it some one should of been able to observe you whilst doing your practical  the phone interview was pathetic even my supervising teacher thought it was very poor
4,13-10-2017,the proof of the pudding is in the,the proof of the pudding is in the eating this i realised when at completion of the theory section of the course i had to do placement if the preparation for placement wasn't gpood it would have been a daunting experience especially  for someone like myself comming from a nonrelated  career background however preparation was good and i found it easy to blend in and hold my own confident in the theoretical knowledge i had gained during the course
2,13-10-2017,open colleges  extremely poor experience,poor communication  only way to contact staff is through open space and often wait a week or more for a response when i called student support at one point to find out why i had no response to an email received a rude email from course cocoordinator basically telling me it was my own fault for not using open space when i responded with further grievances and expressed my concern at the tone of her message she had someone else respond on her behalf had several other instances of disorganised or poor communication from staffreceived assessment feedback stating i had provided information that wasn't correct checked resources and was no mention of said information when i asked the lecturer where this information was she told me it's just assumed you should know thatassessment materials are poorly formatted  spent more time changing reformatting tables and text sizing in templates than actually completing the assessment in some caseshad to wait months for updated video resources on an assessment because the only version available was outdated and didn't contain information needed to complete current assessmenthad many other poor experiences during my enrollment with this rto wouldn't recommend them at all
1,13-10-2017,this training provider is unorganized,this training provider is unorganized and unprofessional they have not delivered very timely service as according to the course plan waiting months to do a phone interview that is supposed to be conducted during the work placement i have learnt nothing the material was literally based off google and youtube the workbooks had links that don't work despite being reported months ago full of typos and missing information i recommend studying elsewhere not worth the money or time this has cost me
4,13-10-2017,going back to study after  years was,going back to study after  years was not easyi registered for my cert  tae  i shut it down for  months after i opened it as i had not done online study beforei have a lot to thank jessica for ringing and encouraging me to get started along the way helen macmahon  jody and michelle christie were a big help in guiding me thanks again
1,12-10-2017,not as advertised  no support  horrible staff,i embarked on this course with high hopes i quickly realised that the support i had been promised did not exist the information on their website was so out of date trying to organize my placement was a nightmare i was told that open colleges would support me in finding a placement but when it came to it and i asked for help they told me i had to approach  places and be denied before they would step in and help so i did it myself the information i was provided was all over the place i had no idea what documents i needed as i couldn't find a comprehensive list and none of the support staff could tell me either i was just transferred on the phone and given different email addresses which took days to reply when ever i asked for support from an assessor i was met with condescending remarks i was disappointed when i completed my placement following the instructions on one document but at the end i was told that there was a different document with new instructions that i had not followed so i had to complete extra work after my placement i was anxious that this would make me look bad in the eyes of the staff at my placement where i was hoping to get a job but after i explained all the difficulty i had been experiencing with open colleges and a quick look at some online reviews they were quite understandingno one from open colleges has ever called or emailed to offer any support often if you call the student support number you sit on hold for an unbelievably long timemany of the assignments in my course do not come with clear instructions if i get stuck on a question i'll look in the student coversation section relating to that assignment i'll see that many students have been getting stuck on the exact same question over a course of months or years because the wording needs to be changed or the question needs to be made clearer but the assessors post rude and condescending replies to students instead of changing the questionsthis has been an absolute waste of my time and money i would not recommend open colleges to anyone
5,12-10-2017,i would have preferred a classroom,i would have preferred a classroom environment to study but as this seemed my only option as online studying go it was an easy process once i had navigated and mastered my way on the website communication was often slow with assessors if i had questions
5,12-10-2017,education support,i have completed my certificate  in education support and found open colleges very supportive and great to work with
5,12-10-2017,i would recommend open colleges to,i would recommend open colleges to anyone who is looking for flexible learning while working full time and family commitments  i am  very grateful that i have the chance to graduate my diploma of accounting through open colleges  also highly appreciated open colleges team for their support when i needed itthank you open colleges
1,11-10-2017,sharing personal information and no support,i put a complaint in half way through my study due to one of their trainers illegally sharing my information without my permission i showed the evidence to which they thoroughly denied it and renewed my course as a 'sorry' by that point i decided i wouldn't study with them and pulled out i didn't want to risk them giving my personal information to anyone else before they were giving out my security details there was little support for help no constructive feedback it almost felt like you were pestering them when asking why something hadn't been marked when it was sent off  weeks ago they say only  business days the company is a con read the reviews before you loose your money and potentially put your security at risk do not waste your money or time
4,11-10-2017,was a good experience and it is very,was a good experience and it is very flexible to my lifestyledidnt like the video assignments felt a bit intrusive asking people to be filmed and then posted on the internet to share to a total stranger behind a screenoverall was a very good experience
5,11-10-2017,fantastic experience,fantastic experience the content of the course was fantastic easy to understand well structured and supported by great webinars videos and case studies i was able to complete this course while studying full time and was able to use my work experience to complete my assessments both theory and oral the online portal made studying online simple easy to navigate and stress free the trainers and support staff were always available to help would recommend this course to everyone project management is applicable across industry
5,11-10-2017,best online course provider,easy to use online systems the assessors also very approachable and communicate on time and give feedback
3,10-10-2017,open colleges review,the video assignments were a nightmare to upload and get marked it was difficult to find the contact phone number for student support or the email addressit was very disappointing to see that the marking time frame had changed from  business days to  and yet there was no communication to students regarding this changeit was very slow to get modules unlocked and i had to contact student support multiple times when i completed all the assignments the status of my course didnt read  and the completion email wasnt sent to me until after i contact student support to confirm i had completed everything necessarybeing able to study at my own pace in my own time was excellent but difficult to find placement being an online course
4,10-10-2017,i would like to thank all the staff at,i would like to thank all the staff at open colleges it has been a delight being able to study through you and when in doubt my trainers were there to push me in the right direction i enjoyed studying through this course with the highs and the lows and the omg i can't do this but kept on going
5,10-10-2017,fantastic support,great subjects and friendly tutors they regularly reach out to offer assistance so glad i did my course with them
5,10-10-2017,very good experience,i found the whole experience from start to finish very easy to understandand follow  when i needed student support they were great  good feedback from my assessors with relevant recommendations
5,09-10-2017,trainers were great,trainers were great offering you all the help and support you needed  very good course
5,09-10-2017,diploma of project management,course was great everything i expected on line tutorials were a great way to study better than wading through tomes of text assessors provided comprehensive timely feedback which was excellent support admin and student support was also excellent
5,09-10-2017,reflection,open colleges has helped me develop my knowledge in the area of youth work it has open my mind up to different areas that i will be working in and knowing how to deal with different situations it has been a valuable experience and the support with open colleges has been nothing but amazing being qualified feels amazing and now i will be able to put what i have learnt into action with work and feel so much more confidentthank you for everything i am very grateful
2,08-10-2017,pretty average,while some of the staff are helpful others would not care less about the quality of work you do when you bring an issue up of lack of support they simply tell you there is plenty and not where to find it many students struggle finding work placement as most clinics do not want to deal with oc and have stated so because oc expects too much from both the clinic and the student but again when this issue is brought up we are told it's not true overall it can be good for people who learn via reading along with no explanation as you would expect from an online course but the support they say they provide is pretty much nonexistent they are not consistent in their markings for grades i have passed with hd while others who almost have word for word have failed the workbooks are outdated and you will use google for all your information
3,08-10-2017,learning material is great,learning material is great marking period could be improved a bit workplace hours part of the course is too much log book and assessments are ok but then having follow up phone calls that go through the same things as the assessments and workplace activities is just beyond ridiculous felt like course was never going to end
5,08-10-2017,open colleges perfect for online education,open colleges was an extremely positive experience from the course itself to the facilitators and  assessors communication was prompt assignments were assessed and feedback given within  days allowing for continued momentum  i would highly recommend openncolleges for online education at no point was i disappointed professional from beginning to end
5,07-10-2017,completed my course and such an amazing feeling,it was really good that i could study whenever i could and when i was stuck with few problems on assignment there were lot of support from assessors definetly recommend to anyone that would like to study online this course was very challenging but with amazing support it made it possible
3,06-10-2017,no support in finding a workplace,no support in finding a workplace assessors didnt know if i was completing version a or b assessments took too long to be marked and i had to extend my course twiceoverall i'm not even excited about completing my course as everything just dragged out too long
2,06-10-2017,only if i have no other choice,constant tech difficulties causing delays in marking assignments access to course material etc and lack of support from trainers eg 'i can't tell you if that's correct but you are on the right track ' this feedback was not helpful or supportive to the question askedas head office is based in sydney staff had little or incorrect advice when discussing interstate requirementsmost admin staff were helpful and courteous even when things went wrong  which seemed often the smoothest part of the whole thing was the direct debit company which is outsourced as i had to change accounts a few times and they did it without fuss or errorif you decide to take on an  month course aim to have it completed in under  months as it will take  months for the behind the scenes things to be done and then another  weeks for your certificate to arrive in the post
5,06-10-2017,amazing,amazing staff and course was well set out
3,05-10-2017,the quality of study material needs,the quality of study material needs improving  quality of layout at the start was far superior to what was received towards end of course  some sections had too much content and some had too little  answers to all activities should be provided within written material so student can check their learning progress as this service is not offered by trainers  learning material changes too frequently  having separate pdfs for each chapter within one study module makes hard to electronically search material for answers and study functions  suggest going back to one pdf per study module  several mistakes in study material and found a lot of information repeated over the course
5,05-10-2017,my experience with open college was,my experience with open college was fantastic they were very supportive and i enjoyed my experience studying through themcheers cindy
4,05-10-2017,i found everything great material was,i found everything great material was easy to follow teachers and support were helpfull only problem was loading video on there services

3,03-10-2017,my journey has been tougher than i,my journey has been tougher than i expected i chose the program because i was pregnant and need something to do after i gave birth because of health reasons i stopped working earlier than i have planned  which made it difficult to  pay my fee the other people from debt collectors even called me whilst i was in labor to discuss money that i didn't have which was heart breaking two days after i gave birth i called open colleges the first i talked to was so mean you don't plan to be sick and not able to pay your debt we didn't understand each other with this first person so i was referred to this lovely lady who made my payment journey easier and less stressful the study support team were really good they helped me to finish my course i just received my certificate yesterday and got offered a good discount which i was able to pay with my little savings i haven't worked for more than two years and a half because of health reasonsthank you all the good staff from open college and to those terrible ones you need to improve sickness can affect anyone at any time and you will struggle to make live a normal life because of stress
2,03-10-2017,disappointing course,course material was poorly written lots of errors some tutors helpful other not so management were rude and not willing to help with getting issues fixedi would not do another course with open colleges as it was not a pleasant experience which was disappointing
3,03-10-2017,poor quality course,the course material in illustration and drawing made easy is clearly very old and the quality of images in the pdf document is poorthe best thing about the course is that it got me to put in the practice to do the assignments and it's good to get feedback from the course assessor for each assignment i'm pleased with my improvement over the duration of the coursei cannot emphasize enough that the course material needs updating and needs to be better quality it was not worth paying  for it i found much more useful instruction for free on youtube as well as through free online learning courses
5,03-10-2017,very in depth and enlightening course,very in depth and enlightening course something you can really sink your teeth into and strive for more great all round experience
3,03-10-2017,i had an overall pretty good experience,i had an overall pretty good experience doing my course through open colleges however i did have to ask for a month extension twice due to the fact that the markers having such a high marking load and therefore it did take a long tie for them to get back to me with results and therefore i did have to ask for these extensions i also waited close to  weeks for an assessment that was never coming as the assessor had spelt y name wrong when sending my result through and therefore i never got it until i emailed them a few time other then that open colleges support call staff have been wonderful and i would recommend then to family and friends
5,03-10-2017,a rewarding experience,open colleges has an excellent online learning platform the course material is relevant and up to date i felt so supported by the assessors  trainers they are beautiful caring people who genuinely want the best for their students learning a great experience thank you

4,02-10-2017,good experience,good experience i've really enjoyed my studying and they were very helpful i would highly recommend open colleges for anyone thinking of taking on a course
5,02-10-2017,i really appreciate to my assessor,i really appreciate to my assessor jeffrey and all staffit was a great time and great knowledge i really recommend this company to all of my friends
3,02-10-2017,what i did like  as above,what i did like  i did have good support and my tutors got back to me in a timely manner with the answers i required in order to continue with my studieswhat i struggled with  i did not enjoy completing the audiovideo component of my assessments regularly  i had already shown my skills in interacting and leading meetings and felt that doing these role play situations were not developing my skills in any way  i know that the teachers said it was required so that i understand the topic thoroughly but it had already been shown in the assessments i had already completed in each topic  eg having a meeting about payroll did not show that i was capable of processing payroll as i had already demonstrated this in the st assessmenti found this component of the course frustrating also given that i was not in an environment where i could utilise work staff to complete these role plays  i had to write scripts for my  and  year old sons so that they could act out the scenariosi found i spent a lot of time converting files etc so that my lecturers could access my audiovideo files which was also frustrating
4,01-10-2017,i found this course to be thorough and,i found this course to be thorough and set out easily in terms of learning and information  probably for me i found it a little difficult in terms of connecting with the trainer as sometimes it took a few days for an email to be answered not all the time but i think to get maximum out of this course it is best to hook up with a study buddy which i did not dothe facebook page helped with connecting with fellow studentsi have recommended this course to people i know
4,01-10-2017,great experience,the modules were useful and relevant as well as the assessments i wish there were more practical assessments than theoretical the time in responding to questions should improve to be honest but overall the time i spent during my studies in open colleges was worth enough to improve my knowledge and skills in business administration i would definitely recommend this to my friends
4,01-10-2017,overall it was good,overall it was good assessors need to all consistently give feedback there were a few links that now do not exist accessors need to respond to messages and view comments on open space as there were messages from people studying that were not being answered
5,01-10-2017,if you can keep yourself motivated then,if you can keep yourself motivated then open colleges is perfect and if you cant motivate yourself the support is definately there
4,29-09-2017,great place for online studying,great place for online studying the assessors are very helpful and friendly easy to follow courses
4,29-09-2017,editing and proofreading course,i really enjoyed the course i took with open colleges the tutor was supportive and answered questions comprehensively i worked through the course material at my own pace i prefer to study alone but the offer of study buddies or discussion boards was always availablewould definitely recommend taking a course through open colleges
4,28-09-2017,the course material was of a great,the course material was of a great quality and the staff feedback was quick and efficient
3,28-09-2017,open colleges was satisfactory,open colleges was satisfactory although it provided me with the information i needed to complete the certification it did not provide enough personal support to aid me when needed and was slow when reporting back on assignments if i were to do this certification again i would choose a company who was able to have trainers come out and work with me or have in person classes available to develop my skills
1,28-09-2017,i believe more consultation with staff,i believe more consultation with staff members is required i have had a number of different contacts throughout my time doing this course the only teacher that i would say gave me excellent advice would be monica she is amazing as for everyone else i wouldn't recommend this course or online business to anyone i have advised my hr department not to put anyone forward for this again
5,27-09-2017,excellent,effective prompt supportive informative friendly just plain excellent
2,27-09-2017,the learning material for the diploma,the learning material for the diploma in management and leadership is poorly written communication with the assessors is poor as they deem  day responses acceptable i wouldn't recommend open space to my family and friends
5,27-09-2017,excellent student support,excellent student support a great deal of above and beyond help through the deaths of my elderly parents and personal medical issues can't express how helpful and accommodating open colleges were a brilliant way to study highly recommended as a study option for mature age students i am well into my fifties
5,27-09-2017,studying with open colleges,highly recommend studying with open colleges everyone from trainers assessors and support staff go out of their way to help you understand the course material help with assessments and motivate and set goals to complete your course there is also great support from fellow students in the forums and options for study buddies so convenient when you can't commit to going to a regular class everyday you can study in your own time
4,27-09-2017,open colleges was a great way to study,open colleges was a great way to study for me i was able to study when it suited me i was also able to volunteer and get experience in my chosen field while i was studying
5,26-09-2017,i have completed my cert lll in education support,i have completed my cert lll in education support studying for the first time in years was hard but i found that i had support from open colleges to complete my course in due time i would recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to get back into the work force after being a parent at home or just a change in direction really worthwhile
3,26-09-2017,just a waste of money,open colleges is a well recognised training institution although i've seen a big dropped down in the student support and management since the ownership of the oc has changed it seems to me like now oc is trying to get more students  but do not care about the individuals and how they go with their studies once they are enrolled if you write to your trainers they replay back to you after  days when you could have really progress with your assessments in that time instead of waiting for the message back most of the times when i asked a question i wasn't getting the straight answer  the answers were more like my questions just written differently and not clear for me at all also when you submit the assessment the next module should be opened automatically not that you have to write to your coordinator and wait  days till it's gonna be unlocked or calling the oc support and spend  min on the linetime is crucial for everyone those days the assessments itself have lots of mistakes and spelling errors sometimes you don't even know what are they askingwhat they want form you to completed feedback's from the assessors look more like a copy  paste  spreadsheet than a feedback to understand the mistakes you've done in the assessment also they are not consistent  one of the assessor gives you a hd for your written report then the other one only d as an executive summery was missing in your report it was missing in the first  that i submitted as well and no one even commented on it the amount of emails not addressed to memy study about opening new units expiry of the course or changes to study structure was just insane same when you call the student support  one person says a the other one says b and at the end you are soo confused and have to write an email to them anyway and again wait another  days to get the answeroverall my experience with open colleges is below average i'm happy that i finished it and that i don't have to deal with it anymore
4,26-09-2017,pretty good i ran into hardly problems,pretty good i ran into hardly problems and friends i have recommended like them too
1,26-09-2017,i would not recommend open colleges to,i would not recommend open colleges to anyonefrom the little support you receive to modules taking months to be marked overall an absolutely appalling experience
4,26-09-2017,i enjoyed my study experience with open,i enjoyed my study experience with open colleges the staff at open colleges are very helpful and do their best to ensure student completion of the course if there is anything that i could point out  would be the response time to questions asked to trainers on open space  it would be great to see a quicker responseoverall i appreciate the support and cooperation and would happily recommend open colleges to anyone who is looking to start a new career or build their career and receive a professional qualification
4,25-09-2017,i found the experience great as long as,i found the experience great as long as you left enough time in your work life schedule to finish subjects successfully as if you had a question you have to allow enough time for your answer   enjoyed it overall
1,25-09-2017,assignments take weeks to be marked,assignments take weeks to be marked i was left waiting for a long time on many occasions which impacted my studies and my ability to move forward in the course so bad do not enroll with open colleges
4,25-09-2017,open colleges was great for me being a,open colleges was great for me being a mum of  kids and always busy  i was able to find the time to complete my course i got quite sick and was able to defer for  months with no hesitations from open collegesi am quite impatient so waiting  days for assessments to be marked or for questions to be answered  was difficult the course content constantly gets updated which is great however no extra time is added when more assessments are added i also had great assssors and made a life long friend from a study buddy
2,25-09-2017,review,at the start of my year course the support was terrible i would message an open collges trainer a question about the assessment i was doing and they would sometimes take up to a week to respond when time is crucial thats a long time to leave a student hanging the support did get better and more frequent  in the last year or so of doing my certificatethe marking did take quite a whilewouldnt study through opencolleges again and i wouldnt recomend to anyone wanting to study
4,23-09-2017,loved studying with open colleges,loved studying with open colleges only thing that could be improved is the time it takes for assessments to get graded  great format knowledgeable content would now like to get  employment in my chosen field
5,23-09-2017,great experience with open colleges,loved studying with open colleges  had great support from the beginning and it was easy to download the topics and study  finished the course in less time than expected and enjoyed the experience
2,23-09-2017,very disappointing overall,very disappointing overall only two people in the whole organisation made an effort one person in student support who helped get my rpl through even though i had been contacting support for help for  months and my assessor paolo who helped greatly i had to extend and pay for an extra  months because of wrong information and a dreadful lack of general support and communication the assessments were very difficult to upload and took a long time to get marked which then delayed the next modules start i  am not a good witness in referring this organisation just by the stress people have witnessed in me getting this course done
4,23-09-2017,open colleges  awesome,great college and excellent student support

4,22-09-2017,pretty decent,for the most part it was pretty decent feedback from trainers was helpful in this case even more so because feedback is very important in anything design related i did a design course the website could use a bit of work in terms of navigation having to go back to the main course page just to see your other assessments is a bit of a hassle over time i got used to it although the course i did was a small one it was pretty informative and did give me a basic insight into what it would be like in the industry support services over the phone were pretty amazing as well shoutout to mr matral enrollment consultant david from support services and the trainers
5,22-09-2017,thanks open colleges,i have just completed my cert  in childhood education with open colleges and would highly recommend them i am an older student so studying was not an easy thing to deal with especially with  kids and having not a lot of computer experience  open colleges have been great very supportive and understanding offering very useful advice and help when needed quick to respond to emails and messages a great college that want you to succeed and are there every step of the way thanks to open colleges i am now employed as a teachers aide and loving it couldn't have done it without the support of the college
4,21-09-2017,great course,was good the website got a lot better over the  years that i was studying  the webinars were great trainers were always helpful
5,21-09-2017,dear all,dear allam really very happy to choose the open collegesstudy material  every thing is good and sufficientevery one is very friendly and specially assessors are very supported people am thank full to them for their feed backs suggestions and their assistance in each and every aspectonce againthank you very much to all
1,21-09-2017,a disappointing disorganised experience,overall i was not pleased with my open colleges experience the learning resources were outdated there were spelling errors and the assessments were often quite unrelated to the learning tasks as an educator myself i am aware that assessments are an extension of learning however in this case i found myself having to google the majority of my answers as the learning materials did not cover it you should not be tested on material that you know nothing about  that is not the purpose of assessmentsi also spoke to quite a rude person for my follow up question call this was at the start of the course when i was excited and ready to get started the person i talked to was disinterested and distracted and i felt as though i was a burden for him it was very disappointingfinding a placement was very difficult i was living in sydney at the time which you would think has hundreds of options no no one would take students i felt like i had paid a lot of money and open colleges was not helping their process for helping you find a placement was more difficult than finding a placement yourself they did not make it easy to seek help i felt like i handed over  upfront and received outdated online materials and no help to get placementi also found the processes of this course quite arduous and disorganised  especially the placement phone interview the phone interview was supposed to take place half way through my placement when the knowledge is fresh in your mind however due to whatever disorganised reason mine did not happen until months later to make things worse my interview was scheduled for pm one afternoon and i waited by my phone for an hour and received no call i then emailed my interviewer to find out she must not have put it in her diary or there was some kind of glitchadditonally on this phone call i was informed that i had completed all necessary components and i could await my certificate i waited a few months and heard nothing so i called open colleges apparently i hadn't submitted my logbook i meticulously followed the uploading instructions for the assignment and according to their instructions i had completed everything why is there nothing in place that alerts you that there is a necessary component missing from your assignment what would have happened if i didn't call to check on the whereabouts of my certificate would my course time frame have run out and then been deemed incomplete and unsuccessfulfor a college that prides themselves on being the best i am not impressed i will not be recommending open colleges to others to anyone reading this find an alternate college
5,21-09-2017,course work was well presented and easy,course work was well presented and easy to followstudent support staff were very friendly and always very helpful with any queries i may have had
5,20-09-2017,the trainers and support are great,the trainers are great and you receive the best support they really want you to reach and achieve your goals i have done a few courses now with open colleges and would recommend anyone looking for great support and education
2,19-09-2017,very poor,very poor to much is relied on one book disappointed over all took to long to have a question answered not a lot was even really revalent  to the realword of being a teacher aide would not recommended at all very annoyed overall
5,19-09-2017,tutors and staff were amazing,tutors and staff were amazing the course was good and informativei enjoyed it allthe new zealand support side is not good at getting back and giving information if they answered the phone at all how ever when i rung the australian side they were really good and helpful when ever and gave good support i am happy i chose to study with you
5,19-09-2017,open college,i have done this course to better my myob knowledge and to have a proper certificate  i have been using myob in my husband business with little training for yearsi had a fantastic and easy learning experience and i would definitely consider more in my near future
1,19-09-2017,would not recommend them chose a better,would not recommend them chose a better provider they give you the run around and  then make out like it is your fault and then the trainers assume things like copping work from someone else and if you did not because you have a study buddy thing change you get blamed for plagiarism don't go through them
1,19-09-2017,dodgy,editthe response shown from open colleges below falsley states that they have resolved the issues through special considerations this is untrue as i have not applied for a remedy under special considerations and no resolve has been made for my consumer law breach complaints the remedy open colleges offers is that i have been constantly pursuaded to keep the course i have paid for that i am trying to cancel and refund through consumer protection laws the response below is yet another example of deception from open collegeschoose a better quality course provider  i am having to go through so much hassle trying to cancel and be refunded due to ongoing and multiple admin errors service failures and to be honest low quality course contentdefinitely take into considerationpushy sales people using pursuasion techniques and even calling multiple times to seek to enroll you asapmultiple spelling errors and inconsistencies in courseembarrassingly dodgy youtube videos used to deliver learning contentquiz errorscourse changes that mean you need to start over without gaining academic credit for work completed because courses are not up to scratch to government regulationsunreasonable and scammy contractsunwillingness to adhere to consumer law and follow their own policy and procedureunethical immoral and moneyhungry definitely prioritising profit over student learningi really want people to learn that although there are some reviews of open colleges being decent they are a forprofit company that have lost most legitimacy from major flaws and errors dodgy operations  low quality content and even predatory sales techniques and the inability to rectify issues their main concern is to lock you into a contract if you want to be taken seriously in your career  choose somone else
5,18-09-2017,my experience with open colleges has,my experience with open colleges has been nothing but terrifici managed to complete my  year course in  monthssupport was always available
5,17-09-2017,hard work but well worth it,hard work but well worth it open colleges open space is easy to navigate and follow the course is comprehensive and challenging the tutors could reply quicker but when they do they give good honest feedback and assistance i would definitely study again with open colleges
3,17-09-2017,feedback and review open colleges and vet nursing,the only negative feedback i have about open colleges is there's no standardised marking between assessors and it problems take days to resolve otherwise my overall experience was good finding placement for vet nursing was a nightmare so if you're studying vet nursing be aware of this to improve i think there should be a student body of some sort to advocate for students if there is already one in place can you make it easy to find
4,17-09-2017,overall i found the course very good,overall i found the course very good and i learnt new skills the tutors were helpful and going through the assessments helped bring it all together some of the course content could do with updating in that links were broken for extra reading etc overall good though
5,17-09-2017,my experience doing my diploma with,my experience doing my diploma with open colleges has been a very positive one the support from the teachers and student service has been awesome and i would recommend this company to anyone without any reservation
5,16-09-2017,made going back to study painless,always helpful staff and made everything easy
5,16-09-2017,my review,i would say that open college has been a very open and approachable experience for me while studying i found that the units and the assignments were very focused on what i was wanting to study and the feedback was always timely and informative placement was very rewarding as i did mine in fiji and was able to put skills into practice in a very meaningful and rewarding manner i would like to thank all my trainer livingston and all those who assessed my work as well as rosan and travis for the training and invaluable feedback during my time overall it was a great experience
5,16-09-2017,thanks to the great trainers at open,thanks to the great trainers at open colleges they have made my course so easy i would really recommend open colleges
5,15-09-2017,open colleges was my first foray into,open colleges was my first foray into the world of online learning and it's been a great experience the course content is clear well presented and the interface works well where open colleges have really excelled is communication emails are replied to quickly and efficiently and assessments are thoroughly graded and review is clearly explained highly recommend
3,15-09-2017,very long and repetitive,course material was good and thoroughassessments were way too long and repetitivefeedback from assessments was sometimes just a copy and paste and very general and not relevant to my assessment l had worked so hard onfor a certificate the length of the course including all the assessments the portfolio was just ridiculous and more work than my bachelor degrees that l havethe website didnt show an accurate reflection of the percentage of my completed course which was disheartening the website was often slow to respond slow to open
5,15-09-2017,loved my time,loved my timethe time i spent doing my course was made easy and understandable the trainers were always quick to help me with any problems i came across even when i had to take some time off because of my health the staff made it easy for me to jump right back into my studiesi would defiantly recommend open colleges to a friend i actually already have i also know that i will be continuing more studies with open colleges
3,15-09-2017,well planned course with some issues,well planned course issues involved the reading material with errors in regards to missing references and some scanned in material was unreadable query's on the scanned material were left unaddressed history reading material would be more beneficial if delivered electronically via video link or dvd overall course was good but took much longer than expected to complete assignments unsure if i would further my studies using an online platform
5,14-09-2017,i found the support great,i found the support great my messages were always replied to quickly and clearly regarding the assessments it was perfect being able to study at my own pace and complete the course as it fitted my lifestyle
5,14-09-2017,i was very happy with the way i was,i was very happy with the way i was helped and any questions were explained very well i had help from everyone that was invovled in my couse
4,14-09-2017,even though the course material was,even though the course material was interesting to read found the reading material had at times incorrect grammar and spelling mistakes throughout the whole coursethe student placement was a little over whelming as too much information at one time maybe one section at a time as there is a lot of work to dothe interview questions throughout the placement was helpful as there was time to ask questions and generally talk about any concerns during this time it was nice to finally hear a voice at the other end of the phone as not much communication during the course and had to wait up to  days for a reply from an assessorim a first time student on line so was a bit of a learning experience and felt a bit lost sometimesoverall i enjoyed studying and am glad it have done it as i'm employed in the allied health field alreadythanks
1,13-09-2017,when i first enrolled in my cert,when i first enrolled in my cert aged care i was told i would get rpl credit for the  out of the  units i had already studied with tafe qld however when i sent in the evidence i was told that the course had now changed to cert  in individual support and i would not get any credit for the units i had completed they offered to reslove the issue and i requested financial credit that i would have received for the units i had completed i received under  not happy i considered withdrawing but knew i would not get my money back as i had paid up front in full expecting the credit to be returnedwhen i started my placement i had sent the forms on to the placement organisation and thought i had done all necessary steps so began my placement when i submitted my first assignment  i was told that my placement had not been authorized this created a lot of stress for me as i was half way through the placement and was told i would have to start again the college did allow me to continue the placement once and i did not have to repeat iti submitted an assignment in may and it was marked satisfactory in may in july the same assignment was marked as being submitted incorrectly apparently they changed the way the assignments were to be submitted in june after the assignment was submitted an assignment submitted on  july was finally marked on  augustthe college was always very slow to return calls and often had to be called again to get a result i found the whole experience stressful and at time wondered if i would ever get my certificatewould not recommend open colleges to anyone
1,12-09-2017,open colleges where do i begin,open colleges where do i beginnot happy with service feedback or communicationi have been studying  course with open colleges and was happy with the very easy to use online learning platformso decided to apply for  more course that i started at a local tafe to finish through open collegeson one of my courses i apply for rpl i was told by  days i would have it back to me with an answer so after  i called them and their had been a delay in process iti've now had to wait over  months with no one contacting me or getting back to me and i'm always the one to ring them yet nothing is updated on my filei feel very let down but and with to cancel and with draw from coursesand find a new place to studyi hope other students don't make the same mistake and study through open colleges
3,12-09-2017,my open college experience,enrollment was an easy process and the payment plan option worked well for me i give my  stars based on the course content which is excellent and in depth although the assessments were sometimes difficult to understand due to questions that made no sense or criteria that wasn't listed at times i felt as though it was set up that way to make me struggle some assessors were very helpful and for that i am thankful others were not so helpful the workplace learning was lengthy and a very stressful experience for me at times i felt like i had to jump through a lot of unnecessary hoops i would recommend starting work placement at the beginning of the course because there is a lot of waiting for interview appointments and assessments to be marked unfortunately i would not recommend anyone studying with open colleges i am thankful and proud to have completed my course now with little support but i will never study through them again
5,12-09-2017,my expectations were met,easy enrolment process great support available both through the online forums and contact with tutors timely responses and marking and easy navigation on the website practical element also helped with realistic career options thank you open colleges

3,10-09-2017,it's a great option to have online,it's a great option to have online courses so that you can continue to work comfortably while studying for me though i felt like i had to wait too long to get responses from my assessor'strainers for assistance with my assessments i also felt that during my elective the webinar's where very poor not enough examples where given and it felt like i was being read my assessment questions when receiving feedback from completed assessments a lot of the time i didn't understand what they were asking of me that i could of done better overall i completed my course and it had it's ups and downs open colleges is a great idea for people like me it just lacked communication
4,09-09-2017,good option for avert iv tae,course materials were supplied and tutorials were viewable online the assessment submission process was easy to follow the trainers were available to answer questions via messaging services their responses were typically detailed and reflective in nature taking into account your question and providing examples in an attempt to answerthe only negative i found was regular typographical and grammatical errors in some of the units of competency workbooks and sample rto case studies
4,09-09-2017,open colleges provides a great online,open colleges provides a great online study experience to me trainers are kind and helpful
2,08-09-2017,do research before committing yourself to open colleges,first is my fault  found out i paid  too much for my course through open colleges could have paid  and recieved the same certificate with better support do research second  the learning material is very poorly written which makes it difficult to understand third  the trainers are very slow in responding fourth  when i completed my studies it took two weeks to recieve an email saying 'happy graduation' thanks but no thanks to you

5,07-09-2017,amazing time,i found the course challenging but rewarding the support you receive from fellow students and trainers was amazing i loved receiving my results back with my assessment attached showing me my errors so i could learn from them the feedback was so uplifting that i forgot at times i was at school completion time for the course was more than enough time i guess best way to describe it is you get out what you put in to the course
5,07-09-2017,amazing support team,amazing support teami cannot fault the support services open colleges offers any call i made was prioritised and listened to by very friendly people i have a very high opinion of themthe open colleges site was easy to navigate and had a lot of informationall up it was an experience i am grateful for

5,05-09-2017,excellent system great courses and lovely people,excellent system and great courses open space is full of incredibly useful learning resources and everyone working for open colleges in my experience whether they be assessors teachers or working in student support have all been really lovely and very helpful they will go out of their way to help and ensure you get the most out of your course

5,30-08-2017,great service from the staff,great service from the staff  easy to follow course guide  highly recommend open colleges  professional at all times
5,30-08-2017,fantastic experience,fantastic experience the only piece of criticism i have is if the trainersassessors could be more responsive with answering questions and messageslearning material was structured great and easy to follow assessments were easy to follow and relevant to current environments in the workplacestudent support was great and one of the biggest lessons i learnt was from thembig thanks to open collegesyou helped me find my awesomeandrew
2,29-08-2017,a lot of room for improvement,the course was interesting and i learnt a little but the course material has obviously never been proofread it contains factual errors contradictory information outofdate information and poor grammarthere were times when the tutors did not respond in a timely mannerthe online information was sometimes missing and it was not easy to find information on the sitethe technical staff were however usually brilliantonly do this course if you really need it there must surely be better courses out there
4,29-08-2017,great course,the course was useful and comprehensive the assignments were assessed by different people all competent and helpful i did learn a lot and enjoyed the coursesome small details and discrepancies in some of the assignments especially the earlier tasks  could be improvedoverall i would definitely recommend this course
5,28-08-2017,great,it has been a great experience studying with open colleges they are very helpful the course material is detailed
5,28-08-2017,my journey,like anyone one i experienced personal challenges whilst undertaking my studies fortunately although a demanding course open colleges couldn't be more accommodating to me when the going got tough now that i have secured work in a beautiful preschool in open colleges defense i realize now the importance of the study content thank you to the team of open colleges for your ongoing support and guidance from day  right through to the conclusion of my diploma i feel well educated and feel you are indeed reputable whilst remaining accountable cheers and keep up the excellent workfran pappalardo
5,27-08-2017,an excellent trainer helped me get,an excellent trainer helped me get through the tough stuff
2,27-08-2017,glad its over,trainers were helpful however mistakes in course material material that did not adequately prepare for assessments and assessments being poorley worded created a frustrating learning  experience feedback on assessments was often lacking simplistic  not constructive to further learning the bas component should have had webinars to explain this area more fully this was by far the worse area of study in terms of preparation for the assessment and learning how to analyze reports to recognizerectify errors trainers did their best to get me through but alot of questions remain unanswered unexplainedthe course material and assessments seem designed to prolong the ability to acheive completion in the time framei acheived great results but i have some experience i would not recommend this course to any newcomers to bookkeeping especiallynor others looking to gain this qualification this is not an area of study conducive to online learning
3,27-08-2017,communication and support,i found the lack of communication with any trainers unless a question was asked was a bit of a problem if it was a face to face course the tutor would be having constant contact with the students i would get into a rut and there was no support from anyone just left on my own perhaps a fortnightly contact with students could be implemented to keep students interested and supported  suggestions from tutors if students are having problems to get motivated again i found the need to photograph family a big issue as i don't have family nearby many people particularly older people don't have family available to photographythe interviews in each section i found the background very distracting nothing to do with a photography course the interviews in the early sections taken in an office  with the completely blown out distracting background was not a good  advertisement of how to take indoor photos always check the background is what is being taught but the tutors are not following that 'rule'module  seems to be the level most people are getting stuck on perhaps a review of this section to make it more interesting would keep students interested in the subjectwith lots of visual voice communications available now this could be a form of communication and support for studentspintrest needs to be divided into smaller boards one for the current students to post to not with thousand of images displayed and not being able to follow or find your images on the board
4,27-08-2017,overall,overall open colleges were great there were a couple of inconsistencies in regards to the wording of some modules some areas did not make a whole lot of sense due to how they were worded however i was able to jump on google and research the matter as a back uphaving said that the assessors were always available to help and thankyou very much to open collegesryan
5,27-08-2017,i found open colleges a really good,i found open colleges a really good online college with one of the best student support teamsthe trainers are so enagaged and are always doing their best to help and guide you through the course

4,26-08-2017,diploma of accounting,dear ruchias i have finally received confirmation from admissions that i have finished my course i would like to thank you immensely for all your guidance assistance support and encouragement along the wayby no means has the past two and a half years been easy for me personally let alone in trying to complete my diploma as well without your constant contact it would not have been possible you are truly a great asset to open colleges and i hope they reward you appropriatelyto say i am on cloud nine is an understatement i am so ecstatic that i have finally graduated and cannot wait to receive my certificate it will take a few weeks to unwind from the ongoing stress i am sure but i am so looking forward to a relaxed life once moreplease accept a huge thank you from me for helping me to achieve the first item on my bucket list i wish and your new family well in the futureps i am almost sorry to have finished as i feel a hole in my life but i am sure it will be filled by something equally challenging soon
5,25-08-2017,i had a great experience,i had a great experience using open colleges for distance education the trainers were always there to help assist me if i needed help their comments with my grads were helpful and so was the portal that i found easy to navigate through i have already recommended people to join open colleges if they want to try distance education  stars from mealicia bandera
5,25-08-2017,best online experience,best online experience if i required help throughout everyone was always friendly amd happy to help messages replied to within the said time frame loved it thank you so much for helping me improve my knowledge and go further in my career
3,25-08-2017,a bumpy ride but great problem solving,i transferred to open colleges from another college i wish i could say that the transition went smoothly but i had to take initiative for every step on the way i also had to complain several times because i was getting mixed messages from different staff members i was very confused about the requirements and i kept getting wrong information the transfer might have played a huge role here so i can't really say what kind of experience i would have had had i started with open colleges in the first placehowever i was impressed by the promptness of their response and by the fact that every issue that came up was dealt with very quickly i would probably choose this college again if i wanted to continue studying but i would be prepared to take more initiative and ask for clarification more frequently and possibly ask more staff members the same question to be sure that the information that i was getting was correct
4,25-08-2017,great flexibility,great flexibilityit was great to be able to complete my course at my own pace in my own home this made it so easy to work around kids work and other commitments the student interface is also easy to use and i found i got quite a lot of support from the fact that other students were asking similar questions on the forum
5,25-08-2017,i found the course with open colleges,i found the course with open colleges very informative and helpful i decided i needed a career change and found the tutors trainers and assessors all very helpful they were there when i needed guidance or support and i would certainly recommend them to friends and colleagues looking at doing an online course
4,24-08-2017,a good mix of coursework and practicals,a good mix of coursework and practicals through the modules and work placement  there is support available  its online so you don't get to meet classmates and the study buddy didn't work for me but overall a very enjoyable course and would recommend open colleges
4,24-08-2017,open colleges,i finished my course very early but when i had a two week break cause of work or holidays  i had numerous emails and phone calls about not falling behind and i felt a little harassed  tutors well helpful and majority of assessment was marked within the  days  not sure how you award a grade for certificate course kind of goes against the competent or not yet competent  overall i was happy with my course
5,24-08-2017,very easy to study with the download,very easy to study with the download pdf version  which i used alotvery easy responses from tutors and the assessors
5,23-08-2017,the courses are easy to understand,the courses are easy to understand follow access and everything is accessible online which is great your able to do the course at your own pace and able to see which assessments you still have to do
5,22-08-2017,the help i received was marvellous and,the help i received was marvellous and easy to follow and understandable the course was amazing and i enjoyed it
1,22-08-2017,do not use them for your studies,do not use them for your studies  i have contacted them multiple times asking for a form to be sent to me so i can request for an extension as i have had a baby i asked for the extention  months before my due date my baby is now  months old every  weeks i call or email them and each time the staff have said they will send me the form they never have also you need to keep paying them during this time period they don't stop payments they just give you an extra  months on your finish date that's if you can even apply for the extension as their service is horrid
5,22-08-2017,i found the course exceeded my expectations,i found the course though challenging easy to complete due to the flexibility of the way it is offeredi have benefited from the course
5,21-08-2017,open colleges is a great way to learn,open colleges made everything very accessible and easy to understand and follow  which made following the course and completing it within time frames much easier
2,21-08-2017,better off through tafe very unsupportive and money hungry,from the get go the salesman on the phone put pressure on me to sign up immediately for  certificates i only was interested in  the cooling off period was much too short and locked you into a contract i would've gotten out of had i known how difficult and unsupportive my experience was going to be it took about a month to get my workplacement approved wasting my time and took a long time  month between assessments to get marked for workplace portfolio and logbook and then final phone interview to completing responses from staff were sometimes a week or more apart and had to be chased up i am not looking forward to my next cert based on this experience and am unfortunately locked into their contract for it otherwise i would go through tafethey are quick to chase you on payments though so you can see the priority for them a student i did placement with had further money taken out of her account each time they attempted to take money out even though she called them and told them to wait until the next day to take the money outfelt very hindered in my study and unsupported
5,21-08-2017,bas agent's study,i took longer than i generally would to complete my course due to work and other study commitments but throughout the course i received nothing but gentle encouragement without judgment to get me to my final goalmy best experience was with my trainer kim she was supportive and her guidance was invaluable she was very prompt with her replies to my queries and always provided me with very clear guidelines and suitable feedbackthank you open space and thank you kim
4,21-08-2017,open colleges were great,open colleges were great of i asked for help i go it i just found i had a lot more help at the start of the course initially someone would check on randomly and see how things were going and if i was on track the motivation i needed this soon stopped and i feel i would have benefited more from occassional how r u going email or phone call
5,21-08-2017,i have had a wonderful experience with,i have had a wonderful experience with ope collegethe trainers are very good and always willing to helpall their staff are fantasticwould recommend to anyone who wants to do any course good trainingi have already got job in a school
4,20-08-2017,i found this course fantastic,i found this course fantasticthe only improvement i could mention is that i work full time and chose open colleges for their distance learning option therefore i study and complete my assessments on weekends if i got stuck and needed to email a teacher i would have to wait until the monday or tuesday for a response therefor holding me up until the following weekend
5,19-08-2017,open colleges has made studying easy,open colleges has made studying easytheir course materials are easy to understand and outlined everything i needed to know assessment work supported what was learnt during the modulethe tutors were always willing to assist in answering any questions i hadi can't recommend open colleges enough
2,19-08-2017,the graphic design pathway program,the online portal has been down has caused problems and some issues have not been taken seriously when reportedthe pathway program for graphic design consists of pointing students at the internet and telling them to learn the software themselves using publicly available videos and online tutorials you don't need to sign up and pay up to  for that hoping it gets better and some actual teaching occurs as i've only been enrolled for a month on the plus side assessors have responded quickly and student support are always available
2,18-08-2017,improvement,hii can understand the course is very new to the market i don't believe the course was looked into before publication due to the many mistakes and level of inconsistenciesthroughout certain stages of the course you are dealing with different trainers i personally think this is a flaw i found the different trainers had different levels of assistance one trainer in particular wasn't very helpful she was but wasn'tas far as customer service goes it would be nice to talk to a trainer and not have to wait a couple of hours for feedback i also think the  day policy for feedback is appaulling as well although i do understand the trainers are busyoverall the course through oc was very stressing i loved the course itself but having to deal with oc was terrible yes the course needs improvement
4,17-08-2017,overall a great experience,overall a great experience only problem was when changing from a format modules to b format modules it all became a bit messy with what was to be emailed and in which format ie pdf  wordsupport from the trainers  assessors was fantastic and very encouraging every step of the months i took to study my course
4,15-08-2017,my experience with open colleges has,my experience with open colleges has been a positive one i have gained more confidence in my own abilities and was able to find employment in my chosen field of study
1,15-08-2017,rubbish,the materials contained unspeakable amounts of errors missing information incorrect information and often didnt make sense the online student portal was inaccessible for days at a time one particular trainer seemed more interested in what her personal life than helping out students and was often unable to answer questions in an intelligent way there was no evidence of 'industry experts' and the whole thing was a shambles from beginning to end oc seemed more interested in making sure students opions were quashed than apologising and sorting out problems honourably
3,14-08-2017,not too bad but not great either,i haven't had the best experience studying with open colleges some of the assessors and trainers take forever to reply to messages which isn't good enough when i've needed help with my work apart from that the content is easy to read and understand and the fact that i was able to extend my course was a big help for me probably won't study with open colleges again
3,14-08-2017,hello,hellomy friction is not with the trainers  some trainers are excellent with the feedback very detailed and easy to understand generally they are quick to respond toomy friction is with the admin side  i have just today completed all required units for my double certificate course and my opening page says i still have  assessments to complete  i have been fighting for this to be corrected for a year and a half  it is very unmotivating i have also had to fight for recognition of units completed  when the course changed i was told i had not completed two units when i had  i have email confirmations to confirm my completion but nothing ever changes on my page  i have sent a message today to ask for confirmation that both courses are done as i won't rest easy until i have that proof
1,14-08-2017,terrible experiance,i started a course allied health assistant course in occupational therapy in january  i first experience was actually very good the people were nice and when i was calling up to ask for the enrollment the lady on the phone told me that the course is discounted of course i thought that this is a great opportunity and i enrolled myself in the course i was very luck and fortunate that i could study full time for about  month and i went quickly though to the course but in the beginning of may i received an email saying that the course i am currently doing will be changed and that everything i have done all of my assessments and time i invested will be not recognized these are government changes and open colleges is very sorry about the inconvenienceafter a couple of phone calls tears and frustration i had to start the course from zero again my motivation was very low and it was hard for me to start again however i picked up my mojo towards the end of the year and was completing the course within a few month i have to say that the current course is better structured and easier than the old course however for the course i also had to complete an internship to complete this course i was looking for an internship since january  and had contacted around  different organisation but no one wanted to take an student from open collages on most are just taking uni students i was calling several time open collages and was asking for help finding a place but it took them until april this year to actually get in touch with me to help me finding a work placement that meant for me that i was stuck with a  finished course for over  month and no one from open colleges was interested in helping me i felt very sad about the treatment from open colleges and would personally never do a course with them againit is now august and i finally finished my course i couldn't be more happier that this nightmare of studies is over and i can continue having a normal live with out open collagesi also want to mention that my work placement assessor was very supportive lovely and nice i am very glad that she guided me though the work placement thank you
1,14-08-2017,read all information from a book and,read all information from a book and when i went for work experience no instructions on falls and lifting resident fell on top of me and i was injured unsupervised no ohs training within the workplace and funnily no documentation about the incident open colleges' workplace coordinator told me that she did not want to hear from me until after the placement had ended where was the support so desperately required felt so inadequate and unprepared for work experience and it was a toxic environment so zero support all round
3,14-08-2017,certificate iv in professional writing and editing,i felt that the professional writing and editing course could have contained more practice in editing and proofreading  maybe been  given pieces of writing to edit and proofread as someone who was coming to this course with a view to learning more about professional ie workplace documentation i felt that the course focussed more on writing for social media that in itself is fine if that's where you are aiming but it possibly should have been more apparent in the blurb about the course there were some issues with communication with tutors at one stage an email enquiry was not answered and only by chasing it up with another tutor was i advised that the first tutor no longer worked with open colleges overall i did learn a few things but i don't feel that it was great value for the money spent by my employer
5,14-08-2017,well organised course,well organised course many availablereliable helpsupport and accommodating staff particularly the trainersassessors
5,13-08-2017,perfect service always available to,perfect service always available to help when you need it
4,13-08-2017,flexbility to study from home was great,loved being able to study from the comfort of home and at my own pace open colleges had decent assignments and scenario's to work through and the trainer's and assessors were very receptive and helpful to any questions i had throughout my course
5,10-08-2017,i've had no problem recommending open,i've had no problem recommending open colleges as i have been treated with the professionalism that your company provides thank you
4,10-08-2017,i love being able to do all the study,i love being able to do all the study at my own pace although at times it was hard to get motivated i got there in the end the only issue was sometimes the questions for the assignments were a bit hard to understand and would have to re do but after reading the student disscusions i realised i wasn't the only one this was only minor because i got to redo the question anyway thoroughly enjoyed it otherwise heres to the rest of my life thank you open colleges for this opportunity
3,10-08-2017,i personally would not choose to a,i personally would not choose to a course by correspondence againwhilst the trainersassessors were helpful when asked the support is actually limited you can call student support but all they really do is give you deadlines the websiteopenspace is shocking there is always something wrong a section is not accessible or a section is down making it very hard to actually get on with things at times
4,09-08-2017,i am studying cert  vet nursing and so,i am studying cert  vet nursing and so far through the whole course open colleges has been amazing with support and timely feedback they have been a huge help whenever i need it
5,09-08-2017,i got lots of practical and theoretical,i got lots of practical and theoretical experience from my course when i doing my course i thought it is too much work compare with other centers but finally i understood all these help to better understanding of theory and practical application now i all of these knowledge use in my work place
2,09-08-2017,lack of support and care,lack of support and caresadly i wouldn't recommend studying with open colleges i found that the staff lacked the necessary support required for an online course on numerous occasions i have contacted student support and been told they will get back to me however it has taken a week or more and many follow up phone calls on my endi didn't find the trainers overly helpful one enquiry took me over  months to follow up and even then i didn't get an appropriate answer that's over  months of waiting to get assistance with an assessment and you can't move on to the next unit until you complete the previous assessmentoverall a very stressful experience i thought it would be fantastic given the flexibility but really that is the only bonus wouldn't recommend studying through open colleges
5,09-08-2017,amazing learning,i loved all the aspects of working with open college the staff are helpful when you need help my exprience with you was amazing it was worth the price i paid and would recommend anyone to learn with youthank you
4,09-08-2017,a great online provider,great platform but doesn't allow access occasionally online is great in terms of convenience but downside is you need a lot of self discipline i found that the caliber of assessor plays a major role in this lindsay was great prompt in responding detailed answers and answered my questioni would have liked to of seen other methods to learn for example i love flash cards these would help me to remember definitions ect to a deeper level than what i currently have even a 'cheat sheet' a page with a summary of each topic i can keep in my bag and look over this stuff especially would be handy right now as i'm applying for jobs and freaking out about interviews these could be included in the additional resources
3,08-08-2017,i felt like there was alot of mucking,i felt like there was alot of mucking round and not alot of communication hard to get hold of assesors when needed
4,08-08-2017,overall good experience,the course material was easy to comprehend and relevant the workload and assessments were appropriate only complaint it was an inconvience to have to call student support to get the next module unlocked every time
3,07-08-2017,certificate iv bookkeeping,i honestly thought that the experience of online learning would prove a lot better than what opencolleges provided i struggled a lot with the many mistakes in my learning materials and assessments the confusion and glitches on the website and while my assessors and trainers were happy to reply to my inquiries i never really got a direct answer and that left a lot of students myself included ready to quit with frustrationhaving said that however i have learned a lot and i think that even though it has been a struggle for the past  years it's still been worth it learning perseverance in getting through difficult issues and understanding more of what is required when i get stuff wrong and learning to ask the right question to get the answer i needbut i am sorry to say that i will not be highly recommending opencolleges to anyone who would want to professionally study a course in bookkeeping
3,06-08-2017,assessments ambiguous and poorly formatted,some assessments were ambiguous even the trainer acknowledged this difficult to know what the trainer was looking for at timessome trainers very helpful and course coordinator but others not so much some good online support materials to guide progress throughout study periods
4,06-08-2017,my review,if you have an interest in drawing or anything that might involve drawing i recommend this course its very informative and educational
4,05-08-2017,an easy to follow course,my course was very easy to work through on my own i needed very little to no help as the webinars we're extremely helpful i had a couple of technical difficulties which is a given when completing an entire course online the staff were all amazing and very helpful
4,05-08-2017,i found the coursework very easy to,i found the coursework very easy to follow with a wide range of academic content from many informed people for the price it was very helpful for my writing and the feedback from rob stephenson my trainer was incredibly encouraging he genuinely cared about my career as a writer outside of the course oftentimes including extra information packages from outside the curriculum for me to study alongside my assessment noteswill definitely recommend open colleges to friends and keep it in mind for future studies
4,04-08-2017,good choice for independent and selfsufficient learners,if you are an independent and selfsufficient learner like i am you will enjoy studying with oc i completed cert iv in hr and i did it within  year instead of given  months as a professional who works fulltime has family commitments and other community responsibilities i found it extremely convenient to be able to download study material and assignments to study while on a train all my assignment were graded within a promised time frame of  days it was a bit inconvenient not to get notifications once an assignment grade is received and i had to download feedbacks to be able to read them also student engagement facilitation can be improved for students who may like to get some motivation from outside it was good though that our trainer set up a fb page where they regularly post relevant updates on the industryoverall it was a decent experience and i do recommend to study with oc if you are a person with good organisational time planning and investigationsearch skills but if you are the one who needs inclass learning under a constant trainer's eye then sorry you should shop somewhere else
4,04-08-2017,happy graduater,content was good informative and up to dateresponses to questions on openspace wasn't great  sometimes assignments were marked fast others not so  overall loved the course
4,03-08-2017,cet ii in information digital media and technology,staff were friendly and answered questions in a timely fashion although not always clearlythe lesson notes issued for my course in it were out of date and had many links that either didn't work or the websites no longer operated the notes need to be reviewed and updated urgentlyall assessment tasks were marked within the  day period guaranteed at the outset
5,03-08-2017,very helpful assessors who return,very helpful assessors who return assessments very promptly sometimes even the following day always encouraging and helpful with feedback i always received excellent assessment helps with useful advicewebsite easy to navigatestudent support always willing to help when needed
2,03-08-2017,if i had any hindsight i would not have,if i had any hindsight i would not have signed up for this course definitely not worth   the change of curriculum two months in was extremely frustrating and i found the content of the course to be more of a medical assistant course rather than on ot assistant course  i felt completely unprepared and lost going into workplacement  the only positive was the support from supervisor renee during the workplacement
4,03-08-2017,for the most part open colleges was a,for the most part open colleges was a great experience was difficult at times to get help with study in relation to finding a study buddy and some of the learning materials were out of date or the links were broken having  a breakdown of the modules assessments was helpful video recordings were difficult at times to put togetherwould recommend to friends
1,02-08-2017,jump through hoops to complete a cert,this course had some stupid time consuming points to it i found it hard to deal with the assessors who always had an excuse to fail your assessments or add extra work for you to do that wasn't actually specified in the question or criteria videos were hard to get done and were essentally pointless as you had to mark it off at work placement anyway i did not find this course enjoyable due to these reasons the assessors and the videos
3,02-08-2017,very good until i got to the work,very good and efficient until i got to the work experience and interview aspect where it was unclear how long it would take to get approval and the wait times for approval and corresponding interview times were very long
5,02-08-2017,studding through open collages was a,studding through open collages was a very positive experiencethe course was laid out in an easy to follow format with  training videos that were informative and easy to understand if i needed help with anything the support team were always friendly and quick to respond navigating from one area to another within the program was easy as wellthe trainers are very patient and helpful
1,01-08-2017,there was one person i dealt with that,there was one person i dealt with that was capable of helping me to finish this course monica p  course materials were out of date links in these materials and online assessments did not work your online platform is horrific to navigate through you get no responses from trainers when you contact them through open spaces so are forced to call the student support helpline to get a real person to contact you you are not equipped to deal with nonstandard students as in i did not do the course in the order of studies and had multiple rpls which seemed to be an issue for you received incorrect information and different answers to the same questions  i would never recommend anyone study through open colleges  you're quick to sign students up and take their money but then disappear and are unhelpful
1,01-08-2017,i started paying for my course on th,i started paying for my course on th july it is now st august and i have still not received access to my course no one will answer my emails or messages via the contact us form what is going on
4,01-08-2017,cert  teachers aide course review,i found the supervisors very helpful responsive and answered questions i had in a very good quick time frame in relation to the course i found some modules with a lot of repetitive questions being used in the  assessment tasks at times some of the questions were not clear in response to what was actually been asked and had to have some things clarified a few times before i could proceed on the quiz assessments it would be nice to know what the answers are to the questions that you get wrong you do found out if you have to take the quiz again but if you pass and still get a couple wrong it would be great to find out what the answers were  it was a great course to do and i would recommend it to anyone
5,01-08-2017,my experience with open colleges was,my experience with open colleges was fantastic i would highly recommend them to anyone
4,01-08-2017,need more assessors to alleviate their work load,i feel that the feedback could be better and quicker  sadly the teachers and assessors are very overworked which makes me feel they are very much understaffed to enable quick turnaround  when you have a three day turnaround or more for questions your time is very much encroached upon when you only have a certain amount to complete the course and this can become rather frustrating at times  they also need to update their email system as this inhibits communication  material needs to also be proof read as their are mistakes that can also take time to work out that it is not your fault and this also delays time  if these areas are looked into the college would be a wonderful resource for many persons that work and study as many of the students do not have the access to go to university because of committments and time is of the essence
1,31-07-2017,i joined open colleges to study a  diploma of youth work,i joined open colleges to study a diploma in youth work i opted for a payment plan at the beginning as i have a family with  kids and times are tough anyway fast forward  months i have completed my diploma which is awesome but open colleges won't provide me with my diploma because i am on a payment plan and i still have a balance owing yes i signed the agreement and the student handbook but no one verbally told me i wouldn't recover my diploma until the balance is zerothis is ridiculous anyone who completes study understands the instant gratification you receive when you complete studyif i would have been verbally told about not receiving the diploma until paid off there is no way in the world i would have chosen this organisationon the flip side my teachers were great
5,31-07-2017,enjoyed studying with open college,enjoyed studying with open college lots of help and flexibility
4,30-07-2017,more pros than cons,there were some inconsistencies in the course work and the quiz answers some answers were wrong which was shown by the text in the reading material being a less popular course this wasn't a major surprisethe trainers were extremely helpful addressing the above concerns promptlythe trainers made it worth going with this provider down to earth knowledgeable real peopleadmin was smooth only once or twice did it take more than a few days to get a response but that's because the enquiry was interdepartmentalall in all a thorough course with good variety and professional trainers
4,29-07-2017,positive experience,i had a very good experience with open colleges the majority of the trainers i dealt with were very helpful and replied to my questions very quickly i loved the forums as could get info from other learners too i had a few bad experiences with student suppprt where i was getting conflicting information whenever i called about a particular enquiry which was very frustrating but got sorted in the end i really enjoyed doing the course and would definitely consider doing another course with open colleges in the future

1,27-07-2017,disappointed,well presented learning site and easy to usethey didn't handle governement transitioned courses well student support was good though they missed that i was lacking an elective so i didn't graduate when i should have even though i sought clarity from them for  months i also made an official complaint which was resolved well at first but they also didn't pick up on the missing elective even when i asked them to give me a clear list of what i needed to do to graduate very disappointed that my graduation and subsequent university degree enrolement was put into jeopardy because of their lack of organisational processes which has put a mark on my whole experience with them nil compensation for their mistakes
4,27-07-2017,overall i had a great experience,overall i had a great experience studying with open colleges it gave me the flexibility i needed to complete my course and the support from my trainer was great the only negative i have was the course material was old and a little dated

5,25-07-2017,do it you won't regret it,i found the course was easy to understand openspace was so easy to navigate and everything was available at the click of a button julie miller is an amazing trainer and her interaction and support couldn't be matched a fantastic experience all the way i am a very anxious person but i found this course to be one of the best things i have ever done
5,25-07-2017,great course structure,great course structure support available almost  and great feedback from most of the moderators on assignments
5,24-07-2017,i enjoyed this course so much,studying at my own pace meant i could find time when it suited me the work was practical and the trainers were responsive and helpful feedback on assessments was quick and specific i'm actually sad that the course has ended
5,24-07-2017,assessor excellent,i was extremely impressed by the prompt and professional responses from my assessor kimberly kim her inputs was very helpful in understanding the study material and directing my focus to the relevant aspects thereof this will stand me in good stead in the practical implementation of the course materialsupport was excellent
1,24-07-2017,look else where to complete this,look else where to complete this course the work load from open colleges is ridiculously huge compared to other providers the support that is provided is minimal assessments are often marked incorrectly eg with the wrong person's name in the comments etc would not recommend people complete this course through open colleges
4,23-07-2017,some aspects of the course concerning,some aspects of the course concerning technology are outdated leaving a massive gap in the teaching and learningfeedback was timely and thorough

5,23-07-2017,loved it,i loved studying through open colleges the ease of online self paced thoroughly supported learning made studying a pleasure rather than something to dread totally recommend it thankyou
5,23-07-2017,great time with open colleges,studying at open colleges was really a great experience my trainer was really helpful and supportive i had a great time with open colleges thanks to the teachers and trainers
5,22-07-2017,great option for studying while working,great option for studying while working and plenty of very interesting courses
5,20-07-2017,rewarding experience,i had such a rewarding experience doing this course it was my first time doing an online course although self study proved challenging at first but it suited me best being a mum all trainers and support staff were always swift to provide assistance  i was also impressed with the course layout i feel very gratified on being able to complete this course and having had entered and learnt about a totally new field i have already recommended open colleges to some of my friends and will continue to do so thank you all at open colleges making this possible for me
1,20-07-2017,i do not recommend this company,i would never recommend this course to anyone i completed my diploma in early childhood education and care after many mix ups from the assessorsthey added more course material without telling me and after the assessor told me there was no other requirementsthe assessors took weeks to reply even to simple questions and mark assessmentsthey were extremely rude unsupportive and unhelpful when they eventually did get back to me and it made it very difficult to complete my requirementsnot only was it the assessors but the actual course material for work placement was beyond rediculous my placement staff also could not believe what was expected of us and them it made it hard to actually observe and experience everyday practices with the amount of activities we had to complete and which weren't practical at allnot only was this course completely reliable on yourself without help from trainers the requirements are triple compared to others i know studying at an institutei had raised my concerns with program managers and student support without a suitable resolutioni am glad i have now completed my diploma as it was an awfully stressful time in my life which should have been made easier with the promised support and guidance of the assessors
2,19-07-2017,frustrating to deal with,when i needed the support open colleges was very frustrating to communicate with would not recommend to a friend wasn't worth the headache
2,19-07-2017,graphic design pathway  a path through hell and back,i enrolled in the graphic design pathways program before the transition to the new course so i don't know if everything is still the same but some of my complaints are unlikely to have been addressed by the new coursethe entire course was structured around peertopeer learning and review sounds good on paper but it was frequently the blind leading the blind i lost count of the number of terrible designs i saw from fellow students who then gave truly unhelpful feedback to their peers you should do this terrible thing instead i like this terrible thing with no constructive input from trainers at all in fact there was no guidance from the trainers until our assessments were submitted by which point it was too late to address fundamental flaws in learning trainers really should not be called trainers if they aren't going to trainthe pdfs we received instead of guidance from trainers were riddled with typos and broken links to missing references  at one point at least you misspelt learning how telling more importantly though countless links to videos and articles explaining things the trainers should have been explaining themselves links to material that was meant to clarify and expand on the pdfs were broken lost to the ravages and reinventions of time on the internet and no substitute links were provided to replace them  i get that constantly checking and updating the pdfs was beyond the capability of this institution which teaches its students how to research and how to use indesign to make interactive pdfs but a running tally on the forum for each module with alternate links to similar materials should not have been that difficult and should not have to be suggested by students after the factand this horrifying lack of proofing was not limited to the pdfs  the assessments themselves were also riddled with typos missing words and terribly vague language to the point where it often seemed like the assessment had been run through google translate four or five times more horrifically there was a question on at least one of the multiple choice quizzes whose official answer was thoroughly and obviously incorrect this was raised by a student to the trainer and the response was along the lines of meh too expensive to fix it what kind of attitude is that to have i paid  for this course as did everyone else and all of the material we received was thoroughly out of date and no one on your side of the forum wall seems to carespeaking of the forum good god how ineffective a tool were you looking to build replies to posts are meant to generate notifications so that the original poster knows someone has looked at their stuff but no no notifications for any post on any forum for any study period and again this is a course that relies on peertopeer learning which demands feedback be sought and received and considered and integrated into or rejected from a final design it's one thing to have to manually track your own posts on forums based on where you're up to but your replies to other students that they might then reply back to or not asking for further clarification or feedback on a new iteration of their design those disappear forever and if there's going to be a set limit on how big a preview image can be make it an inherent limit in the forum the number of times i couldn't load a thread because my internet connection couldn't handle the number of high res preview images other students had posted at full size despite the clear and consistent guidelines was staggering at the end of a billing cycle i frequently just had to give up on study because i couldn't even check to see if anyone had bothered to provide feedback on my work and i barely ever received feedback from other students anyway and from trainers almost never so it was always a futile process thank god i was finally directed to a facebook group by another student a group of students actually interested in providing feedback as much as receiving it because without that group there is no way i could have made it through all the stress and anxiety this course heaped upon me and i guarantee that that's a common feelingas a side note i wasn't directly affected by the transition into the new course because i finished everything just before the deadline but the number of other students i saw in the facebook group talking about all the mismanagement and conflicting information they had received regarding the transition was honestly by that stage it was just typical open colleges ineptitude i get that there probably wasn't a lot of information on your end because it was a government mandated process that was partially out of your control but from our end it was just a shitstorm of misinformation and that's when people were actually told about the transition  i only found out because of discussions on the facebook group i never received any kind of notice from open colleges though i can't say i'm surprised when you continued to enroll students in the old course who would have no way of completing the course before transition time despite you continually saying you had no idea how credits would work between the twospeaking of the new course when i applied for an extension earlier this year due to mental health issues it was granted in theory but in practice my enrollment was discontinued in the old course and i was enrolled anew in the new course with no credit for the with i had already done i had applied for the extension because of stress and anxiety this debacle did not help my situationso yeah terrible infrastructure terribly managed loads of misinformation given all of this i think you'll agree that two stars is actually an incredibly generous review the only reason it isn't a single star is that the description uses the word rude and no one from oc was ever rude to me though some of the feedback i received for some of my assessments are definitely patronising let there be no mistake in this though i wouldn't dare recommend the course or the company to anyone ever
5,17-07-2017,i thoroughly enjoyed the course,i thoroughly enjoyed the course much more content than i could have imagined i have learnt so much throughout the course only with the help of my tutors who were excellent with feedback and encouragement i would recommend this course without hesitation to anyone with an interest in photography regards
5,17-07-2017,i found the course material to be,i found the course material to be interesting and the addition of videos informative  the assignment instructions are clearly explained and easy to follow  the course was challenging without a doubt but after completion of each subject module i found i was driven to continue until i reached the end  a huge personal achievement
5,17-07-2017,i learnt so much studying through open colleges,i learnt so much studying through open colleges the range of assignments kept me interested and the feedback from the trainers was timely and detailed although i would have liked to have more training in the programs used to create designs eg photoshop and indesign the course itself made me learn them in a couple of years or one i will probably come back and study at open colleges again
5,16-07-2017,helpful,helpful accommodating and realxed i had a good time doing my course and my writing has definitely improved with the advice and resources provided for me from my tutor
4,16-07-2017,great course i enjoyed it and would love to do an advanced version,great course great content and support is the course expensive for what it ismaybeif work paid for it yes i would do more courses if i had to pay no as  i think the courses are expensive for what they arebut i would certainly recommend the courses
1,16-07-2017,very disappointing,terribly organised coursework and communication i ended up only having access to the old no longer valid coursework which i only discovered after i contacted open colleges at this stage i was at least  months into my course and open colleges told me i'd have to start the new coursework from the beginning with no credit given for the assessments which i had already completed even though they had not given me any access to the new coursework after some pleading i was kindly given an extra month as compensation for the  months i'd lost as a result of their errorthe coursework quizzes and assessment material contain spelling and grammar mistakes throughout incorrect worked examples and quiz questions which the tutorstrainers are aware of yet still do not remove nor notify students about tutors are usually responsive to messages however they give advice such as don't bother with the extra readings don't worry about doing the 'check your progress' questions or extra activities etc i'm sad to say but i would not recommend open colleges to anyone
4,15-07-2017,mostly positive experience,i have had a mostly positive experience during my time at open colleges the content was informative but i struggled to understand some modules even after reading the workbooks and had to use google forvthe price we pay it would have been nice to have the option to have printed copies mailed to usthe staff were fantastic and were happy to provide assistancei would love to see some video training sessions for some modules to better set students up for their assessments particularly for application based modulesopenspace has definitely improved but is not perfect the graph that shows how far i am wasn't updated during the website transition it is better than some of the other online providers out there response times from trainers and assessors was very quickoverall i enjoyed my time at open colleges and i would recommend people check it out
4,15-07-2017,very good course,my studies with open colleges were fabulous and highly recommended for people who are too busy for on campus studyi liked studying at my own pace easy access to learning materials and assessments and thought provoking learning materialsthe assessors were great always respond quicklyand grading done quickly however when asking for assistance would be good if had telephone capability sometimes after back and forth messages still not sure on some thingsoverall am very satisfied
4,14-07-2017,open college's is a terrific system,open college's is a terrific system with incredible teachers and a fantastic easy and manageable work load i would recommend this to anyone looking to work and study at the same time however i would not recommend this to someone of an extroverted nature as the lack of facetoface interaction was a little bit of a buzzkill but still a terrific learning system
5,14-07-2017,definitely recommend to people who wants to learn something new in their spare time,i studied diploma of interior design and decoration the course structure and teachings are excellent and i learnt a lot of new skills and knowledge tutors and student service are great too
4,14-07-2017,great value,mostly great service assignment turn around time is fast and you get answered quickly when emailing would be good to have someone available mon to fri when struggling with content knowledge rather than rather than only admin staff webinars were great for me price was very good
5,14-07-2017,best online study,well i had my best days during my study period and i had a good support from the trainers and all others which really helped me to achieve in completing my coursethank you for all the support you have given methank once againregardssherine

5,13-07-2017,completing this course with open,completing this course with open colleges was great and fitted my work and life style perfectly very happy
1,13-07-2017,to be truthful i wouldnt recommend open,to be truthful i wouldnt recommend open colleges and the stuff around and incovedents of an over price couse with and call centre that tells me they are happy to help  and they will follow up and never do this course isnt updated and even my educational leader doesnt understand why i did didnt pass the question when they ask to use any method and when i use current materiald i will be calling open collegee to make a complaint
3,13-07-2017,some content great but open space a disaster,the mentors tutors and assessors particularly matt were brilliant and if not for them i may have given it away some  of the modules seemed very repetitive and were extremely boring whilst other modules were fascinating and very well written  open space  is atrocious not user friendly and full of bugs there were many spelling mistakes throughout the course notes and two errors which have since been fixed in the quizzes i did learn a lot and enjoyed many of the projects  pleased to have finished in six months
1,13-07-2017,do not study with open colleges,i cannot express enough how bad this provider is after a seemingly lovely conversation with my course advisor i happily signed up with a positive outlook on furthering my education after reading through my first workbook which had multiple spelling and grammar errors i submitted my assignment only to get a 'withheld' mark and vague feedback telling me i had failed everything after trying to depict the feedback for quite some time i had no choice but to email the trainer and reask exactly what was needed turns out i didn't fail every qu estion i just had to fix up two things and ended up with a hdit has since been noted that the spelling and grammar errors were not confined to that first workbook it is throughout all my workbooks and assignments and the vague responses to my questions regarding their awkwardly worded assignment questions are just as poor across all trainersand to top it all off i only signed up with them because i was assured that i could defer my course for free while i travelled europe for three months by my lovely course advisor only to be told that this was not the caseonce again do not choose to study with open colleges it is not even worth the one star i had to give it on this review or the money i spent on this course
4,13-07-2017,i found studying online great,i found studying online great making it easy to fit around my other commitments the workbooks and links were well presented assignments were marked quickly and always gave helpful feedback any queries i sent via email  about particular assignments were not answered which was disappointing otherwise it was a good experince thank you open colleges
4,13-07-2017,problems solved,generally i found it easy to navigate through the course and contact relevant trainers and assessors had a slight issue with work placement due to staff changes that was quickly and easily sorted outwas happy with how quickly i received my certificate upon completion would recommend open colleges
4,12-07-2017,a mixed bag,a mixed bag during this online course initially very little communication from trainers and very little feedback or advice the later half of my course was great i had a new assessor named jason and he was very helpful offering great feedback and valuable insight into the industry overall a positive experience however would recommend more studentteacher interaction
1,12-07-2017,bad bad bad the communication takes,bad bad bad the communication takes weeks at a time to get a response  not to mention i finished my course  months ago and still am yet to recieve my certificate  terrible
2,12-07-2017,my experience with open colleges has been the worse,my experience with open colleges has been a huge disappointment and honestly a waste of my money i am doing my cert  in early childhood education and care and before starting i was promised alot such as support since starting i did recieve support up until our trainer became ill and then my messages and emails were not returned and were going unansweredapart from the lack of support during this course the work load and the information provided was great but then i was up to work placement and the electives and then it just went from bad to worse the work load with the electives logbook and portfolio is just beyond ridiculous so ridiculous that even the director at the centre i did my placement at was laughing and saying it was so much for a cert  im at the point in the course where im considering stopping and asking open colleges for rpl and transferring to a different organisation however i just found out from another student that that wont be happening cause she went to do the same and they didnt give her transcripts so jokes on me open colleges just got  from me claps for youi would never recommend oc to anyone
2,12-07-2017,my review,i chose open colleges to study my cert  in early childhood because it was online and flexible however i was also promised lots of support which i feel i didn't receivewhen enrolling i asked about work placement and open colleges made work placement sound like a walk in the park however i was expected to find and organise my own work placement not only did i have to log  hours i also had to complete a massive work placement portfolio it was huge and very overwhelming i tried ringing open colleges for support but was told to email my trainer to make a time to speak over the phone my trainer was not available for another  weeks i was also required to get a lot of evidence and signatures from the supervisors at work placement which wasn't always easy lucky for me my work placement were very understanding however other students haven't been so luckyduring my study our trainer fell ill and ended up leaving i felt open colleges wasn't honest with the students with what was happening our messages and posts to the forum were going unansweredi also got minimal feedback on many of my assessments sometimes it felt like the marker hadn't even read my assessment suggesting i write things that i had already writtenopen colleges aren't always easy to deal with and sometimes it is hard to know what they expect one example is the first aid certificate we are required to get on our own it was unclear if we were meant to upload it like other assessments or email it once i finally worked out who to email it to i found out it actually needed to be verified by a jp first and then emailed i'm not a mind readeropen space the online portal is not very user friendly it is incredibly slow and frustratingdue to the lack of support i received from open colleges and how isolated i felt i created a facebook study group this group now has about  members we have been able to support and encourage each other it is so sad to hear of other students who have had change of circumstances but are still locked into paying for a coursemy cert  was very involved and i learnt a lot i have also begun my dream job in the early childhood industry and am loving it i have open colleges to thank for thatopen colleges are great if you're happy to motivate yourself to study and do it at your own pace online however if you are requiring a little more support i recommend you look at other options too
3,12-07-2017,certificate iv in allied health assistance physiotherapy,i completed certificate iv in allied health assistance physiotherapyi have extensive prior learning in similar fieldsi cannot see how this course could be sufficient for those without prior learningexperience in the fieldi dont think those without prior learningexperience could finish this course and be ready to be independent in employment in either the private or public system
4,12-07-2017,received the help i needed when,received the help i needed when requested  i would recommend open colleges to anyone
4,11-07-2017,i found open colleges complemented my,i found open colleges complemented my busy life being a working mum there were no time pressures onme to have things in by a certain date i could just chip away at itsupport was ok it did take  days for support services to get back to me it does state that thoughi got my course completed in mknths and got a job where i was doing my placement
4,11-07-2017,great study platform,great study platform study materials are great but sometimes outdated overall services are good i managed to finish my course in  years even though i didn't have accounting background when i enrolled i saw some students struggles  alot with minimum help from trainerassessorsit would be much more better if open college services timely and fast reply to students when question ask for help
5,11-07-2017,the best option,being a parttime working mum with both children in primary school this was the best option for me to become qualified in my chosen career they were very understanding when things were not going as expected in life and allowed me extra time to complete my course the course has made me so much more confident in my chosen field i would recommend open colleges to anyone
5,11-07-2017,the creative writing courses are,the creative writing courses are informative challenging and fun the valuable feedback from a  more than competent trainer helped me to open myself up to grow and develop new skills
1,11-07-2017,i would not recommend this institution,i would not recommend this institution they came in a great deal cheaper than tafe which sparked my initial decision to enrol however the course was structured poorly grammatical mistakes throughout assignments lead to many misunderstandings which were hard to clarify with the lack of assistance all correspondence was email based with no help available other than technical via phone my main point of contact holly would respond promptly to email queries though would clearly not read my email properly and therefore not answer half of my questions this lead to days wasted and too many unnecessary emailsoverall i studied a cert iv in business admin the content of the course was hit and miss with some topics useful and most not unnecessary  ie the complicated finance module pay the extra money and do the tafe alternative i have now studied via correspondence with both institutions and would not recommend this one as a viable choice it was difficult to gain motivation to keep going with all the issues encountered
5,11-07-2017,this is the second time i have used,this is the second time i have used open colleges having now completed a diploma in accounting and a diploma in human resource management very happy with them the course material is very good and helpful assignments are easy to follow staff are quick to respond
5,10-07-2017,a transformative experience,i found the program extremely relevant to the growth of the business networking and the guidance from the tutors propelled my business to the next level pushed me to work smarter by systemising my processes many key points i will continue to take on board in my practice everyday and also for future ventures highly recommend
1,10-07-2017,i honestly thought this was a joke,i honestly thought this was a joke when i received this email and you will probably write this off as a disgruntled trainee but open colleges was the most unprofessional rto i have ever dealt with for the following reasons you lied to me constantly about numerous things such as course content completion times and response times online trainers are substandard and unless i copied and paste from online material would be constantly marked incorrect with no reason the turn around time was never adhered too some items took months to mark the call center is dysfunctional and would never follow through with what they promised i have completed my course and my online percentage is still  go figure everything was submitted months ago the trainers would book appointments for phone interviews and never call or email to give excuse i would end up following up and was told very abruptly to book an appointment the trainers would send me emails with different peoples names and details asking for content already submitted and marked correct the training package was of a very poor quality the online complaints form is a joke when all i received back was an email telling me you had reviewed and closed my case with no way forward or outcome i was informed i could complete this course in  months but due to open colleges pathetic response rate it took me over  months this certainly cost me a lot of money at work as my promotion was delayed and almost cost me my job the trainers were oblivious to the stress they cause by constantly calling and emailing my boss just to request the same material they had already received the way the call center answers the phones is disgustingi honestly could go on for a long time with this but i know this will fall on deaf ears as when i was a student you completely ignored my requests i would rate my experience with oc as a zero out of ten and could not recommend your company to anyone i will be reporting your company to asqa and do hope you learn from this and make it better for the next studentsplease feel free to call me to discuss further as i am happy to give further feedbackregardskaren
3,10-07-2017,you need more trained staff,you need more trained staff only  are properly well equipped to help students the others don't carefor those  staff to whom students engage with participating in your program i truly recommend as they are extremely helpful
5,10-07-2017,great support,in my time of need or panic when my assessments are late trainers and student support have always been very supportive and understandingi have done  different courses with them and highly recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to study
4,09-07-2017,open colleges,great experience over the past two years very easy to understand all content and to receive help when needed
3,08-07-2017,good course material but,good course material but inconsistencies in the assignments i needed to seek clarification on some points this said the response from the trainer was good and prompt as a first time online student i struggled to some extent without frequent feedback
5,10-07-2017,it took me a little while to trust the,it took me a little while to trust the lecturer with my writing and a while to adjust my ego to his responses but once i relaxed and realised his comments were very constructive the whole experience became extremely helpful  yes i would recommend anyone interested in learning about fiction or poetic writing to to undertake the course
4,07-07-2017,great support,the course was easy to access and the support is great they want to help you finish and do well
5,07-07-2017,i enjoyed learning with open colleges,i enjoyed learning with open colleges and would highly recommend it to my friendsthe course was very informative and will surely help me in gaining employment as it taught me many skills i previously didn't have
5,06-07-2017,overall a good online learning,overall a good online learning experience
4,06-07-2017,my experience was awesome from always,my experience was awesome from always being there to help and getting assessments back quickly and so much encouragement
3,06-07-2017,a frustrating experience,i found my overall experience to be extremely frustratingi found that the course material was ok but the assignments were very hard to decipher they were badly written with grammatical and wording errors or just did not make sense sometimes watching a webinar on an assignment gave a different picture of what was required to how the assignment readalthough i found my trainer to be very quick to respond to me which was very much appreciated i found that my specific questions were not always addressed i sometimes found that the guidance i was given was just as if not more confusing than reading the assignmentsi often looked for answers on the open space posts but found that people appeared to be encouraged to message trainers privately and would not get their questions answered for others to see these were general questions which would help many other students i would also think that it would save the trainers and assessors much time as if they answered questions in the posts it would  save them answering the same individual question time after timeanother issue i found was that when my trainer went on leave the replacement trainer did not appear to answer anyone's postsperhaps oc could read some of the posts to see the frustration students are feeling
4,06-07-2017,student and trainers were brilliant,student support was brilliant always someone there to help out when need course was fairly simple to grasp just need all the links to work consistently to external material only a few times did the assessment questions confuse but after looking at it again more carefully you comprehended it feedback from trainers was great and helped you grow after each assessment and self checks some trainers were amazing and provided additional tips to grow and strengthen your skill settrainers really know the area of study and are working in it at same time which is helpful to youyou must be prepared to learn programs on own as only minimal is taught in the modules with expectation to study on external online tutorials not an issue but be prepared to equate this into your study timetable extension was easy to organise with a minimum fee overall well worth it nice and flexible i got out exactly what i put into the course hard work and great results thanks heaps i'm a very happy student  more a  star just minor tweaks needed
3,06-07-2017,online study can be tricky,online study is very tricky if you are not used to this type of study it's really all about how much effort you want to put in and how much you should engage with the trainers overall my experience has been good and the material was helpful my only constructive criticism is that i would recommend that all student support staff be on the same page when communicating news or updates to students so that they all don't hear different stories
5,06-07-2017,can't fault open colleges in any way,can't fault open colleges in any way their flexible online course has help me take the first steps to achieving my goal in an industry that i am passionate about  the course content was revelant to my industry and presented in a professional manner  the support team trainers and assessors were always helpful and responded to all my needs in a timely manner
5,05-07-2017,i thoroughly enjoyed my on line study,i thoroughly enjoyed my on line study for my cert v aod and i loved my  hours of work placement the material is easy to download the support i received while studying was terrific i would recommend open colleges to anyone wanting to advance their career
1,05-07-2017,open colleges have been the most,open colleges have been the most unsupportive rto if you can call them that for my partner during his course his emails have gone unanswered and is expected to know all the answers to assignments and quizzes without having any content in the modules open colleges have refused a refund on several occasions even though we have provided beyond enough evidence and documentation more than what they asked for however they have a different excuse every time they receive the documents and evidence open colleges should be shut down please avoid signing up with them you will not receive support and expect to know everything we have lost  because of this dodgy company avoid at all costs
5,04-07-2017,studying through open colleges online,studying through open colleges online has been rewarding with great organisation and support provided
3,04-07-2017,this is not a course for someone who,this is not a course for someone who wants detailed written explanations  there are videos explaining lightroom for example but no step by step instructions  and no reading list  the course materials need a comprehensive revision to remove internal contradictions and inconsistencies  but the trainers are great  quick responsive and helpful
4,03-07-2017,amazing support,i would not have commpleted the course if it was not for the support and encouragement from my assessors
3,03-07-2017,solid but needs some polishing,course material was solid and comprehensive  it could have used a proof readmy issue was that the course trainers were slow to respond to questions and the course was transitioned to a newer course half way through  which was handled poorly i was left thinking i'd finished but had a module still to do  to their credit they did give me extra time to complete once the issue was discovereda decent training provider but in need of some 'polishing' in their processes
3,03-07-2017,more help from tutors and return emails,more help from tutors and return emails when a question is asked  i found there to be not much help  errors in modules   no correct answers in some quizzes
5,02-07-2017,great experience,i found all the staff at open colleges so helpful when enrolling and when completing the coursestaff were always more than willing to give feedback when i asked or had any concerns regarding course work
1,02-07-2017,absolutely fking terrible,absolutely fking terrible it is only a matter of time before aca or today tonight do a story on these prcksif you want an education this is not the place for yougo here to look at the real reviews
4,02-07-2017,i did the creative writing course,i did the creative writing course the content and feedback has improved my skill as a writer communication is always simple and friendly with my teacher the course was very flexible on it's time parameters great experience
2,02-07-2017,work travel placement  no support,i have recently graduated with a certificate iii in travel and feel open colleges provided little to no support especially in terms of the 'mandatory'  hour work travel placement i live in a capital city and approached  travel agencies without success  most agencies citing they did not have the resources to host a placement or only hosted students from other institutions finally after  months of trying to find a placement without any assistance from open colleges i was fortunate to secure a placement with a couple who ran a business from their home and they supported me for  hours with  hours remaining of the placement i didn't know what to do and sought assistance from open colleges without success thankfully i was able to submit travel bookings i make at work as evidence and these enabled me to graduatemy suggestion to open colleges for including a 'mandatory' work travel placement in this course is to enter into service agreements with several agencies who are willing to host their students the stress involved in trying to find a placement without support is not warranted students should be given a list of agencies to approach and feel confident that they will be given a work travel placement as i stated previously i live in a capital city  not sure how students who live in regional areas manage to find placements
5,30-06-2017,great way of studying,great way of studying great support
3,30-06-2017,thank you to the assessors,the assessors were brilliant they were quick to review and gave me good tips for improvement thank you very much to you allon the other hand its website needs better attention my course was revised while i was studying and maybe because of it my progress still shows  when i already got a certificate of completion of my course there were some serious mistakes on the study material and they couldn't reviseupdatecorrect it straight away

4,29-06-2017,really enjoyed the course,really enjoyed the course would have preferred some more input from trainers and fellow students
4,28-06-2017,need to make sure course notes and instructions are up to date,correspondence and the people i dealt with were excellent the only issue was having the assessments course notes and instructions up to date some needed to be changed as they were out of date and applied only to previous years i think an annual auditreview of course material is required to remove these errors
5,28-06-2017,great course well run,great course well run informative and a reliable platform for learning
5,28-06-2017,excellent experience,this is my first time do online study and i find that all the teachers are very supportive and helpful which make me complete the course successfullythank you for the excellent team

5,27-06-2017,they supported me well and i really,they supported me well and i really enjoyed the coursemy only feedback is that the course took me longer than the guided time that they suggested
5,27-06-2017,with out the support from open space i,with out the support from open space i would not have my certificate and completed my course  the support is absolutely amazing you can always count on the student support to help you out the website is very simple and easy to access which is what i liked it had resources for you to help with your modules  i am so thankful for their support  and i would chose open colleges because you have so much support behind you and you can trust them they don't disrespect they always help out as much as possible and it's a great experience
5,27-06-2017,incredibly supportive trainers,incredibly supportive trainersi prefer to study via distance as i am able to do things at my own pace i was supported the entire time by the trainers if i ever needed their helpthe course content was a lot more difficult than what i thought but that was a good thing because i was able to push myself and learnt so much from the coursethe payment plan option to pay off the course was also ver affordable for my family and i didn't even notice it because it was such a small payment
5,26-06-2017,great course content,great course content excellent trainers quick response and marking
5,26-06-2017,i have found the whole experience of,i have found the whole experience of the courses i chose wonderful and my tutors very helpful
2,26-06-2017,graphic design course was disappointing,i feel openspace needs a lot of improvement the learning activities are not looked at by open college staff with feedback only coming from fellow learners occasionally i personally feel i need more feedback from experts not fellow students who are also only learning i feel the user interface of openspace is not user friendly at all  things are hard to find navigation is not streamlined and the forums are atrocious the message platform could use some work and the interaction with module facilitators could be much better i did not submit anything for a whole year and no one noticed or bothered to ask if i had any problems luckily i was able to get an extension otherwise the entire course would have been a waste of time i feel that the course content does not relate completely to the assignments i feel that it is ridiculous to ask for us to complete a website design in a program we have never used and the course material has not covered don't tell me to watch youtube videos to learn how to use dreamwaever what am i paying open college for if i have to learn through youtube videos i think that this college needs to up it's game the course content has numerous spelling and grammatical errors the lecturers need to give more feedback and relate to each student on a more personal level i had to get in touch with a facebook group to give me feedback as the forum is useless for any feedback i am very glad i am finished my course and have my certificate
5,25-06-2017,open colleges,open collegesi found open colleges great way to enhance knowledge and acquire nationally recognised qualification it was really useful for my day to day job

4,24-06-2017,it's great learning new things,it's great learning new things everyday my only complaint is that it should provide more student support especially for those with learning disabilities
4,24-06-2017,firstly i never like to rate somebody,firstly i never like to rate somebody as  as there is always areas that can be improved  with respect to the way the course is run it was excellent  for somebody like myself an it professional it was easy to navigate and access all the required areas  i didnt find certain parts of the site of use such as the student lounge primarily because any questions that i may have had were answered on the facebook page  there were a number of errors in the material or quizes which i raised at the time  some of the material may need to be updated particularly in the later stages where social media is probably more prominent as a means of attracting clients than a web site although a web site is still very important overall though i was very happy with the course the trainers and their feedback  i learnt a great deal and it has helped me start a secondary income source
2,27-03-2018,graphic design,i did their graphic design course online as i have to work and i learned a lot and the trainers were really knowledgeable and helpful to me this was the only positive i found their website very confusing and counterintuitive

4,22-06-2017,really enjoyed this course,really enjoyed this course i do think i would have preffered an alertemail when my grades came through rather than checking over and over creating alot of anxiety at times grades took longer than  business days which was frustrating and i did find towards the end i was getting quite vague and unhelpful answers to questions i had asked when i was stuck i took it upon myself to do more research as i couldnt be bothered waiting for responses i do feel that majority of the content was well set out and certainly relevant to my job role i really appreciate the flexibility with the extension too
5,21-06-2017,incredible support throughout the,incredible support throughout the course the trainers and assessors are there  with quick responses to queries you may have their online platform is easy to use to upload assessments and download learning material would highly recommend open colleges for anyone looking at advancing their education

3,21-06-2017,in the beginning of the course there,in the beginning of the course there was good support but i found toward the end there was constant chasing up on my side of what was happening with my certificate which took approx three weeks before i got any headway as to what was happening
4,21-06-2017,i really enjoyed my course and learnt a,i really enjoyed my course and learnt a lot the work placement component was excellent some of the course work could be a bit repetitive but it all helps to reinforce the knowledge being obtained my only criticism would be that there appears to be a shortage of people to assess work place assessments and i had to keep asking where some things were at over a period of months to ensure it all got done before the course end date
5,21-06-2017,will recommend to my mates,clear learning pathway quick respond from instructors easy portal great learning materials with lots of addition information will recommend to my mates

3,19-06-2017,i enjoyed the course but i really think,i enjoyed the course but i really think the paperwork for workplacement is way too much for it to be signed as nursing is a busy environment apart from that it was good i could thank my assessors enough for their help throughout the course even the toughest and frustrating times through the workplacement process thanks again

4,13-06-2017,open colleges experience,a good experience to learn at your own pace you also have the support of the open colleges team through out the course
5,11-06-2017,best experience ever,at open colleges i had the best time as a student and mother of two young children i always wanted to work on my own conditions rather than following any hectic schedules and routines i am glad i approached open colleges and spoke to one of their efficient team members that was actually a life changing day i enjoyed their study formats learning materials and assessments whilst completing my other responsibilities without any stressthe team at open colleges are a bunch of some really amazing and wonderful people they are easy to approach are very helpful and always available whenever you required their help regarding any issuei can write on and on but to cut it short i enjoyed studying at open colleges i got the required support regarding the extension of the course as i was struggling to get it complete on time and they happily not only support me but give me more than required extension time their trainers and assessors and student support team were very helpful at the end as they say life changing education and they actually provide it
5,10-06-2017,my experience with open colleges was,my experience with open colleges was great it probably took me a bit longer than i thought but that was due to my own fault i needed a shoulder reconstruction  months after i startedstaff were always courteous and helpful and answered all my questionslearning materials were concise and challenging but in a good wayi would recommend open colleges to anyone looking to further their studies and i considering doing further courses myself and will do so with oc

4,09-06-2017,enjoyed the course and gained new skills,overall i enjoyed the course and gained some valuable skills i also found my workplace assessor to be very helpful and knowledgeable i did find reply times on messages to trainers a little slow at times which was frustrating when trying to finish an assignment i also found quite often that the wording of questions was not specific enough and i was having to contact trainers to clarify the length and detail required for these questions was quite often not specified either i also feel for my course that it would be beneficial for students if they could move into the work placement earlier allowing students to apply the skills in a practical setting as they are learning them i feel this would help students to understand the relevance of what they are learning in the theory and help them to stay focused and motivated to complete the work

1,07-06-2017,do not enrol with open colleges,do you your research first i wish i had open colleges is the worst experience i've had with any educationtraining provider ever the course materials were full of errors and out of date information and the assessments are poorly structured and written the trainer wasn't qualified or experienced and so far from being an expert in the field that it wasn't funny the trainer was changed but students were still being told to google for answers or that the trainer had to check with course writers before they could answer questions assessment feedback was copied and pasted across different students' assessments citing things they hadn't even done or included as well as inconsistent assessment marking between different trainers once open colleges have your money they couldn't care less for you as a student or as a paying customer their complaints resolution system is a joke unfair and inconsistent in their assessments and outcomes biggest waste of time and money i've ever experienced you couldn't pay me to study with this company again
5,07-06-2017,thank you  great college,materials were easy to access and navigate i accessed supports services a few times and they were very helpful open space is a good resource the trainers were quick to respond to requests which made the online learning experience much less isolating thank you

4,06-06-2017,as a new person to the country,as a new person to the country enrollment took me a little time to get to grips with  system did get my details slightly wrong but all got ironed out ok and have started the course  the course work is laid out great and easy to access and the marking process seems ok so far  i would definitely recommend others to use this on line learning college
4,05-06-2017,thank you open colleges,open colleges provide a great learning environment with impressive structured learning that is informative to the point and jargon free i never felt overwhelmed when reading through the learning materiali felt like i also reaped the benefits of an on campus college as the student support services were really beneficial from one on one appointments with tutors  assessors to assistance when finding work placement was just not being successfulall this extra support enabled me to still finish my course within only a year of a  year course whilst being a single mum working full time
4,05-06-2017,i was very happy in my dealings with,i was very happy in my dealings with open colleges
5,05-06-2017,course review,i thoroughly enjoyed the course i did with open colleges completed last year it was easy to access and follow and our actual course material was written in a way that was engaging as well as appropriately informative the turn around for assignments was speedy the links with my tutor as well as a chat room were all very encouraging the occasional e mail following work well done was similarly very welcome
5,04-06-2017,the courses are straight forward,the courses are straight forward easy to follow and the online portal used to load assessments is easy to navigatethe trainers are easy to contact and the assessors quick to mark and review your assignmentsi would recommend open colleges to anyone who can study in an open environment and is disciplined to self motivate and complete the study independently
5,04-06-2017,hi there,hi there i found my experience with open colleges to be a wonderful help to my writing since completing the course in romance writing in just under four months i have joined amazon kindle ebooks writing under the name of margaret todd my maiden name and have nine of my books out with them they are selling extremely well also i have my own website now therefore i would highly recommend the open colleges course in romance writing to anyone wishing to learn how to become a successful writer thank you winnifred tough
5,02-06-2017,st choice,easy access help whenever you need it well laid out and organised
5,02-06-2017,i hadn't studied formally for  years,i hadn't studied formally for  years and never online the team at open colleges were great they helped me every step of the way with the support and encouragement i received studying and learning quickly became a joythank you to everyone
2,02-06-2017,i found the overall experience to be not overly beneficial,i found the overall experience to be just ok support was lacking the online portal has the potential to be great but responses to questions were very poor if a question was asked about an assignment or particular question the trainer would simply repeat the question back as a response providing no real clarification content was poor to cover ergonomics three times was a total waste and to have to research printers was ridiculous in one assignment we were required to write a personal work plan pretending to work for a particular company  this would have been much more beneficial and motivating if it was based on real life i felt like much more time could have been devoted to something much more beneficial the audio components of every unit was a waste of time if this really is necessary it would be much better done with an assessor via skype or similar to create a proper dialogue more often than not it was simply repeating everythingwe had just written in the first part of the assignment with a participant who knew nothing of the course when i initially spoke with someone before i decided on the course i explained i wanted a course foucessed on payroll and accounts  her recommendation was this course which was really rather wrong very little time was spent on either of these topucs i cant help but wonder about the marking system i submitted one or two assignments that i felt were inferior quality and i still recieved a distinction i received a phone call when i was halfway through the final unit just touching base and to see if i needed any help rather pointless given i was  finished i don't think the certificate would really carry much weight in the minds of employers based on the content and how generous i found the markimg to be
4,02-06-2017,review,i found that it was very hard to upload videos when we were not allowed to do audio's when uploading assessments there is a limit of how much  you can upload and some of my video files exceeded that limit even when i had compressed the files the assessors are very helpful when you have questions
1,02-06-2017,i don't understand what i did wrong,i don't understand what i did wrong to be treated so poorly in this course i submitted all assignments edited them when i was asked  and still i was expected to wait multiple weeks and months for grades to come back and for the next modules to be unlockedi honestly would never ever recommend this service to anyone even people i don't like
3,01-06-2017,i thought the fact that you had to find,i thought the fact that you had to find your own external supervision on some assessments unfair in relation to the money paid to do the course  there were also typos throughout the course and in one of the  quizzes the answer that open colleges has earmarked is wrong and it is not until you question this that you are advised  this affects the ability to pass that quiz
2,01-06-2017,poor response in online training forum,the content has spelling mistakes  the lecturers don't respond to emails and if the email has been sent to the wrong lecturer rather than the recipient forwarding it to the correct person they reply and tell you to send another email

4,31-05-2017,i have loved the flexibility and,i have loved the flexibility and freedom of online learning overall i'd say it was all positive
4,31-05-2017,overall my experience was pretty good,overall my experience was pretty good the only issues i had were that when i needed help by the time i was able to get a response with a specific time for a phone call it had usually been over a week and i'd moved on and forgotten about what i needed help with in the first place i was also under the assumption that the student help line that is available from am  pm also included course trainers also some of the links that were provided were dead and need updating other than that there was good content and i learnt alotthank you
4,31-05-2017,extremely happy with my experience,extremely happy with my experience had amazing support from oc throughout the course the waiting times for my final interview and my portfolio marks were a bit excessive and i feel need improvement overall however i was very satisfied with this course and would recommend it
4,30-05-2017,studying with open colleges was really,studying with open colleges was really a good experience  the support team are really awsome and responsible they give feed back on the assignments very soon and effectivei appreciate their help
2,30-05-2017,many issues with open colleges,when working through module workbooks completing the learning activities within them there have been numerous times where a link has been given to complete questions and the link has not worked the computer states that there is an error with the link i have on a couple of occasions had to message staff to receive a replacement link however the broken link problem became so frequent i stopped sending emails to assessors as almost all of links i tried to access were unavailable this problem was taking up too much valuable study time as i had to wait for a response just to complete reading materials i noticed other students were having this problem as they wrote about it on the student discussion board they received no response that was helpful for them nor myself i feel as though the questions in assessments are not detailed enough when working through assessment pieces i answer the questions to the best of my ability and to how the question is worded a lot of the feedback i receive has been in regards to not giving enough detail within questions however the questions have not been worded in a way where it asks for such detail the only guide i have to know how much work is required per question is a box underneath the question that says marks out of  if the question requires more detail i believe a word count should be necessary so that i am not marked down and have to reattempt the assessment piece once again this takes up valuable study time where i could be progressing rather than backtracking having to fix silly mistakes that could be avoided through a better assessment layout and marking scheme i have had problems in the past with assessorstrainers not responding to my messages at all response times from trainers and assessors are too long and make my studies inefficient this leaves me feeling alone and unsupported within my studies i feel as though i have been left to my own devices the content within the workbooks i am provided does not always correspond to assessment questions examples of this arei got marked incorrectly for stating the use of abc would be appropriate in an emergency situation because it should have been drabc however when referring back to my workbook module  workbook i noticed that the acronym drabc was not written anywhere the open colleges booklet referred to it as abcin the same assessment piece module  assessment i was answering a question asking me how to treat a kitten that had been called away from a dog i was asked to reattempt this question as i did not state what medication was required as a part of the kittens healing process none of the modules i have completed to date have taught me about different medications and what situations to use them in if the question required this of me it should have asked what medications are required and the corresponding knowledge should have been accessible through the workbook or referred me to the additional resources available on openspace in the same assessment module  the assessor robyn bardsley referred to me as emma when giving feedback i found this to be very offensive as it made me feel like the assessor was not paying attention to who she was marking and it made me wonder if my responses were being read correctly i question whether or not feedback is simply copy and pasted by assessors from other students work this lack of attention to detail is extremely rude i also found it ironic that i was told to improve my spellinggrammar in assessments when robyn herself made multiple spelling and grammar mistakes i believe assessors and trainers should lead by example openspace is poorly constructed  lags breaks down very basic system  could be imrpoved with better uploading and messaging systems

3,27-05-2017,the course materials are out dated and,the course materials are out dated and not up to current standards assessments are poorly written and difficult to comprehend without further advice from trainers trainers are very difficult to get hold of emailing support gets you a standard copy and paste email which offers no assistance even when you specifically ask for someone to contact you overall unhappy with the level of support and learning materials for the  i am paying would not recommend

3,26-05-2017,i found the course moderator and,i found the course moderator and trainers to be very helpful however there was a number of errors in study materials and online tests the student support team were not very helpful or knowledgable and would provide contradictory information it could be quite a struggle to get basic information such as what modules you needed to complete also the online study site had incorrect information about what modules needed to be completed which i was told to ignore my student support because it was always wrong
5,26-05-2017,positive online study experience,positive online study experience  fantastic trainer overall very helpful and supportive staff
1,28-05-2017,to much time wasted for something that you are proud to say  we helped the ones with young families to get their qualification,as your student from your old setting i was promessed to have credits transferred in your new settling if i would finish my module  before the due date that didn't happen and i delivered what was asked from me plus your informations about changes and requirements and the time frame to achieve that was only  month there is a big restriction with taking practice or work placement if i compare the one from tafe because my time was good during tackling modules   i worked for  months  days a week as a volunteer  that was not taken into your considuration because did not fit in your time frame  you culd have at list looked into it all in all for me it was all downfall from the moment when you made the new setting in  you took my money that i payed in cash and i got nothing in return
4,26-05-2017,the experience i had with open colleges,the experience i had with open colleges was better than i had anticipated the online experience was better than expected the material was easy to understand and navigate through the course i did not think i would keep up the motivation to finish doing an online course but the training staff often sent emails to motivate  and set goals i would definitely do another course through open colleges

1,25-05-2017,won't study here again,will never study with open colleges againfirst enquired with open colleges in december  about studying the diploma of beauty therapy was pushed into enrolling because ill never get a deal like this again  ended up paying  on a payment plan which isn't bad at all the issues i have had and still do have are as follows communication at enrolment   i was never told that this course was still under development which is very scary putting my money into it not knowing the outcome the price in general after many consultations with other students and data collection and analysis there is a huge gap in pricing  anywhere from  up to  still have not received a response from open colleges direct as to why so many girls are charged such drastic different amounts as one of the girls said when she spoke with their student support they told me it depended on who i spoke to and that they choose how much they want to charge and when this is absolutely wrong in so many waysthis is just a warning to those wanting to study with open colleges especially the diploma of beauty therapy ask questions just because it is cheap doesn't always mean it is the best option to go with
5,24-05-2017,execellent opportunity to do online,execellent opportunity to do online study
4,24-05-2017,great until it came to getting the actual certificate,i thought the course was great with excellent support and quality course material right up until the end when it came to actually getting the certificate student support were great and i don't know if it was just the final person doing the gradings that was the issue or something else but it shouldn't take  months to get a certificate after finishing and meeting all course requirements in fact this is the reason i've chosen not to do my diploma with open colleges
5,24-05-2017,online learning of open colleges for me,online learning of open colleges for me is the most suitable learning style most of things available for learning material  i am so busy but i want to study to achieve more skills and knowledge with certificate i can access my learning  at anytime from anywhere internet available although the cost is a bit expensive for me a care worker i will save some money and do it
4,24-05-2017,experience so far,have just started studying through open college it is bit daunting at first as you have to do everything by yourselfbut hopefully will get through some of the topics are really good with videos to watch that helps understand the topic better and others are self research it would be good if the first aid training was included as a part of the fees and do not have to pay separately on top of the fees which is annoying must disclose this information when students join the oc overall its good to start with
5,23-05-2017,just great,just great thanks
4,23-05-2017,found difficult contact with student,found difficult contact with student support when necessary
5,23-05-2017,marketing course,course navigation is very selfexplanatory and help is readily available overall very impressed with them
2,23-05-2017,the information is good that i receive,the information is good that i receive to learn but their is poor handling of assignments when being marked  i have to wait too long for them to be marked before i can start the next assignment  also open colleges took a long time to give me my cert iii in fitness and when i did get it i was supposed to go straight to cert iv which is what i was told but i am now doing a transition course where i am still getting delays in marking  this has put me behind with my goals  i looked up the star rating on the internet and no one has given more than  stars so i think that sums it up
4,23-05-2017,informative,they are continually updating information to help people achieve in their choice of courses and making as easy as possible even for such an oldy as i am who hasn't done any courses since leaving school some  odd years ago

2,19-05-2017,a year long headache,open colleges is great if you don't have to talk to anyone and are a master of decoding i found going with open colleges was a real challenge to my sanity the assignments are cryptically worded i'm also a university graduate so i know my assignments i had instances in which it took days to get a reply and the response was a copy and pasted bit of text which hardly answered my questions i even had one moment where a question gave the wrong directions and it wasn't until i pointed it out because i kept getting the answer wrong by following the damn instructions in all fairness though i did complete my course in a year and have gained employment in my chosen pathway although i still don't have a certificate to show for my year of trials and tribulations because i cannot receive it until my payments are finished despite never missing a payment and actually getting better employment so i've finshed with nothing to show
2,19-05-2017,frustrating,cringy sales teaminconsistent grading standardsconvoluted assessmentshad a patronizing assessor who didn't listenthe original content was poorly worded and grammatically vague and the videos were all just free youtube videos

4,19-05-2017,start up process was all over the,start up process was all over the place different information giventrainers overall were really good and helpful just wish all the webinars were available for all modules was waiting for some to be uploaded or they were never uploaded especially when you are told they will be up by a certain date and a few months after there is still nothing available course wasn't new either so i feel this should of been all available especially when this is what was advertised when signing up and choosing open colleges to complete course

5,20-05-2017,my experience with open colleges was fantastic,my experience with open colleges was nothing but fantastic especially my tutor carole goldsmith who's help and guidance was exceptionali was planning to do your creative writing course but you have now removed all your nonaccredited courses which is a shame
2,19-05-2017,poor,poorcourse content was changed  months in doubling the work load trainer's response times were appalling on more than one occasion my feedback was addressed to the wrong person and the grading templates don't reflect the wording of the assessment's
5,19-05-2017,i've never liked study but loved,i've never liked study but loved everything about online colleges very convenient for me as i'm a shift worker easy to understand people to help when needed there was no pressure i would recommend online colleges to anyone who asked
4,19-05-2017,could be better,bad still haven't received my certificate even though i finished my course months ago slow to reply to messages or questionsdoesn't take into account fast students and locks the other curriculum folders for hrs which i hatedpros an easy and convenient study stylerelatively cheap repayments if you choose that option
1,19-05-2017,would not study with open colleges,terrible to deal with not flexible at all when it comes to changing courses the course material is often too basic to answer the assessment questions and the 'help' given by the trainers is generally useless
5,19-05-2017,the best decision i made,the best decision i made was to do this course not only did it help me reach a qualification  but the people i worked with made it more of a fun experience than a course it was easy to get a hold of who i needed to speak to i'm extremely happy with my results and i couldn't of achieved them with out the amazing help of the my trainor and student advisor
5,19-05-2017,open colleges offers great courses,open colleges offers great courses which go into sufficient depth i learned everything i wanted to know from my professional writing course
3,19-05-2017,could be better,i thought the help on answering questions was to long  i was very disappointed that i had to rush my nail tech course and have  months taken off my course with no  refund on the time lost  about
2,19-05-2017,overall i found the course to be very average,overall i found the course to be very disappointing although i managed to achieve the standard i believe i could have learnt moreassessmentsi found the assesment questions to be poorly written ambiguous and with simple spelling errors as the training institution it should be your job to ensure the students are set up for success the questions were very open ended and left it to the student to decifer its meaning the questions should be more direct to allow the student to tailor the answer accordinglystudent helpthe current student assist method is floored in that it is timely process that gives little to no guidance to the student
5,19-05-2017,i found it to be great and the online,i found it to be great and the online teachers of the course fantastic and very helpful
4,19-05-2017,great being able to study at your own paste,great being able to study at your own paste course materials are between average and outstanding teachers are sometimes helpful to guide you and give you directions on how to prepare your assessments number of assessments to submit were better since open colleges reviewed their course content and did their system upgradesimple and easy to study online
3,19-05-2017,the learning resources provided for mu,the learning resources provided for mu course were  years old and consequently had a lot of outofdate information this was disappointing also disappointing is that i was not asked to evaluate the course after i had concluded it had i been offered such an opportunity i could have provided this feedback at the time i completed the course more than  months agocommunication with the administrator and course instructor were both good
3,19-05-2017,i was really motivated by paying by the,i was really motivated by paying by the amount of time you took  so love the payment plan  i learned a lot but as the assignments don't cover a lot you can complete by only studying the material needed for the assignment so would like to see more to the assignments  the fact that i finished an  month course in  months did a lot for my selfesteem but it was so easy it made me wonder about the quality
5,19-05-2017,good course,good course plenty of understandable material and easy to learn and understand concepts
2,19-05-2017,had already done many courses which,had already done many courses which were equivalent but the evaluation process to know which courses i needed to complete to get my certificate took extremely long and received conflicting information also i was given access to complete courses i didnt require and was missing the ones i needed to complete it was a painful and frustrating experience for me
5,19-05-2017,great support and materials,great support and materials very positive experience
2,19-05-2017,the course material is incorrect,the course material is incorrect the tudors slow to respond and when they do not with an answer to the question which has been asked  very frustrating and disappointing experience
2,19-05-2017,disappointing,months after starting the course i received a phone call to ask what my decision was regarding transferring onto the updated course i was given no email letter or phone call prior to this to explain the situation because of the lack of communication the deadline had expired and i had no choice but to  transfer onto the new course and all of the work i had completed so far would not count for anything i had to stop my placement as according to the new course rules you are not allowed to start a placement until reaching a particular point this caused considerable upset and frustration with the professionals at the placement who viewed open colleges as unprofessional and disorganised they stated they would no longer accept anybody from open colleges as they didn't trust the institution to not behave in a professional way  the college placement tutor was taking several weeks to respond with my placement feedback so when i emailed to find out if everything was ok she admitted she had lost work that i had submitted and i needed to submit this again i feel if i had not chased her on the issue i would not have known this as no communication was sent to me overall the tutors were unhelpful lacked communication with one another for moderation of assessments and open space was poorly set up and had lots of issues with uploading various documents and videosi am very disappointed with the college and will not be recommending this institution in the future to anyone

2,19-05-2017,good material hard placement,the course material was great it was easy to follow and working through the assessments independently was relatively easy and support was always there when needed although when it came to work placement it was very hard to find anyone willing to take on a trainee and in my particular case i was bullied at the workplace i went to i would suggest that you offer workshops for your students to do the placement hours in a lot less stressful for the students i would recommend to friends if there was this support in the course
1,19-05-2017,i wouldn't recommend open colleges at,i wouldn't recommend open colleges at allthe course material wasn't correct and didn't relate to the assessments at all and the majority of the trainers weren't there to help
2,19-05-2017,overpriced for one,overpriced for one poor student support provide a fasade filled with hopes and dreams in regards to client outcomes job opportunities etc learning material is some areas was quite good some assessment questions were vague
3,19-05-2017,there were many errors in the course,there were many errors in the course and even when i told them the error it didn't seem to be correctedwhen emailing lecturers for support often went unanswered so you just had to muddle along on your ownthere were some very good employees up until dec  and then they all disappeared leaving absences that were not filled satisfactorythe assessments were some very poorly written and you just felt like you were muddling along with little supporti think there needs to be a big overhaul of this establishment and actually help the students that have many big
5,19-05-2017,flexible learning with good support,i appreciated the flexibility the courses offered tuition staff were excellent in giving constructive feedback and support working full time and trying to complete this course could not have been possible without open collegethey would be my first choice if i needed to do another course

3,19-05-2017,there has been a bit of dip in the,there has been a bit of dip in the quality of this course with but it could be due to ironing out glitches in the restructured course  the material has some improvements but also good things about the old material have been lost such as the instructional videos and the ability to make rapid changes to the website to fix issues  it also takes some trainers a long time to respond to questions but again that is probably due to ironing out issues with the new material
5,19-05-2017,michael davidson was an absolute,michael davidson was an absolute champion student advisor full of encouragement and definitely made my experience with open colleges an enjoyable and successful onei'd  recommend open colleges to anyone and have already suggested a few friends to use you guys for their further education
1,19-05-2017,elementary standard of teaching,unhelpful outdated and elementary course work was not helpful and irrelevant teachers are not equipped properly as some of the courses offered shouldn't be available online studying online with open colleges is full of frustration and anxiety as the system is not working half the time and help and support staff are useless i was once told 'i did not care about my studies' when i complained the website was constantly unavailable all i did was simply ask if they could fix the issues with websites
5,19-05-2017,excellent experience,excellent experience excellent support amazing tutors
1,19-05-2017,content and assignments are riddled,content and assignments are riddled with mistakescourse supervisors don't reply for weeks at times not all of them but most of themreplies are often cut and pasted from the course content which isn't helpfultopic assessors go missing or you just don't have onestaff changes all the time make it impossible to maintain any continuitythe only thing these guys manage to do in an efficient manner is take your moneyfind someone else anyone else

1,17-05-2017,do not study with open colleges,i can't believe i even have to give open colleges an entire star they are underqualified even for thateverything is wrong about this place it is overpriced and they lock you in with a seven day census the course work is out of date the spelling and grammar is horrendous the assignments are way over the top and god help you if you ever wanted to get out of a course they muck you around to absolutely no enddo yourself a favour and just don't do it find somewhere else

5,15-05-2017,open colleges review,affordable courses extremely helpful staff intuitive online space level of difficulty and expectations appropriate for people of all ages with varying life circumstances would reccomend to friends with busy life schedules or people looking for a new way to learn
2,15-05-2017,the flexibility of online learning is the only positive i have found so far to this course,no one answers your questions online or it takes ages to actually receive an answer to your emails the next module doesn't get automatically unlocked after submitting the assessments so it feels like everything is gone to make you waste time so that you won't be able to finish the bourse in due time and would then have to pay extra money to study longer also after reading the course and all the documents in the links i still felt like i had to do a lot of personal research to be able to answer their portfolio questions and written assessment sometimes it really felt like the matter hadn't been mentioned on the module at all some questions are also unclear too vague so you don't know if you're answering properly or not
5,15-05-2017,excellent college,the information service and friendliness of staff is fabulous  i highly recommend open colleges to anyone who is seriously interested in gaining a certificate  they are always there for you the site is easy to navigate and information abounds  fabulous

2,15-05-2017,terrible,terribleit's been  month now and this is one of the worst decisions i've made in my  years on this planetin the beginning i noticed spelling and grammatical errors in the content cert electro tech moving on from that i began my first assessment only to find questions relating to topics not covered in my learning material after hours of scouring the material thinking i'd missed something i tried my best and submitted the assessment only to receive failure notice with a comment to refer to x section in the training material i then spent more time hours referring to x section in the training material and could not find the information required i double checked with the trainer who came back with a comment that i was right the relevant material is actually missing sorry i was then told they expected i'd already have knowledge of this topic prior to signing up to the course however the course has no prerequisitesnext i moved onto module  only to find serious problems with the content here as well section x is a mirror image of section y but with different titles after  hours i received confirmation that they had made a mistake with a system update and that it would be fixed the following day this is not great for me considering today is my day off my study day and tomorrow i'm back at worki will do everything i can to cancel this course and see about doing it at tafe instead
5,15-05-2017,open colleges are supportive and very,open colleges are supportive and very informative glad i made the jump they were never pushy and understood that i had to work out my finances before i could start anything
5,14-05-2017,it is a very supportive team,it is a very supportive team but unless you can work alone and not in a classroom environment it is not the style of studying for everyone
4,03-05-2017,online study with open colleges,online study with open collegeshaving not studied for many years i found the online course challenging but rewarding the biggest difficulty i had was uploading the videos in module   i also found completing the written portfolio requirements for the work placement module  frustrating  the instructions were tedious and confusing for each portfolio and i found this quite stressful  the assessment phone calls were difficult to schedule during my placement as the timing was often inconvenient in a busy workplacethe support i received was terrific and the response time to my queries was very short i feel very relieved satisfied and rewarded to have come to the end of my online training course and look forward to receiving my certificate

4,24-04-2017,had a lot of good experiences so far,had a lot of good experiences with open colleges with my course so far i've found that the assessors are very helpful and friendly the student support always seems happy to help and have always helped me when i needed it the bad side is that you have to do all the learning yourself which can be difficult when you can't find the motivation i wish they had more learning activities like actual worksheets and things like that to help learn and remember things better like back in high school i love how you have multiple attempts at the assessments since i suffer from test anxiety and completely screw up when under pressure so at least that takes the pressure off and the assessor feedback helps with getting a better mark next time as well as helping me understand the questions betteri really like open colleges and everything is good so far with them
3,24-04-2017,well i don't like just having the one,well i don't like just having the one module at a time access as it does become boring very fast i'd like say the first  modules openin the beginning you receive a lot of support then time has lapsed and life has got in the way yet no one has made contact in months i know i'm responsible for allowing my lapse due to life would of liked someone to check in again to see if i need help which i do i have contact numbers just life got in the way and i never get there so maybe at least monthly check in
5,23-04-2017,studying with open colleges,the content for the animal studies and captive animals pathway course is easy to follow and understand and the training assessors are always contactable via email with any questions you have along the way the feedback with each exam is constructive and positive and the training materials covers the course adequately external research is always encouraged as this is the difference between a high distinction and a distinction

4,21-04-2017,it was all going great and i was very,it was all going great and i was very happy with the course overall but this module  payroll which is the one i am in now is really poor in all sense of the word the learning material is not too complete assessment  is a mess specially at the beginning i had to google so many things to complete my assessment because the information from the learning material doesnt say too much plus the assessor takes his time to answer our questions and in consequence we are stuck with no possibility to continue for days as we have to wait for his answer or grades i am just wasting time and days when i only have to wait for an answer really frustrating

4,19-04-2017,thanks,everyone has been great very helpful and understanding
4,19-04-2017,review of open colleges,was able to work at my own pace all of materials needed were posted and easily accessible on the website tutors and assessors were prompt with turnaround of assessments and feedback on work produced student support services were fantastic with their knowledge and assistance the course layout encouraged independence and self motivation and as an only negative my concern would be for those that needed a more personal approach to their tuition however this approach although initially difficult to address developed within me stronger determination and persistence and eventually enabled me to complete the course and look forward to further study with greater confidence
3,18-04-2017,good but be careful before you choose,it was good to learn with open colleges although sometimes was stressing with communication with the trainers support team harder to learn online not for everyone and need to learn patience while studying if you choose to go ahead
2,18-04-2017,not happy,no help after you sign up
4,18-04-2017,open colleges keep things moving easily,open colleges keep things moving easily with each new module     working out current assessments was initially a challenge   they are easy to talk with
